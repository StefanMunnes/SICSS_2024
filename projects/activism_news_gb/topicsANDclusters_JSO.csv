"1","5 Just Stop Oil Supporters Found Guilty As UN Slams Trial",2024-07-11,"Five Just Stop Oil supporters were convicted of conspiracy to cause public nuisance at Southwark Crown Court today for planning to disrupt the M25 by climbing motorway gantries in November 2022, to demand an end to new oil and gas licensing, a demand that has just been met by the incoming Labour government. [1][2] The five defendants – Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam (57, from Wales), Daniel Shaw (38, from Northampton), Lucia Whittaker De Abreu (34, from Derby), Louise Lancaster (58, from Cambridge) and Cressida Gethin (22, from Hereford) – have been remanded until their sentencing hearing next Thursday. The jury entered guilty verdicts against all defendants after Judge Christopher Hehir removed all legal defences, ruling that the climate crisis was ‘irrelevant’ to the trial. He has indicated they now face lengthy prison sentences, despite the UN intervening publicly to question the legality of proceedings. Four of the five defendants (Mr Hallam, Ms Lancaster, Ms Gethin and Mr Shaw), gave evidence at trial. After taking the oath to ‘tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth’, they refused to comply with the judge’s direction to finish their evidence without explaining their reasons for taking action. When cross-examined by the prosecutor, Jocelyn Ledward KC, Mr Shaw said: “I’d be happy to answer the prosecutor’s questions, but not until I’ve finished giving evidence”. Others responded in a similar vein. They then refused to leave the witness box, before honouring their oath to the jury to tell the whole truth. On each occasion, the judge first cleared the public gallery, then ordered them to be arrested and imprisoned. The four missed substantial parts of the trial proceedings as a result. They were permitted twenty minutes to make closing speeches, which they had to prepare for from the cells. The judge ordered that the four he had imprisoned make their closing speeches from the dock, behind glass. Mr Hallam said: “I took an oath before God to tell you the truth; and we have received no good reason why we have not been allowed to tell you what is blindingly obvious and what I’m not allowed to tell you about; if you have not been able to hear what is blindingly obvious, it’s not a fair trial … If thousands of people were going to die further up the motorway, we would have a reasonable excuse” Mr Shaw said: “A few years ago when I was working for social services, before I was ever arrested, before I was ever in prison; there was a key test for me: what will people think in 20 or 30 years when we look back on this; was what we did, what happened on the M25, trying to stop the government from destroying society, was it really a public nuisance?” Ms Lancaster said: “I wrote this in a cell with a blue pencil, forgive me. We are being systematically silenced … Public nuisance? I acted in the public good. How can direct action to prevent cataclysmic harm to the general public not be in the public good. ‘Public nuisance’. Pernicious words. It’s not unlawful for a group committed to bring about change to protect life.” Ms Gethin said: “People are dying already, my generation is being cast into the dust … We are told this is a functioning democracy, but that direct actions like this are not justified … it is in that democracy that no one has been held responsible for the billions of pounds wasted on PPE, for the lives lost in Grenfell tower, for the Post Office scandal. Is it justice when the powerful are not held to account, and citizens are prosecuted for calling them out? This is why we have a jury system. Juries have common sense and, other than us, you are the only ones that are not paid to be here.” Ms Whittaker De Abreu said: “But now that the UN representative has returned to Geneva, the judge has gone back to where he started, saying that the existential threat to all our lives is irrelevant and that we can’t even talk about it at all! I’m sorry if I’m missing something … But I don’t understand how this is happening. It doesn’t make any sense. I feel like we’re being gaslit. I feel like I’m going mad. I feel like I’m in a horror movie. I want to wake up from this.” On 24 June, the first day of the trial, the UN Special Rapporteur for Environmental Defenders, Michel Forst, issued an extraordinary public statement questioning the legality of proceedings. With the trial ongoing, the statement has not been reportable until now. It states: [3] “In my letter of 12 March 2024 to the government of the United Kingdom, I expressed my serious concern about the arrest, very lengthy remand in prison and harsh bail conditions of Mr. Shaw as a result of his involvement in peaceful environmental protest to call for urgent government action concerning the climate crisis … Following his arrest, Mr. Shaw spent 113 days in prison on remand. When eventually released from remand, he has been subject to a range of highly draconian bail conditions including, among others, a 10pm-7am curfew, an electronic monitoring tag, a requirement to sleep at his home address every night, a prohibition from having either direct or indirect contact with any of his co-defendants and a prohibition from participating in any climate change demonstration. Mr. Shaw has been subject to most of these severe restrictions on his personal life for nearly one and a half years … I have now received new information regarding the imminent criminal trial of Mr. Shaw that I consider deeply concerning. With Mr. Shaw’s criminal trial set to start today, on 24 June 2024, I have been informed that Mr. Shaw may reasonably expect to face a prison sentence of up to two years (or more) for, in essence, his participation in a Zoom call to discuss a proposed peaceful environmental protest. The imposition of such sanction is not only appalling but may also violate the United Kingdom’s obligations under international law.” Mr Forst, together with a colleague from the UN, attended the trial in person last Thursday and Friday. It is understood that he may issue a further statement on what he witnessed in due course. On the day that Michel Forst attended court, the judge agreed the jury could be presented with a set of ‘Facts Not In Dispute’, which acknowledged ‘i) that the climate crisis is an ‘existential threat to humanity’; ii) that breaching the 1.5˚C global temperature limit risks catastrophic and irreversible harm; iii) that that limit is predicted to be breached permanently by 2030; iv) that as at the time of the action, the Government kept issuing new oil and gas licences’. [4] Despite this information being presented to the jury, following the departure of Mr Forst from the trial, the judge directed the jury to treat the existential threat to humanity as “irrelevant” and to ignore it entirely. Furthermore, despite the admission of these matters in evidence as objective ‘Facts Not In Dispute’, Judge Hehir continued to refer to the defendants’ motivations for taking action as matters of “political opinion or belief”. On 2 July, 11 people sat quietly outside Southwark Crown Court holding signs saying  “Juries deserve to hear the whole truth” and “Juries have the absolute right to acquit a defendant on their conscience.” Judge Hehir ordered the police to arrest them. A 12th person, holding a blank sign, was not arrested. The judge’s order appeared to fly in the face of the recent High Court judgement on the issue, dismissing the Solicitor General’s application for contempt of court against Trudi Warner for holding a similar sign: [5] “[I]t is fanciful to suggest that Ms Warner’s behaviour falls into this category of contempt. The category is limited to threatening, intimidatory, abusive conduct or other forms of harassment … The prosecution of the Insulate Britain cases, the decisions of law reached by judges in those cases, and the scope for the jury to hear evidence on matters of conscience in relation to offences allegedly committed as acts of political protest have become matters of serious public debate … A criminal prosecution is a disproportionate approach to this situation in a democratic society.” The following Tuesday, more than 80 people returned to Southwark Crown Court holding similar signs, in solidarity with those previously arrested. This time the judge left them undisturbed. A spokesperson for the ‘Defend Our Juries’ campaign said: [6] “On Tuesday 2 July, Judge Hehir had 11 people arrested for holding signs outside court which said ‘Juries deserve to hear the whole truth’. He did this on the basis the signs were a serious interference with the course of justice, despite a recent High Court ruling that the criminalisation of such signs was disproportionate in a democratic society. The following Tuesday more than 80 people held the same sign outside court, and Judge Hehir left them alone. It’s hard to make sense of that unless Judge Hehir now realises he got it wrong. In which case he should apologise to those he arrested and make proper reparation.” Following a pattern of jury acquittals in climate action cases, some judges have been taking exceptional measures to preclude ‘not guilty’ verdicts, undermining the certainty and predictability that is meant to define the rule of law. In some cases defendants have even been banned from mentioning ‘climate change’ in court, and sent to prison just for doing so. On the other hand, others have continued to allow defendants to explain their motivation to protect life and health and to defend themselves on that basis. Last November a jury acquitted nine women who broke windows at HSBC in 2021, causing an alleged £500,000 of damage. By the end of 2022 HSBC had committed to end funding for new oil and gas projects.[7] [8] [9] [10] Meanwhile in April of this year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Swiss government had violated the Article 8 rights of an association of senior Swiss women, by failing to enact adequate climate policies to protect them from the health impacts of heatwaves. Given that the High Court ruled in early May that the UK Government’s climate plans are irrational and unlawful, it follows that the Article 8 rights of the British public are being violated too.

"2","World Snooker Championships Disruptors Sentenced",2024-07-10,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters, Margaret Reid and Eddie Whittingham, were sentenced today at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court following their conviction for disrupting the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre last April. They interrupted the championship to call on the government to stop all new UK fossil fuel projects and to encourage UK sporting institutions to join the fight against the government’s genocidal fossil fuel policies. Margaret Reid, 53, a former museum professional from Kendal, Cumbria, was found guilty of attempting to cause criminal damage, while Eddie Whittingham, 26, was found guilty of criminal damage after a one-day trial. On 17 April 2023, during a first-round match at the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre, Eddie climbed onto a snooker table and threw orange powder paint, disrupting the match. Margaret also attempted to carry out the action on another table but was intercepted by referee Olivier Marteel before she could begin. The sentences handed down by the court were as follows: Margaret Reid received a 2-year community order, 100 hours of unpaid work, 10 days of rehabilitative activities, £390 in court costs, and a £115 victim surcharge, while Eddie Whittingham received an 18-month community order, 200 hours of community service, 25 days of rehabilitative activities, and about £1,200 in costs in total. Margaret Reid questioned the priorities of the justice system, stating: “What should the criminal justice system be putting its energy into? Cracking down on me for getting half my backside onto a snooker table, or prosecuting the real criminals who are keeping us locked into reliance on deadly fossil fuels? We are hurtling towards climate breakdown and the collapse of society. The evidence mounts up every day. But the scientists who bear witness to it are ignored and the ordinary people who try to raise the alarm are prosecuted. Meanwhile it’s comfortable business as usual for the criminal justice system, for the people who are supposed to protect us and for the fossil fuel giants. Business as usual will destroy our futures. I am not scared of the criminal justice system. It can throw whatever it wants at me. But I am scared of a future where millions of people are starving, and where whole populations will be forced from their homes. I am sorry for the disruption caused to individuals at that tournament – but the impacts of climate breakdown will be far worse and will affect everyone who was in that room. How long before the real criminals are held to account for their reckless criminal damage and irreversible destruction of life?” Eddie Whittingham, a former student at Exeter University, said before the sentencing: “It doesn’t matter what they do to us. They can arrest us, they can stick us in prison. But the world’s leading scientists have just said that we’re almost certainly going over 2.5°C of global warming. This is a f**king catastrophe. Get on the streets and join us this summer as we take action at airports.” Until leaders act to protect us, Just Stop Oil supporters will continue to take the proportional action necessary to generate political pressure.

"3","Jury out in historic Just Stop Oil conspiracy case",2024-07-10,"The jury is now deliberating the verdict in a case involving Just Stop Oil supporters Daniel Shaw, Cressie Gethin, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, Louise Lancaster, and Roger Hallam. The five are currently on trial at Southwark Crown Court. They are charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance in connection with the M25 gantry actions in November 2022. They were first arrested in 2022 either pre-emptively in police raids at their homes after attending a Zoom call (in which a Sun journalist was present), or travelling near the M25. The Sun alleged it had ‘infiltrated’ the meeting, tipping off the police and enabling National Highways to secure a public injunction. Some of the five defendants were imprisoned for up to 113 days without trial. They were released subject to stringent conditions including a 10pm to 7am house curfew, stipulations not to be within a one-mile radius of the M25, no contact with other defendants, and not to participate in any climate change demonstration. The trial began on 24th June, presided over by Crown Court Judge Hehir. At the start of the trial, the office of the UN Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders released a statement expressing its views on the criminal prosecution of Daniel Shaw. Due to his “grave concerns” about the criminalisation of UK environmental defenders, Special Rapporteur Michel Forst attended the trial in person on 4th and 5th July. [1] During the trial so far, Judge Hehir has ordered nine separate arrests from the courtroom: three times each for Roger Hallam and Daniel Shaw, twice for Louise Lancaster, and once for Cressie Gethin. Additionally, the defendants have collectively spent seven nights in remand since the trial began, with Daniel, Roger, and Louise each spending two nights, and Cressie spending one night. On the 4th of July, the prosecution made a historic concession by admitting to the following, in the list of agreed facts to be presented for the jury’s consideration: “1. On 17 December 2020, Her Majesty’s Treasury published the New Zero Interim Report which states, ‘Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. Without global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the climate will change catastrophically with almost unimaginable consequences for societies across the world.’ In recognition of the risks, the UK became, in 2019, the first major economy to implement a legally binding net zero target. 2. Scientific consensus is that beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels risks catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity, which will be irreversible. 3. Over the past five years, the global average temperature rise since pre-industrial times has averaged just under 1.3 degrees Celsius. For the 12 months to June 2024, it averaged 1.63 degrees Celsius and is estimated to top 1.5 degrees Celsius permanently before 2030. 4. In October 2022, the UK Government opened the 33rd licensing round to allow oil and gas companies to explore for more fossil fuels in the North Sea.” Despite the presence of these agreed facts and the explicit provision for the defence of ‘reasonable excuse’ under section 78 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, Judge Hehir ruled that the defendants would not be allowed any defence under law, repeating at various points in the trial as well as in his written directions to the jury that any facts pertaining to “man-made climate change” were “entirely irrelevant” to the defendants’ charges.","https://juststopoil.org/2024/07/10/jury-out-in-historic-just-stop-oil-conspiracy-case/",3
"4","‘Paint the town orange!’ – Just Stop Oil wins first demand",2024-07-10,"Four Just Stop Oil supporters have painted Parliament Square orange to celebrate winning Just Stop Oil’s original demand, that the UK Government commit to ending all new licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration and extraction. [1] At around 8:30 this morning, four supporters began pouring orange cornstarch-based children’s powder-paint across three intersections leading into Parliament Square. Cars proceeded to drive through the paint spreading it around the road that encircles the square. One of those taking action this morning is Sheila Shatford, 69, an NHS nurse and grandmother from Bristol, who said: “Just Stop Oil has won their demand for no new oil and gas, however this is not enough. Now we must demand internationally coordinated action to phase out fossil fuels. Labour must commit to cancelling all oil and gas licences granted by the Tories in their final arson spree before they left office.” “To our new government: we have put our trust in you to keep us safe. It’s time to work with other countries to sign an international, legally binding treaty to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. Oil Kills. It’s time to protect our country and our communities. Sign the treaty!” Today’s action comes in the wake of the new governments’ commitment to end new oil and gas licensing, in line with Just Stop Oil’s original demand, which was first issued to the UK government on 14th February 2022. During April and August 2022, Just Stop Oil supporters engaged in two rounds of disrupting the flow of oil out of key terminals around the country, causing many service stations to run out of petrol and diesel. By the 25th September 2022, the Financial Times reported Keir Starmer had pledged to end new oil and gas. This was reaffirmed on the 24th Oct 2022 when Just Stop Oil supporter, Fiona Atkinson, spoke to Keir Starmer on Nick Ferrari’s program on LBC, where the Labour leader re-stated his commitment to ending new oil and gas. Throughout 2022, mentions of ‘Just Stop Oil’ were up 400% and the campaign reached 92% name recognition nationally by November 2022. [2][3] Throughout 2023, the saliency of the topic continued to increase, with press mentions of ‘new oil and gas’ increasing a further 23% during the year. This culminated in Rishi Sunak committing to ‘max out’ North Sea oil and gas- a story which made the front pages of The Guardian, Mirror, Telegraph, Times and The Metro on 1st Aug 2023, with the Mirror running “Just Stop Sunak” as their main title. By November 2023, polling demonstrated that Just Stop Oil actions create a positive ‘radical flank’ effect, by building support for more moderate groups, through the use of radical tactics. [4][5] Throughout the past 2 1/2 years evidence has continued to mount that disapproval of disruptive tactics utilised by climate defenders, has had no negative impact on support for the cause itself, whilst forcing the issue to the top of the political agenda, through a process known as ‘agenda seeding’. [6] Also taking action today is Deborah Wilde, 68, a retired teacher from London who said: “The evidence is in, and disruptive civil resistance gets the goods! For two and a half years, Just Stop Oil supporters have been taking action to force the debate around new oil and gas up the news agenda and to the forefront of voter’s minds. We appreciate the new governments’ commitment to ending new oil and gas, but there is already enough carbon in the atmosphere to wreak havoc to our society and economy in the coming years. Labour must cancel all fossil fuel licences green-lit by the Tories and sign the fossil fuel treaty to end burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.” Civil resistance works. In the past year we have seen victories in Sweden and the Netherlands and now the UK. However, as long as political leaders fail to take swift and decisive action to protect our communities from the worst effects of climate breakdown, Just Stop Oil supporters, working with other groups internationally, will take the proportional action necessary to generate much needed political pressure. This summer, areas of key importance to the fossil fuel economy will be declared sites of civil resistance around the world. Sign up to take action at juststopoil.org.

"5","UN Special Rapporteur Attends Trial of Just Stop Oil Supporters at Southwark Crown Court",2024-07-04,"UN Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention and former UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders Michel Forst is attending the ongoing trial of five Just Stop Oil supporters at Southwark Crown Court today. The special rapporteur’s office released a statement on 24th June detailing his views regarding the criminal prosecution of Daniel Shaw in this trial. The statement can be read here. [1] The Aarhus Convention, to which the UK is a signatory, aims to promote environmental democracy by ensuring public access to information, participation in decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters. The Special Rapporteur monitors the implementation of the convention’s provisions by its parties, ensuring compliance with obligations related to access to justice. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur investigates complaints from individuals or groups alleging violations of their rights under the Aarhus Convention, assesses specific cases, and makes recommendations to ensure compliance. Daniel Shaw, Cressie Gethin, Lucia De-Abreu-Whittaker, Louise Lancaster and Roger Hallam are currently on trial at Southwark Crown Court, charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance in connection with the M25 gantry actions in November 2022. They were arrested either pre-emptively in police raids at their homes after attending a Zoom call in which a Sun journalist was present, or arrested travelling near the M25 respectively. The Sun alleged it had ‘infiltrated’ the meeting and boasted of tipping off the police and enabling National Highways to secure a public injunction. Some of these five were imprisoned for up to 113 days without trial. They were released subject to stringent conditions including a 10 pm to 7 am house curfew, not to be within a one-mile radius of the M25, no contact with other defendants and not to participate in any climate change demonstration. In another trial involving Just Stop Oil supporters, which was the first under the new Public Order Act 2023 for a Section 7 offence, Judge Hehir who is overseeing the current proceedings barred all legal defences from the defendants and prohibited any mention of the climate crisis to the jury. This trial concluded with a conviction, and Judge Hehir is expected to sentence the defendants at a future date.

"6","We refuse to die for fossil fuels – Just Stop Oil response to police raids resulting in at least 27 arrests.",2024-06-28,"Over the last 12 hours the British state has acted unlawfully in detaining a total of at least 27 ordinary people sharing food at a community event and at their homes. Their only crime? They are Just Stop Oil supporters. Being a Just Stop Oil supporter is now enough to make you a suspect. Believing that no government has the right to tyrannise the entire world by encouraging the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, marks you out as a dangerous radical. But we will not be intimidated. The painful truth right now is that our politicians and corporations have no intention of acting in accordance with the fundamental interests of either our young people or the country as a whole. Not content with cheering on war crimes in Gaza, our politicians have sat by and allowed the last government to licence yet more oil, making them complicit in the greatest crime in human history. Continuing to extract and burn oil, gas and coal is an act of war against humanity that will result in unimaginable suffering and destroy the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. No one has ever voted for this, there has never been a democratic mandate to destroy the habitable world. Just Stop Oil supporters are deeply committed to protecting their families and communities from the tyranny of fossil fuels. If our government refuses to do what is right to protect humanity, then people will step up to do what needs to be done. We refuse to die for fossil fuels and we refuse to stand by while millions are murdered. That’s why we are joining an international uprising taking nonviolent collective action to defend humanity. Sign up to take action at juststopoil.org. We demand that our government stops the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030 and that they support and finance other countries to make a fast, fair and just transition. They must sign the Fossil Fuel Treaty to end the war on humanity before we lose everything. Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"7","Just Stop Oil’s Rugby disruptors found ‘Not Guilty’ by Crown Court jury",2024-06-25,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters who disrupted the Gallagher Premiership Rugby final in May 2023 were acquitted today at Kingston Crown Court. The unanimous 11-member jury found Samuel Johnson and Dr. Patrick Hart not guilty of the charge of criminal damage exceeding £5,000. [1] On 27th May 2023, the two supporters stormed the pitch in a cloud of cornstarch-based orange powder paint at Twickenham, where the Saracens were facing off against the Sale Sharks. They were demanding an immediate halt to any new licences for oil, gas, and coal projects in the UK. Dr. Patrick Hart, a 38 year old GP from Bristol, said today: “Normal people recognise that civil resistance is absolutely essential to break through the lies of the politicians, fossil fuel companies and banks who are destroying life on earth. I told the jury that I am taking the most effective action I can, on the best available evidence, to protect the health of my patients. To put it simply: I am doing my duty as a doctor.” During the trial, the prosecution relied on the detailed, hours-long testimony of the groundskeeper. He explained that, unlike a similar action by Just Stop Oil supporters at the men’s Ashes Test at Lord’s, where the cornstarch was easily cleared with a leaf blower, the Twickenham pitch features a hybrid grass system that combines a natural grass sublayer with synthetic plastic grass. However, the testimony did not establish that ordinary people would have known the intricacies of Twickenham’s pitch maintenance, making it difficult for the prosecution to prove that the defendants had the criminal intent to cause the alleged damage. One of those acquitted, Sam Johnson, a 41-year-old construction worker from Essex, commented on the outcome: “A year ago, Patrick and I ran onto Twickenham during the Premiership final, throwing orange powder in the air. Today, we have been found not guilty of criminal damage. I took part in this action because our politicians continue to issue licences, knowing full well it will result in the deaths of millions of people. Thousands have died due to extreme heat brought on by climate change while we were on trial. This is happening now!” Until leaders act to protect us, Just Stop Oil supporters will continue to take the proportional action necessary to generate political pressure.

"8","I’ve got a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty baby, and I’ll write your name: Just Stop Oil paint private jets hours after Taylor Swift’s lands",2024-06-20,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted multiple private jets on the airfield where Taylor Swift’s jet landed mere hours before. They are demanding that the incoming UK government commit to working with other governments to agree an equitable plan to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. [1] At around 5:00 am Jennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald entered the private airfield at Stansted airport where Swift’s jet is currently stationed. The pair painted two private jets using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint. Cole Macdonald, 22, from Brighton, said “We’re living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions. Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending ‘cruel summer’. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.” Jennifer Kowalski, 28, who is a former sustainability manager from Dumbarton, said: “Over the years, I’ve had to realise that even working in sustainability provides me with essentially no ability to make the necessary changes to prevent the complete collapse of our natural systems. I have to take desperate measures to make my voice heard.” “In 2024 we all have to be considering what we can do each day to change the course our society is on. We need an emergency treaty to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.” It is estimated that 80% of the world’s population has never taken a flight. Just 1% of people cause 50% of global aviation emissions. Private jet users are responsible for up to 14x as much carbon emissions compared with a commercial flight. A single flight in a private jet can easily emit as much carbon dioxide as the average annual carbon footprint for an EU citizen – 8.2 tonnes. [2] [3] [4] The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty is a initiative for world governments to agree an emergency rescue plan that rapidly and fairly phases out deadly emissions. Wealthy developed countries with historically high carbon emissions will be the priority, ending oil and gas usage by 2030. Developing countries will follow in a logical and just transition. [5] A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Whilst governments are allowing oil corporations to run amok destroying our communities, the actions of individuals mean very little. That’s why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030. Failure to defend the people they represent will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own Governments do not take meaningful action.” Until world leaders act to protect us, Just Stop Oil supporters, working with other groups internationally, will take the proportional action necessary to generate much needed political pressure.

They are demanding that the incoming UK government commit to working with other governments to agree an equitable plan to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. [1] At around 12pm, the two supporters began spraying the iconic rocks at the ancient site near Salisbury. Tomorrow thousands are expected to descend on the site to celebrate the Summer Solstice. Today’s action has come days after the Labour party’s manifesto has recommitted them to stopping all future licences for new oil and gas, should they form the next government. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “The UK’s government in waiting has committed to enacting Just Stop Oil’s original demand of ‘no new oil and gas’. However, we all know this is not enough. Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything. That’s why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.

Stone circles can be found in every part of Europe showing how we’ve always cooperated across vast distances – we’re building on that legacy.” One of those taking action this morning is Niamh Lynch, 21, a Student from Oxford, who said: “Stonehenge at solstice is all about celebrating the natural world – but look at the state it’s in! We all have a right to live a life free from suffering, but continued burning of oil, coal and gas is leading to death and suffering on an unparalleled scale.” “It’s time for us to think about what our civilization will leave behind – what is our legacy? Standing inert for generations works well for stones – not climate policy.” Also taking action is Rajan Naidu, 73, from Birmingham, who said: “Either we end the fossil fuel era, or the fossil fuel era will end us. Just as fifty years ago, when the world used international treaties to defuse the threats posed by nuclear weapons, today the world needs a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to phase out fossil fuels and to support dependent economies, workers and communities to move away from oil, gas and coal.” “The orange cornflour we used to create an eye-catching spectacle will soon wash away with the rain, but the urgent need for effective government action to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of the climate and ecological crisis will not. Sign the treaty!” Until world leaders act to protect us, Just Stop Oil supporters, working with other groups internationally, will take the proportional action necessary to generate much needed political pressure. This summer, areas of key importance to the fossil fuel economy will be declared sites of civil resistance around the world.

"10","North Warwickshire Borough Council use public money to protect oil companies",2024-06-17,"North Warwickshire Borough Council are seeking to use public money to make an interim injunction banning protest at Kingsbury oil terminal, permanent. Just Stop Oil supporters took action at the terminal in 2022 and are currently demanding an emergency plan to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. [1] More than 15 Just Stop Oil supporters, named in the injunction filed by North Warwickshire Borough Council, appeared before Judge Kelly at the Royal Courts of Justice for a hearing that commenced on Tuesday 11th June. The council aims to extend the injunction against ‘persons unknown’ to prevent all future protests outside the terminal in Tamworth, operated by Shell, Essar, and Valero Energy Corporation. Lawyers for North Warwickshire council argued that the interim injunction granted in 2022 should be made permanent to stop protests at the terminal. This effectively means the council is using taxpayers’ money to protect a private oil company facility. Judge Kelly is likely to take a few weeks to reach a decision on whether the injunction can be extended. [2] In a surprising development, NWBC’s counsel revealed in court that the council would not be seeking costs from any named defendants regarding the injunction. [3] At the start of the trial, the judge highlighted the council’s failure to comply with a previous order concerning the service of notice to defendants. Some defendants received notice as late as two days before the trial began. None of the defendants had any legal representation and were informed in court that each individual wishing to give a closing statement in the civil proceedings would need to file a new application, costing £300 each. Ultimately, three supporters made the application in record time and were granted permission by Judge Kelly to deliver closing statements. Alyson Lee, 65, retired teaching assistant from Derby, was allowed to give a closing statement. In 2022, she was sentenced to 16 days at Foston Hall prison in Derby for holding a sign on a grass verge outside the terminal. In part of her closing statement on Wednesday, she said: “We find ourselves in unprecedented circumstances where governments of the world are supporting the fossil fuel corporations in their genocidal businesses. There is something particularly distressing about a local authority spending time and resources on protecting one of the richest industries on earth, whilst its own residents are vulnerable to harms caused by that industry (e.g. flooding, heatwaves, food inflation and food insecurity). The council needs to be putting its time and money into preparing for climate breakdown and protecting its citizens from all the consequences of that.” Another defendant named on the injunction is Chloe Naldrett, 44, a theatre producer and mother of two from Bristol. She was sent to Foston Hall prison in Derby for 6 days in 2022, also for holding a sign outside the terminal. She said in part of her closing statement: “The people listed on this injunction did not break it for fun. We did it out of a sense of duty and moral and social responsibility, and because we have tried literally everything else to raise the alarm and try to persuade the Government to respond appropriately to the existential threat that is posed by our relentless heating of the planet.” “The group of people named on this injunction includes doctors, social workers, electricians, clergy, teachers, nurses, farmers, students. Deeply moral, deeply responsible, entirely ordinary people. A huge number of us are parents. Many are grandparents. We love our children, our families, our communities, and we love this beautiful, fragile world to which we are doing so much damage.” “Ordinary people are being abused by oil companies: not the other way around. I broke this injunction to make a point about how justice in this country can be purchased, and how it is therefore open to exploitation by wealthy companies.” The trial comes amidst growing criticism of the use of “persons unknown” injunctions, which have proliferated over the past two years. These injunctions target unknown defendants to ensnare as many individuals as possible, often without their knowledge. Sixteen people have already served up to 85 days in jail for breaching the same injunction that the council now seeks to extend. On a single day in September 2022, over 50 people were arrested based on this injunction, with six jailed and most receiving two-year suspended sentences. [4] Friends of the Earth is challenging the use of injunctions against “persons unknown” at the European Court of Human Rights. Katie de Kauwe, a lawyer at Friends of the Earth has described anti-protest injunctions as a “confusing, opaque, parallel system of prohibitions” used by private companies and public authorities to create their own public order laws. [5] The UN Rapporteur for Environmental Defenders has strongly criticised the draconian clampdown on the right to protest in England and Wales, particularly the use of civil injunctions.

[1] Four Just Stop Oil supporters also visited the four biggest parties to hand-deliver the letter, which can be read here. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “The UK’s next government in waiting has committed to enacting Just Stop Oil’s original demand of ‘no new oil and gas’ in the upcoming election. This is a major victory for anyone who cares about protecting our communities from the catastrophe being imposed on ordinary people by fossil-fueled elites and corporations. However, this commitment will not be enough to prevent ongoing collapse, whilst fossil fuel projects are still being built here and around the world. Scientists are clear that the carbon currently in the atmosphere will be enough on its own to make large parts of the world uninhabitable in years to come. It is clear that continuing to extract and burn fossil fuels in 2024 is nothing short of an act of war against humanity. As such, we are demanding party leaders and the next Prime Minister commit to defending the people they have been elected to serve by working with other nations to establish a legally binding treaty to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. If the incoming leader does not support this treaty, Just Stop Oil will begin a new campaign of civil resistance, and they are not alone. In an unprecedented coordination across movements, citizen’s from Austria, Canada, Norway, UK, Netherlands and Switzerland have pledged to join in resistance this summer, if their own Governments do not take meaningful action.” This is the start of an International Uprising.

"12","Just Stop Oil letter to party leaders",2024-06-13,"Dear Party Leaders, It is now widely recognised that global temperatures have passed the Paris Agreement threshold of +1.5°C above pre-industrial levels with records showing a running average temperature rise of 1.61°C in the 12 months to April 2024. The consequences of this breach should be well known to anyone seeking political office in this country. The evidence continues to accumulate. Global heating, driven by fossil fuels, represents a grave and rising threat to human health, to food security, to our economy, to peace and security. Put simply, fossil fuels will kill people in their millions and destroy everything we hold dear. Faced with such an imminent threat, continuing to extract and burn fossil fuels is nothing short of an act of war against small island states and the poor living in the global south, an utter betrayal of the young and an act of treason against the United Kingdom. In light of this, if you are elected as the next Prime Minister, your first responsibility must be to ensure the robust defence of the people you have been elected to serve. It is crystal clear that the COP process has failed and we now need a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty – a concrete, globally binding plan to end all new coal, oil and gas projects and manage a fair and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. We therefore demand that, should you become our next Prime Minister, you immediately commit the UK government to work with other nations to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fair and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty. Failing to do so, would be both criminal and murderous. If you do not provide such assurance by 12 July 2024, we will be forced to take action to protect our communities by engaging in a campaign of noncooperation against fossil fuel use at airports across the country. The era of fossil fuels is over. It’s time to stop waging war on the young.

"13","Just Stop Oil supporters disrupt Duke of Westminster’s wedding",2024-06-07,"Just Stop Oil supporters disrupt Duke of Westminster’s wedding Two Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted the ‘society wedding of the year’ between the Duke of Westminster and Olivia Henson. The pair of Just Stop Oil supporters are taking action to demand an emergency plan to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. [1] At around 12:30 pm, two Just Stop Oil supporters used fire extinguishers to project powder paint near the entrance to Chester Cathedral, whilst billionaire aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor and his new wife Olivia Henson made their way towards a waiting luxury 8-Litre Bentley, after leaving their wedding service and standing for photos. Police quickly intervened and arrested the two ladies. One of those taking action today is Polly, 73, a care worker from Norfolk, who said: “Weddings are a time of coming together in celebration to make a commitment to the future. However, for countless millions around the world there is no future unless we come together to stop oil and gas. That’s why we are demanding that the next UK government work with other countries to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.” Also taking action today is Sheila, 69, from Bristol, who worked as an NHS nurse for 50 years. She said: “What do we value most? The wealth of billionaires like the Duke of Westminster OR the lives of the billions who are being destroyed by the fossil fuel industry? Extreme wealth and the climate crisis are both symptoms of a broken system that is not serving most ordinary people.” “I am asking my fellow citizens to peacefully, but determinedly, demand an emergency plan to stop the drilling and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. My grandchildren, all our children and all future generations’ lives are dependent on what we all do right now.” Today’s action comes off the back of the hottest May on record, completing 12 months in a row that have set a new global temperature record for that time of year. The average temperature last month was 1.52C above the pre-industrial average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Spiralling temperatures supercharged by fossil fuel burning, deforestation and animal agriculture are threatening to take the world past irreversible tipping points that will lead to vast swathes of the planet becoming uninhabitable, leading to mass displacement, famine and war. [2][3] Hugh Grosvenor is number 14th on the 2024 Sunday Times Rich List and is the UK’s richest man under 40, with an estimated fortune of £10.1bn of inherited wealth. He inherited his father’s fortune despite not being the eldest of his siblings, as male heirs take precedence over their older sisters when it comes to inheriting an estate. The property company he inherited, the Grosvenor Group, owns about 300 acres of land in Mayfair and Belgravia in central London, as well as major city centre developments such as Liverpool’s ONE shopping centre and properties in the US and Canada. Today’s wedding is being billed as one of the most prestigious social events of the year and is attended by Prince William amongst other royals. [4] This summer, Just Stop Oil supporters will be acting in solidarity with other groups internationally to defend our families and communities from the crimes of fossil capital and the political leaders who are facilitating the destruction of everything we care about.

[1] During the trial, Judge Sellers ruled that none of the defence’s three arguments would be allowed for the jury to consider. Despite this, the 12 member jury made a factual determination and found all three defendants not guilty. On 28 April 2022, Just Stop Oil supporters blocked the entrances to Clacket Lane Services on the M25 by sitting in the road with Just Stop Oil banners. They also decommissioned the petrol pumps by breaking the display glass and covering it with spray paint. This action was taken in support of their demand for the UK government to end all new oil and gas projects in the country. [2] Nathan McGovern, 24, one of the three acquitted today, spoke about the outcome. “Despite Attorney General rulings, despite losing every legal defence, despite the Conservative Party demonising those taking action to protect our communities from the crimes of oil companies – 12 ordinary members of the public have returned a resounding not guilty verdict. This is a clear sign that the British public sides with those taking action to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown, not BP or the Tory party. From a jury in the heart of England, this could not make it clearer where the public lies on the need to end fossil fuels and protect all life” Until leaders act to protect us, Just Stop Oil supporters will continue to take the proportional action necessary to generate political pressure.

"15","Victory at Royal Courts of Justice",2024-06-04,"A judge has ruled that Just Stop Oil supporters Callum Goode and Tez Burns will face no penalty or costs for allegedly breaching an injunction brought by National Highways Limited related to Just Stop Oil’s gantry actions in 2022. [1] Justice Soole made this decision today at the Royal Courts of Justice, where Callum Goode appeared in person. He concluded that their testimony about not knowing the injunction order at the time of their actions was genuine and that their conduct and testimonies were truthful throughout the hearings. The judge believed that the counsel for NHL failed to prove they had knowingly breached the injunction. Previously on March 6th, on the final day of the hearings for this matter, Callum and Tez staged a peaceful demonstration by glueing their hands to the gate of the Royal Courts of Justice. This action was aimed at highlighting how injunctions are being weaponized to silence those speaking out about climate inaction. Following their demonstration, Callum was remanded in prison, where they spent 41 days before being acquitted by District Judge Minhas at the City of London Magistrates’ Court on April 16th. [2] [3] Callum and Tez were charged with the offence of ‘locking-on’ under the Public Order Act, marking the first-ever trial in the country under this new legislation. The court dismissed this charge, with the judge ruling that a conviction would be disproportionate for a minor 15-minute delay to court proceedings. Having been acquitted in this criminal case brought against them earlier this year in the magistrates’ court and now found not liable to any penalties, Callum Goode said today: “Today’s decision shows that sometimes money can’t buy justice. I have been given no costs and no penalties. The judge understood that when we say we’ll tell the truth in court, we actually do, unlike private companies with no allegiance to the truth. I refused to sign an undertaking to comply with an unjust order and won’t ever promise to act against my conscience.” “We are facing the biggest crisis humanity has ever seen. The climate crisis is already uprooting lives around the world and will affect us all. We must keep pushing until the government stops the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030. If National Highways Limited really wants us to stop, they should make a case to the government to halt all new oil and gas licensing. That is the only way to stop people from taking action, given the magnitude of the crisis we face.” A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Injunctions are private laws bought by corporations and government agencies. Typically they are used to protect someone from harassment, and are intended as a remedy not a punishment, but since the Insulate Britain campaign began, they’ve been increasingly used by the State and private companies to silence dissent by climate resistors. They are being used to circumnavigate the usual rule of law, where defendants appear before a high court judge with no jury.” “They potentially expose defendants to ‘double jeopardy’ for the same action, where they may also be facing criminal charges. Typically injunctions result in astronomical legal costs which are applied to people named on an injunction, even if they have never broken it. Where defendants are offered an undertaking- which commits them to a certain action- and they choose to sign it, all costs are then divided equally amongst any remaining defendants. This is a divide and rule tactic being used to silence those speaking out about the criminality of politicians and business leaders.” In a recent Guardian survey, 77% of climate scientists confirmed expectations of global temperatures rising by at least 2.5C above pre industrial levels, significantly exceeding the critical 1.5C threshold governments agreed to in 2015. Almost half (42%) think it will be more than 3C. “[The climate crisis] is an existential threat to humanity and [lack of] political will and vested corporate interests are preventing us addressing it. I do worry about the future my children are inheriting,” said Lorraine Whitmarsh, environmental scientist at the University of Bath. When asked what individual action would be effective, Stephen Humphreys at the London School of Economics said: “Civil disobedience.” [4] Until leaders act to protect us, Just Stop Oil supporters will continue to take the proportional action necessary to generate political pressure.

"16","Just Stop Oil’s statement on Walney Report",2024-05-21,"The Government’s ‘independent adviser’ on domestic extremism, Lord Walney aka former Labour Politician John Woodcock, has issued a report calling for organisations like Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil to be banned. [1] The report outlines that any group engaging in action where the maximum penalty is imprisonment should be restricted through sanctions, including removing the right to assemble and fundraise. The report also calls for new measures that would enable individuals and businesses to sue protest groups, as well as calling for an extension of police spies and covert surveillance on groups the government disagrees with. [2] Last week, it emerged that far from being ‘independent’, Mr Woodcock serves vested corporate interests in the arms and fossil fuel industries, whose profits are being threatened by the groups he’s proposing to ban. Amongst other roles, Woodcock chairs the Purpose Defence Coalition, whose members include Leonardo, one of the world’s largest arms manufacturers, with extensive links to the Israeli government. He is also a paid adviser to Rud Pederson, lobbyists, whose clients include the oil and gas giant, Glencore as well as Enwell Energy, which describes itself as ‘a highly focused oil and gas business’. He is also a paid adviser to the Purpose Business Coalition, whose members include BP. [3] Woodcock resigned from the Labour party in 2018 amid sexual harassment allegations, and was subsequently granted a lifelong peerage by Boris Johnson after calling on the electorate to vote for the Conservatives. The report has been laid before the House of Commons using the ‘motion for unopposed return’ procedure, which means there’s no scrutiny of it by Parliament, but it benefits from Parliamentary privilege, ie: Walney can’t be sued for defamation. Shami Chakrabarti, a Labour peer and human rights advocate, said the government was hiding behind procedure. “It is ironic that a government that consistently attacks protesters by press releases and reading the riot act to police chiefs now hides behind arcane procedure and abuse of parliamentary privilege,” she said. [4] The revelations echo a previous attempt by the so-called ‘think-tank’, Policy Exchange to brand climate defenders as ‘extremists’ in 2019. It later emerged that Policy Exchange was also being funded by Big Oil. [5][6] A Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “Lord Walney is directly funded by oil and gas companies, as well as by the weapons manufacturers responsible for the deaths of countless innocent civilians in Gaza. His direct financial ties to the very companies whose profits are threatened by the groups he’s proposing to ban, means he is entirely compromised. It is yet another case of open corruption. As such, Just Stop Oil does not recognise the legitimacy of this report. The governments’ climate strategy has been declared unlawful for the second time and their response has been to licence yet more oil, as our climate spins out of control. Who are we going to sue for the inconvenience of flooded fields, crop failure, spiralling food costs and empty shelves? Just this morning, the High Court has ruled that Suella Braverman acted unlawfully in making it easier for the police to criminalise peaceful direct action. History will come to regard the acts of this government and its cronies as the real criminals, which is why they will stop at nothing to silence those telling the truth and acting like we are in the emergency that we are in.” Today’s report comes hours after the High Court ruled the Home Office’s threshold for “serious disruption” in the Public Order Act 2023 was unlawful.

"17","Just Stop Oil supporters convicted in first ever Section 7 Trial",2024-05-15,"Phoebe Plummer, Chiara Sarti, and Daniel Hall have been found guilty in a landmark case under Section 7 of the new Public Order Act 2023. The case concluded today with a jury decision of 11-1 at Southwark Crown Court. The Just Stop Oil supporters were tried for marching for twenty minutes to demand the UK government end all licences and consents for new oil, gas, and coal projects. They are due to have their sentencing hearing on the 3rd of July 2024. [1] Speaking on the final day of hearings, Phoebe, 22, said: “I am on trial for spending 20 minutes on a march. During the course of this trial we have had all our legal defences removed and been told that we can not talk about the climate crisis. So today when I was giving my closing statement, I decided to stand for a minute in silence to think about all of the people that are dying right now due to the government’s inaction on the climate crisis. “To be honest this trial really isn’t about me or my codefendants, it is about our democracy. If we can not march against injustices then I don’t think we can say we live in a democracy.” This trial marks the first prosecution under Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, which addresses acts “which prevent or significantly delay the operation of key infrastructure, including airports, railways, printing presses, and oil and gas infrastructure”. The offence can lead to a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. During the trial, significant restrictions were placed on the defence; the defendants were stripped of all legal defences and were prohibited from mentioning the climate crisis to the jury. The three took action on the 15th November 2023, marching for less than twenty minutes along Cromwell Road in London. Following their arrest for peacefully marching, Phoebe Plummer was imprisoned, without trial, for 18 days, whilst Chiara Sarti was imprisoned for 19 days, without trial. [2] [3] [4] Chiara Sarti, 24, a PhD student from Cambridge, spoke before trial: “We are on trial for daring to walk down a road for less than 20 minutes. They have already put us in prison over this for two weeks, using laws written by the Policy Exchange and paid for by big oil. On the prison TV we got to watch the lives of our friends in Uganda being sacrificed for the profits of oil barons at COP28.” In a recent Guardian survey, 77% of climate scientists confirmed expectations of global temperatures rising by at least 2.5C above pre industrial levels, significantly exceeding the critical 1.5C threshold governments agreed to in 2015.

She was arrested on October 14, 2022, for spraying the iconic, triangular Metropolitan Police sign with orange paint in front of New Scotland Yard during Just Stop Oil’s month of action. [1] Lora was among the 637 people detained by police during a period of relentless civil resistance that month, demanding that the government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents. A video of Lora’s arrest from two years ago on Westminster Bridge, where she proclaimed that “inaction on climate change is a death sentence for all,” has been viewed more than 11 million times. [2] Johnson said today: “I’ve just been found not guilty after six days at Southwark Crown Court by a jury of my peers. The action I took was painting the New Scotland Yard sign orange, in resistance to the government’s genocidal approval of new oil and gas licences. “I would like to ask the MET police: who are they there to serve and protect? The good people of this country? Or the oil-corrupted government? I would like to ask them how they are planning to police the mass hysteria, the panic, the fear, the looting, the theft, the hoarding and the inevitable violence that will result when our shelves are empty and we can’t feed our children?” There has been a spate of acquittals for Just Stop Oil supporters in the last few months, including yesterday at Stratford Magistrates Court where five supporters were found not guilty of Section 12 breach, and on May 8th when Fiona Atkinson and Catherine Rennie-Nash were found not guilty of Willful Obstruction of the Highway. Allied Swedish A22 group ‘Restore Wetlands’ have recently declared victory after their demands have been multilaterally adopted by all major parties in Swedish parliament, saying: “We will no longer glue ourselves to the highway with our Restore Wetlands banners. Restore Wetlands declare victory. Peaceful civil resistance works.” [3] Speaking after her widely-publicised action in 2022, Johnson had said: “Last week I said I am doing this for my son, that is still true. Today I want to say to those who arrested me, and others, for those who have imprisoned over 100 people acting to protect humanity that we are not prepared to watch while everything we love is destroyed. We’re done with begging. We are acting to stop new oil and gas because it is the right thing to do. “As a citizen, a mother, a daughter I have every right under British law to protect myself and those I love.This is the moment, we are the last people that can solve this.

They are demanding the UK government commit to an emergency plan to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. [1] At around 10:40am, Reverend Dr Sue Parfitt, 82, an active Anglican priest, author, and retired psychotherapist from Bristol, and Judy Bruce, 85, a retired biology teacher from Swansea, entered the British Library and smashed the glass enclosure that surrounds the Magna Carta- the ‘Great Charter’ that is an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament. The pair then glued themselves to the enclosure holding a sign which read ‘The government is breaking the law’, and could be heard saying: “Is the government above the law?” “The government has been found guilty of breaking its own climate laws! What do we value more? The lives of our children? Or new oil licences? It’s time to choose!” Judy Bruce said: “This week 400 respected scientists- contributors to IPCC reports, are saying we are ‘woefully unprepared’ for what’s coming: 2.5 or more degrees of heating above pre industrial levels.” “Instead of acting, our dysfunctional government is like the three monkeys: ‘see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing- pretend we’ve got 25 years’.. We haven’t! We must get off our addiction to oil and gas by 2030 – starting now.” Reverend Dr Sue Parfitt said: “The Magna Carta is rightly revered, being of great importance to our history, to our freedoms and to our laws. But there will be no freedom, no lawfulness, no rights, if we allow climate breakdown to become the catastrophe that is now threatened.” “We must get things in proportion. The abundance of life on earth, the climate stability that allows civilisation to continue is what must be revered and protected above all else, even above our most precious artefacts.” A Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “Clause 39 of the Magna Carta is one of four clauses still enshrined in UK common law, a so-called ‘golden passage’, that states: ‘No free man is to be arrested, or imprisoned, or in any other way ruined, except by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.” “Contrast that with civil law as it stands in 2024, where corporations are buying private laws in the form of injunctions that circumvent the people’s rights to a trial by jury for speaking out against the crimes of oil companies.” Today’s action comes the same week the government’s climate policy has been ruled unlawful for the second time by the UK high court. The court found there is not enough evidence that there are sufficient policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet its legally binding carbon budgets and its pledge to cut emissions by more than two-thirds by 2030, both of which the government is off track to meet. [2] Also this week, the North Sea Transition Authority, has just announced the offer of 31 new oil and gas licences under the 33rd oil and gas licensing round. [3] Meanwhile, a poll of hundreds of the world’s top climate scientists have expressed their ‘despair’ at the current trajectory, with 77% of respondents believing global temperatures will reach at least 2.5C above pre-industrial levels- a devastating degree of heating. Almost half (42%) think it will be more than 3C. “It is the biggest threat humanity has faced, with the potential to wreck our social fabric and way of life. It has the potential to kill millions, if not billions, through starvation, war over resources and displacement,” said James Renwick, at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. “None of us will be unaffected by the devastation.” When asked what individual action would be effective, Stephen Humphreys at the London School of Economics said: “Civil disobedience.” [4] [5] Democracy has been hijacked by corporations that are destroying our communities for profit.

"20","World Snooker Championships disruptors on trial",2024-05-10,"Two Just Stop Oi supporters, Margaret Reid and Eddie Whittingham, are appearing today before the Sheffield Magistrate’s court. The trial follows their disruption of the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre last April. They interrupted the championship to call on the government to stop all new UK fossil fuel projects and to encourage UK sporting institutions to join the fight against the government’s genocidal fossil fuel policies. [1] Margaret Reid, 53, a former museum professional from Kendal, Cumbria, is charged with attempting to cause criminal damage, whilst Eddie Whittingham, 26, faces a charge of criminal damage. On April 17, 2023, during a first-round match at the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre, Eddie climbed onto a snooker table and threw orange powder paint, disrupting the match. Margaret also attempted to carry out the action on another table but was intercepted by referee Olivier Marteel before she could begin. The pair, who earlier entered pleas of not guilty, were granted unconditional bail by District Judge Daniel Curtis in January. [2] Before the trial, Eddie Whittingham, a former student at Exeter University, and Margaret Reid shared their thoughts. Whittingham said: “It doesn’t matter what they do to us. They can arrest us, they can stick us in prison. But the world’s leading scientists have just said that we’re almost certainly going over 2.5C of global warming. This is a f**king catastrophe. Get on the streets and join us this summer as we take action at airports.” Margaret Reid expressed her unwavering resolve, stating: “I find it really daunting to face up to these massive institutions of power, but I will not be intimidated by whatever the justice system throws at me. Whatever the sentence is does not matter to me. What matters to me is stopping new oil and gas so we can prevent millions of deaths, the collapse of society, and the loss of everything we love.” “If we don’t stop the exploitation of new fossil fuels, then billions of people will face starvation, disease, and death. Earlier this week, a newspaper article quoted many of the world’s most respected climate scientists who were in utter despair over what more they could possibly do to provoke climate action from governments. I have far less power and influence than those scientists, but I won’t give up.” In a recent Guardian survey, a staggering 77% of climate scientists confirmed expectations of global temperatures rising by at least 2.5C above pre industrial levels, significantly exceeding the critical 1.5C threshold governments agreed to in 2015. An expert described the future as ‘infuriating, distressing, overwhelming,’ fearing the irreversible impact on global south populations. [3] Responding to the survey an official spokesperson for António Guterres, the UN secretary general said, “The battle to keep 1.5C alive will be won or lost in the 2020s – under the watch of political and industry leaders today. They need to realise we are on the verge of the abyss. The science is clear and so are the world’s scientists: the stakes for all humanity could not be higher.” [4] This week alone catastrophic floods in Brazil have displaced over 150,000 people, led to numerous deaths, and left many others missing.

They are the first to be prosecuted under Section 7 of the controversial new Public Order Act. The three took part in a twenty minute march, demanding the UK government commit to ending all licences and consents for new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] Phoebe Plummer, Chiara Sarti and Daniel Hall are appearing from today before Judge Hehir at Southwark Crown Court, in a trial that is expected to last five days. The trial is the first ever for breach of Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, which covers acts ‘which prevent or significantly delay the operation of key infrastructure, including airports, railways, printing presses and oil and gas infrastructure.’ This offence carries a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. The three took action on the 15th November 2023, marching for less than twenty minutes along Cromwell Road in London. Following their arrest for peacefully marching, Phoebe Plummer was imprisoned, without trial, for 18 days, whilst Chiara Sarti was imprisoned for 19 days, without trial. [2] [3] [4] Speaking before the proceedings Phoebe, 22, said: “I can’t really believe this trial is even happening. I was on a march for less than 20 minutes, which I have already spent 2 1/2 weeks in prison for, and now over a week of judges, lawyers and a jury’s time has to be wasted to decide if that’s a crime.” “Under Draconian new protest laws I stand on trial after spending under 20 minutes on a march. I’m terrified about the rapid erosion of our right to speak out about what is happening and what measures the government will take to silence people sounding the alarm bells on the climate crisis in order to protect corporate profits.” Chiara Sarti, 24, a PhD student from Cambridge, also spoke before trial: “We are on trial for daring to walk down a road for less than 20 minutes. They have already put us in prison over this for two weeks, using laws written by the Policy Exchange and bought for by big oil. We got to watch the lives of our friends in Uganda being sacrificed for the profits of oil barons at COP28 from the prison TV.” In 2023 Desmog revealed that the Policy Exchange, the conservative think tank behind the controversial new laws had received donations from oil giant Exxon Mobil and other high polluting industries.

"22","Swedish Just Stop Oil ally group ‘Restore Wetlands’ declare victory in huge win for civil resistance",2024-05-08,"A fellow member of A22, a global coalition of allied groups fighting climate collapse, Återställ Våtmarker or ‘Restore Wetlands’ has declared victory. Their two-year campaign of nonviolent civil resistance has led every party in the Swedish Parliament to stand behind their demand of restoring the country’s wetlands.  [1] [2]. In a press release they stated “We will no longer glue ourselves to the highway with our Restore Wetlands banners. Restore Wetlands declare victory. Peaceful civil resistance works.” “Through our campaign, we have put the issue of dried out wetlands at the top of the political agenda. The government has made wetland restoration a priority area in its climate policy. The climate minister herself mentions wetlands, electrification and carbon dioxide capture as top priorities. Because of the work we’ve been doing for two years, politicians have now been forced to take a stance on wetlands.” “We have shown that peaceful civil resistance is an effective way to change society and are now passing on the baton. We have sat on the highways and risked our lives. Now everyone knows that wetlands play a crucial role in drastically reducing CO2 emissions, that they replenish groundwater, prevent floods and are absolutely crucial in reducing the spread of forest fires. Now it is up to the politicians, the county administrations, and the landowners to put all the talented excavation contractors to work to implement the national crisis project Sweden needs to actually restore the wetlands.” [3] Since the campaign began Återställ Våtmarker has caused a media storm and brought attention to the wetlands to an estimated value of 848 million SEK, with a marketing value at almost one billion SEK! (Calculated using Meltwater). This media attention has educated the Swedish people about the climate impact of drained wetlands and subsequently created a massive public opinion for wetland restoration. 75% of the Swedish people now think it is important to restore wetlands. At the same time, there has been a big debate in Sweden, both in the media and among people, about the climate benefit of wetlands – 4,500 articles have been written about Restoring Wetlands both nationally and internationally. This massive public opinion shift has made all parties in parliament stand behind restoring wetlands, and this year the government has made wetland restoration one of their three prioritised points in their climate policy. Several newspapers claim that it’s because of the Restore Wetlands campaign that the politicians have now made wetland restoration a priority. Svenska Dagbladet wrote in their summary of the past week, March 15, “Their message has gone from incomprehensible to actual politics. Climate activism that has actually created change.” From now, the campaign will pivot to a focus on the carbon-intensive peat industry of Sweden – a niche fossil fuel more damaging even than coal, oil, or gas. This news comes as law firm Client Earth have won a case against the UK Government over their Net Zero strategy, with the judge ruling that “that the UK government’s climate strategy is not fit-for-purpose, and therefore breaches the UK Climate Change Act”.

"23","Three gantry climbers face potential 10 year sentence",2024-05-03,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters are being sentenced today, after being convicted of public nuisance. The three took action during the 40 degree heatwave in 2022, demanding the UK government halt all new fossil fuel licensing and consents. [1] Cressie Gethin, a 22-year-old music student from Hereford, along with co-defendants Emma Mani and Alexander Wilcox each face a potential custodial sentence of up to ten years. On 20th July 2022, five Just Stop Oil supporters scaled motorway gantries above the M25, just two days after the government’s net zero strategy was ruled unlawful, and a day after the UK experienced its highest recorded temperature of 40.3 degrees Celsius—a level previously considered impossible. [2] Emma Mani and Alexander Wilcox pleaded guilty to the charge of public nuisance. Cressie proceeded to trial, which commenced on 5th February 2024 at Isleworth Crown Court, presided over by Judge Duncan. During the trial, she was prevented from talking about her reasons for taking action and was denied any legal defence by the judge. The jury convicted Cressie Gethin by a majority verdict of ten to two. Renowned naturalist and television presenter Chris Packham provided testimony at the trial, where he emphasised on the universality of Cressie’s demand. “It’s not ‘her’ cause – it’s THE cause. I support the need to raise the alarm on the most serious issue that threatens life and threatens us,” he remarked. Packham had also expressed concerns about the fairness of the proceedings, stating, “I am attending court to support Cressie Gethin because I don’t think she is getting a fair trial. I think, along with the UN, that the UK’s protest laws and sentencing of protesters are unjust, draconian, and in conflict with our basic human rights. I think we are witnesses to disproportionate vindictive witch hunts hell-bent on punishing some of the bravest individuals in society just because they are forced to struggle to tell the truth. These trials are shameful, demeaning, and undemocratic. I set a challenge to the judge, the prosecution, and their witnesses… go home and tell someone you know: a son, daughter, nephew or niece who is under 25 what you have done today and then ask them if they are proud of you.” [3] [4] Trudi Warner, who recently had her charges of contempt dismissed by the High Court for displaying a placard advocating jury equity, had also been present at Cressie’s trial. Before today’s sentencing, she remarked, “It is very concerning that a thoughtful and principled young person, who should be entitled to a fair trial, was denied any legal defences. Her trial was run in such a way that the jury were not able to hear in full from her, or her chief witness, Chris Packham. Despite this, there were jurors unwilling to convict and who would not be swayed. One wonders what verdict the jury would have reached if they had been able to hear the whole truth.” [5] Speaking before her sentencing, Cressie said: “We are being betrayed by the actions of the UK government. While decision-makers kick the can down the road, while the cost of living rises and oil companies profit, while global heating spirals out of control; it falls on ordinary people to be the ones to say ‘enough is enough.’ Either we die quietly, or we stand up to fight for the human right to life. By licensing new oil and gas, the UK government is knowingly causing extreme suffering and mass death. Humanity is so much better than to let ourselves be driven to extinction by the elites – we can stand up and fight against that.” 61,000 excess deaths were recorded across Europe as a result of the extreme heat during the summer of 2022, whilst the UK government continued to licence new oil and gas.

"24","Cumbrian Just Stop Oil Supporters plaster climate criminal MP Mark Jenkinson’s office",2024-04-26,"Just Stop Oil supporters have targeted the offices of Conservative MP Mark Jenkinson in Maryport, Cumbria. Beginning at 7:35am today, four individuals plastered his officers with posters that read: [1] “Mark Jenkinson is telling giant porkies about coal & jobs. He just wants to please his Tory billionaire chums. The rich will get richer, the jobs won’t last & no-one needs the coal…” Cumbrians have previously staged disruptive action at Mark Jenkinson’s offices for his support of the Cumbrian Coal mine which received government approval in 2022. The government’s own climate adviser Lord Deben has described the project as “indefensible” warning that its approval would damage the UK’s leadership on the climate crisis, and “create another example of Britain saying one thing and doing another”.[2] [3] A group of around five more Just Stop Oil supporters joined the action takers outside the office, putting up ‘Crime Scene’ tape and holding up signs saying ‘PEOPLE vs COAL’. Mark Jenkinson arrived at 8:15am and began remonstrating with the action takers. Police officers from Cumbria Constabulary arrived on the scene shortly afterwards. The situation is still unfolding. One of those taking action today is Alison Parker, aged 41, is a constituent of Jenkinson’s from Aspatria. She said: “I am sick of Mark Jenkinson telling constituents like me that the coal mine is needed by the steel industry, and that it will be carbon neutral. We deserve to be told the truth. I’m really worried about the impact of the coal mine on the climate and how it will encourage other countries to build more mines too.” The action takers presented an open letter to Mark Jenkinson’s staff and police officers that details Mark Jenkinson’s actions that breach Article 30.2(b) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, calling for his arrest. It also cites “a group of Swiss women just won a landmark case against their government’s climate policies. This week, children in South Korea are in court accusing their government of failing to protect them.”  Attached to the letter was a detailed evidence dossier of Mark Jenkinsons’ actions which have lead to the supporters declaring: “In his climate denial, support for the ongoing use of fossil fuels and vocal support for the Cumbrian coalmine, Jenkinson is neither fulfilling his duty to his constituents, nor protecting local communities. Given evidence of climate breakdown all over the world, anyone who supports fossil fuel projects is complicit in crimes against humanity.” Another of those taking action today is Colin Benton, a 64 year old software engineer from Maryport. He said: “I’m from Maryport, and Mark Jenkinson is harming our town. He works for himself first, coal money second, and the people come last. Why won’t he protect our community? We’re sick of being lied to, we’re sick of crumbling public services, and we’re sick of corrupt leaders.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, our politicians, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"26","Les Mis disruptors on trial at Westminster Magistrates",2024-04-18,"Five Just Stop Oil supporters are on trial today for disrupting a West-End performance of Les Mis. The five took action on 4th October 2023 and were demanding that the UK government immediately halts all licensing and consents for new fossil fuel exploration and extraction. [1] Hanan Ameur, Poppy Bliss, Noah Crane, Lydia Gribbin, Hannah Taylor are appearing before District Judge Clarke at Westminster Magistrates Court today. The five supporters entered the stage last year during the performance of ‘Do You Hear The People Sing?’, carrying orange banners which read ‘Just Stop Oil’ and ‘The Show Can’t Go On’. They emerged during the song’s crescendo, amongst actors bearing revolutionary red flags. [2] One of those on trial today is Noah, 19, from Norfolk who said: “In October last year, four of my friends and I climbed onto the stage during a performance of Les Misérables and attached ourselves to the set, eventually forcing the rest of the show to be cancelled. I take complete responsibility for this action and everyone it affected. Despite this, I will be pleading not guilty to both charges held against me. The government and the corporations that control it, have created a situation where only with radical action can we hope to reduce the obscene consequences of the climate crisis. So, while I do feel a great deal of regret towards the performers, audience and staff, I refuse to admit that my actions were wrong. So I will continue to struggle for the right for everyone to live: at court today, on the streets, and at political events. Because there is no other choice.” Another of those appearing today is Hanan Ameur, 22, a student and hospitality worker from London who said: “We are at a critical point. It is clearer now more than ever that meaningful change is not only wanted but necessary. No new gas and oil. Do you hear the people sing?” Also on trial today is Hannah Taylor, 23, a community worker from Glasgow, who said: “There’s a high probability I will be convicted today for disrupting a performance of Les Mis; but what use is a play about revolution if we are not hearing the message? We are sitting by and watching our government sell-out our futures for oil money. It’s time for people to stand-up and, using whatever non-violent means necessary, demand that the government act to protect our communities from what is happening.” Today’s trial comes as record breaking extreme weather continues to disrupt lives and destroy crops around the world. Yesterday, ten inches of rain fell in Dubai in just 24 hours leading to mass flooding. Dr Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London said: “If humans continue to burn oil, gas and coal, the climate will continue to warm, rainfall will continue to get heavier, and people will continue to lose their lives in floods.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"27","Just Stop Oil supporter released from prison after acquittal in first trial under new ‘locking-on’ law",2024-04-18,"Just Stop Oil supporter, Callum Goode, has been released from HMP Wandsworth following their acquittal in the first ever trial for the offence of ‘Locking On,’ as defined in the new Public Order Act (Section 1). Callum has been imprisoned since the 6th March, without trial, after taking action to highlight the injustice of weaponizing civil injunctions against people demanding an end to oil and gas. [1] On Tuesday 16th April, Callum appeared alongside Tez Burns, 35, before District Judge Minhas at City of London Magistrates’ Court, charged with causing ‘significant disruption’ under the Public Order Act. On the 6th March, Callum and Tez glued their hands to the gate of the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight how injunctions are being used to silence those speaking out about climate inaction. [2] District Judge Minhas ruled that convicting Callum and Tez for a minor 15-minute delay to court proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice would be disproportionate. Goode has been imprisoned, on remand, since the 6th of March at HMP Pentonville and HMP Wandsworth. In their testimony to the court, Cal said: “The action that day was to raise the alarm around the use of civil injunctions to silence dissent. It’s a gross injustice and you can’t challenge injunctions legally because that requires financial means that we don’t have. So we’re forced to take this kind of action against these injustices to protect our rights.” “At the time we took this action I was on trial for breaking an injunction that I didn’t even know of at the time of allegedly breaking it. There were 18 of us participating in these proceedings of which 16 were forced to plead guilty because they wouldn’t be able to afford the costs of actually legally challenging the injunction. The choice presented was to either plead guilty or sign an undertaking. Tez and I refused to do that. We’d timed our action for the day of the verdict because we wanted to participate fully in the trial and tell the judge that this was unjust and give them the chance to realise that court time should not be wasted, but they didn’t do that.” Tez Burns, 35, a bicycle mechanic from Swansea said: “I wanted to highlight the injustice of the double jeopardy arising out of civil injunctions. Civil injunctions are private laws that allow extremely rich and powerful companies to suppress those speaking out against their murderous policies and practices. I think people have a right to know about injustice. Most people that saw us that day who spoke to us were kind to us. People weren’t pissed off, they were proud that their fellow citizens are standing up for something that is happening in this country that is wrong.” Michel Forst, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention recently said: “I am deeply troubled at the use of civil injunctions to ban protest in certain areas, including on public roadways.” adding: “The repression that environmental activists who use peaceful civil disobedience are currently facing in Europe is a major threat to democracy and human rights.” [3] A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Injunctions are private laws bought by corporations and government agencies. Typically they are used to protect someone from harassment, and are intended as a remedy not a punishment, but since the Insulate Britain campaign began, they’ve been increasingly used by the State and private companies to silence dissent by climate resistors. They are being used to circumnavigate the usual rule of law, where defendants appear before a high court judge with no jury. They potentially expose defendants to ‘double jeopardy’ for the same action, where they may also be facing criminal charges. Typically injunctions result in astronomical legal costs which are applied to people named on an injunction, even if they have never broken it. Where defendants are offered an undertaking- which commits them to a certain action- and they choose to sign it, all costs are then divided equally amongst any remaining defendants. This is a divide and rule tactic being used to silence those speaking out about the criminality of politicians and business leaders.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"28","Doctor who took action to protect her patients faces being struck-off",2024-04-15,"This week, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) will review the case of Dr. Sarah Benn, a 57-year-old former GP from Birmingham, to decide if she can maintain her licence to practise medicine. Dr. Benn, a Just Stop Oil supporter, faces this tribunal for her involvement in peaceful demonstrations demanding the government to bring an end to new fossil fuel projects. [1] This tribunal, which is sitting from today and scheduled for the rest of the week, will focus on Dr. Benn’s conduct in relation to her arrest at Kingsbury oil terminal, where she took action holding a sign on a grass verge which read ‘no new oil’. She was subsequently found to be in breach of a civil injunction, a private law bought by fossil fuel corporations, and was imprisoned for 31 days for this action. Dr. Benn informed the General Medical Council and her employer after each arrest and argues that her actions are consistent with medical ethics, which prioritise patient and public safety above all. This comes in a year when three GPs are under scrutiny for similar reasons, with Dr. Benn’s case being the first heard. Speaking before the commencement of these hearings, Dr. Benn expressed her motivations : “As a doctor, my fundamental duty is to protect health and life. This includes proactive efforts to prevent disease and death. The climate crisis is the most significant existential threat to global health we have ever faced. It’s disheartening to see governments worldwide declare climate emergencies, yet fail to act beyond these declarations. In medicine, when an emergency is declared, immediate action is expected—not just words. This is the essence of our job, and it’s often a daunting responsibility, but it is essential.” “This is why I felt compelled to address what I see as the most critical health crisis currently unfolding—one that is already causing widespread death, disease, and destruction globally and is set to worsen. We’re trained as doctors to intervene decisively to avert tragedy, therefore, this situation requires nothing less than decisive intervention.” “While initiatives like ‘greening the NHS’ are commendable and would have been a welcome start in the 1980s, today’s crisis demands more radical and immediate action. We are out of time, with only a narrow window remaining to prevent a total collapse of our systems.” “The protests and disruptions I’ve participated in are not actions I take lightly. I find no joy in causing inconvenience or distress. However, we must be clear about the magnitude of the crisis we face. The disruptions caused by peaceful protest are nothing compared to the catastrophic impacts of continuing to burn fossil fuels.” “I have been clear about my reasons for taking action from the very start. I will be sad and upset if I am removed from the register, but that will have no effect on my future plans. I will continue carrying out what I believe is my responsibility as long as the government refuses to commit to stopping oil and gas.” The GMC’s Good Medical Practice guidelines emphasise a doctor’s duty to justify the public’s trust in the profession. Dr. Benn believes that her continued advocacy and willingness to highlight the critical role of health professionals in addressing the climate crisis are in line with these principles. Recently UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders, Michel Forst, talked of his grave concern about the situation in the UK, and how such action against doctors might amount to ‘penalisation, persecution and harassment’. [2] He added: “I am deeply troubled at the use of civil injunctions to ban protest in certain areas, including on public roadways. The repression that environmental activists who use peaceful civil disobedience are currently facing in Europe is a major threat to democracy and human rights.”","https://juststopoil.org/2024/04/15/doctor-who-took-action-to-protect-her-patients-faces-being-struck-off/",2
"29","Just Stop Oil statement on Serious Disruption Prevention Orders",2024-04-05,"Just Stop Oil statement on Serious Disruption Prevention Orders A new legal instrument ‘Serious Disruption Prevention Orders’ (SDPOs) came into force today, 4th April 2024. Netpol calls them “essentially anti-protest banning orders that can prevent an individual from associating with particular people (including contacting them online), going to certain areas, attending protests, or encouraging others to protest.” [1] [2] A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said today: “SDPOs are an authoritarian measure to stifle democracy and free speech. They will have devastating effects on the freedoms to protest. They will license more surveillance and contradict human rights. They should be deeply worrying to people of all social and political positions.” “Individuals given an SDPO can be imprisoned, tracked, tagged, have their movements and associations restricted, blocked from using the internet, given unlimited fines… a free society does not do these things.” [3] Last month, UN Special Rapporteur Michael Forst remarked: “The repression that environmental activists who use peaceful civil disobedience are currently facing in Europe is a major threat to democracy and human rights.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, our politicians, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities. Until we stop Tory oil, supporters of Just Stop Oil will continue taking proportionate action to demand necessary change.

"30","Just Stop Oil co-founder faces unlimited prison time for Heathrow action",2024-04-05,"Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam will be sentenced today, alongside Dr Larch Maxey and Mike Lynch-White, for allegedly trying to shut down Heathrow Airport with small toy drones in September 2019. The three are appearing at Isleworth Crown Court from 2pm. The common law offence of public nuisance for which they will be sentenced carries a maximum unlimited prison sentence and Judge Martin Edmonds has said that all sentencing options are on the table. The action, by the Heathrow Pause campaign, aimed to stop Heathrow’s third runway due to its projected impact on climate breakdown, noise and air pollution. Roger Hallam (57) and Larch Maxey (51) were found guilty of conspiracy to cause public nuisance by a split jury which acquitted their co-defendant, former London Mayoral candidate Valerie Brown (71), on 15th December 2023. Mr. Lynch-White pleaded guilty in November 2023 whilst serving a 23 month prison sentence for disrupting the supply of weapons to Israel. Hallam and Maxey are appealing the verdict on the grounds of misdirection by the judge. Several independent lawyers have expressed their concern over the conduct of the trial and suggest they have a strong appeal with a good chance of success. [1] The campaign, which gained international headlines, praise from academics and journalists and helped stop Heathrow airport’s expansion plans, involved flying small toy drones at head height, within the airport’s 5km exclusion zone, but so far away from any planes that it posed no risk to aircraft. Supporters of the campaign used a loophole in the airport’s own rules, requiring it to suspend all flights under these circumstances. The purpose was to open a national debate upon the wisdom of Heathrow Airport’s proposed expansion, in light of the ongoing ecological disaster. There were a total of 20 toy drone flights within the 5km exclusion zone between 14-18 September 2019. Video footage of the flights was live streamed and provided to the police and airport authorities. A total of 24 people were arrested, some preemptively, although not all drone pilots were arrested, even when flying toy drones directly in front of the police and attempting to hand themselves in. [2] Heathrow Pause had communicated its detailed plans to Heathrow Airport and the police over a month in advance, to allow them to prepare. It held meetings with both, to share information and ensure that the action passed off entirely peacefully. In the weeks leading up to the action, Heathrow Airport claimed repeatedly that activists flying drones in the exclusion zone would put people’s lives at risk. In the event, it abandoned the protocols it had previously held up as being essential to passenger safety and continued flights as usual. In court, Airport Operations Manager Paul Farmer confirmed that the action had posed no risk to the public and had caused no disruption to air traffic. Hallam and Maxey are appealing the guilty verdict on the grounds that trial judge Martin Edmunds KC misdirected them, the jury and himself in law. Initially Judge Edmunds directed that, to get a guilty verdict, the prosecution had to prove that the defendants intended to shut Heathrow down but that this was in fact impossible. In giving their evidence and closing speeches, Hallam and Maxey, who represented themselves, therefore argued that, although it was highly unlikely, anything was possible. [3] In an unprecedented reversal, the judge then directed that, instead of proving impossibility, the prosecution now had to prove that it was possible that the airport might have been forced to shut down. Hallam and Maxey had effectively been duped into arguing the prosecution’s case for them. The barrister representing Brown, Michael Goold, who made his submissions after this, was able to do so on the basis of these altered goalposts and Brown was subsequently acquitted. The disparity in outcomes in this single trial mirrors those seen in other recent high profile cases. Juries have chosen to acquit some climate defenders while judges have handed down disproportionately lengthy prison sentences to others. The manipulation of legal process by Judge Edmunds in this case forced an otherwise reluctant jury into delivering his desired verdict. This comes as the UN recently condemned as unlawful the escalating repression of environmental defenders globally. [4][5][6] Roger Hallam commented: “Humankind is heading for indescribable suffering if we continue to put carbon emissions into the atmosphere. When I die, I want to know I haven’t lived a lie. I cannot pretend I don’t know what needs to happen. Thousands of people need to create mass economic disruption and go to prison in order to force governments to protect their people and enact legislation that will rapidly reduce carbon emissions. Going to prison, losing your job, losing your partner isn’t the end of the world. What is the end of the world, is the end of the world.” One of those who was sentenced today is Scientist Rebellion co-founder and former Theoretical Physics PhD student, Mike Lynch-White, who said: “The scientific community has a duty to be honest with the public. Yet in private, they freely admit that keeping warming to the 1.5c limit established at the 2015 Paris agreement is dead and we are out of time to avoid a climate catastrophe. The community says the truth will hinder climate action, but of course the complete opposite is true – only when the public is empowered with the truth will our response truly begin.” Tim Crosland, Lawyer and director of the climate justice charity Plan B, which supports climate and land defenders facing prosecution, said: “This is the first time I have witnessed a judge changing the legal goalposts after the defendants have given both their evidence and closing speeches. It is the first time I have ever heard of anything like this taking place. It is obviously a gross violation of natural justice and the right to a fair trial. It comes amid mounting evidence that, following a pattern of jury acquittals, some judges are manipulating the court process to engineer guilty verdicts for those exposing the government’s climate lies and hypocrisy.” The sentencing result is expected later this afternoon.","https://juststopoil.org/2024/04/05/just-stop-oil-co-founder-faces-unlimited-prison-time-for-heathrow-action/",1
"31","Just Stop Oil announce new corporate sponsorship deal with Gorilla Glue",2024-04-01,"Just Stop Oil has entered into partnership with Gorilla Glue- the American adhesive manufacturer. Just Stop Oil has been taking action since 2022, demanding that both Labour and Tories commit to revoking all oil, gas and coal licences granted since 2021 and formulate a plan for ending fossil fuel use by 2030. [1] The announcement comes as Just Stop Oil supporters are gearing up for their summer campaign, which will involve taking action at airports. Supporters of Just Stop Oil have also recently been disrupting both Labour and Tory politicians, demanding an end to oil and gas. Speaking about the deal, Mark Mercurio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gorilla Glue, said: “As an eco-conscious brand, we are extremely excited to announce this new partnership with Just Stop Oil. Our team is always looking for innovative ways to demonstrate the efficacy of our products, and we feel the opportunity to display Gorilla Glue’s robust adhesive range to the public in the context of Just Stop Oil’s disruptive actions, is simply a match made in heaven. From glueing to roads or government departments, our incredibly strong range of polyurethane epoxies will keep environmental defenders in place for longer.” A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “We are very excited to announce our new partnership with Gorilla Glue, who will be providing all adhesives used by the campaign going forward. Funding civil-resistance projects is always a challenge- being dependent primarily on small donations from the public, however we feel expanding our scope to incorporate support from select corporate sponsors will ensure the longevity of the campaign and enable us to keep pushing for an end to the oil and gas that is harming our communities. We see a strong unity of vision between Just Stop Oil and Gorilla Glue, both possessing a passion for effective adhesion as well as the colour orange. All Just Stop Oil banners will now feature Gorilla Glue’s logo and pending the success of this partnership, Just Stop Oil is investigating the possibility of other sponsorship deals, including with Dulux who have approached Just Stop Oil with a view to launching a signature emulsion.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, our politicians, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

The Just Stop Oil supporters are demanding that Labour, on gaining power, commit to revoking all Tory oil licences granted since 2021. [1] At around 8:30 pm, Ella Ward, 21, disrupted Ed Milliband’s speech. As she was forcibly removed from the event, she could be heard saying “Mr Milliband you must commit within six months of Labour coming into power to revoke the Tory oil and gas licences. New oil and gas means collapse. I’m a young person and my future is being completely destroyed, yet you continue to let the Tory oil and gas licences go ahead.” Explaining her action, Ella Ward, an environmental science student from Birmingham, said: “I’m disrupting this event today because I’m calling on the Labour Party to do the right thing and revoke the Tory’s oil licences. Labour has an absolute responsibility to take meaningful action to prevent the breakdown of our climate and society. Ed Miliband, Peter Mandelson and Louise Haigh need to accept their responsibility, do the right thing for their constituents and the people of this country by committing to using what leverage they have to cancel those licences. We will hold them to account until they do.” Greg Sculthorpe, 37, an accountant from Doncaster, was also forcibly ejected from the event. He said: “I’m taking action to demand Labour take responsibility for people’s security and livelihoods. They must revoke the Tory oil licences and invest in safe renewable energy.” Also taking action and removed from the event was Jane Touil, 58, from Rochdale, who said: “If we don’t stop burning oil and gas, we face collapse – crop failure, famine, more storms, flooding and fires. Law and order will break down along with all the public services we rely on, like the NHS. I’m desperate to prevent that. The situation is catastrophically urgent. Our politicians are either in the pockets of big oil companies or they haven’t got the guts to do what’s needed to protect our communities. So it’s up to us to demand that they do the right thing and stop all new oil and gas projects the Tories have green-lit since 2021. We need a new politics where what the people want REALLY counts.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, our politicians, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

This letter asks him to commit to leaving the Labour party if, within six months of forming government, they fail to revoke the Tory oil licences granted since 2021. Steve Race had sent a response which refused to commit to this pledge due to a stated commitment to a “Labour Party manifesto which will have been worked on and collated by many thousands of people from across the Labour Party and the Trade Union movement”. The Labour Party manifesto has not been seen by members of the public, and it’s not known whether it has been written yet. One of those taking action today was Jordan, 20, a psychology student at the University of Exeter. They said: “Today I’m fly-posting the Labour offices for Exeter. Last week I delivered a letter to Steve Race asking him to commit to resigning if Labour does not revoke the Tory oil licences within six months of being elected. He refused. This means that Exeter Labour will remain complicit in the murder that is going to be caused by the Tory oil licences.” “People are already dying because of the climate crisis. People in Libya last year were dying by the thousands, and this is only going to be made worse by Tory oil licences. We’re going to see the effects of it here in Exeter too. We’ve already seen the flooding that started, and the extreme weather events are only going to get worse. If Exeter Labour really cared about their constituents, they would have made a commitment to stopping Tory oil. We are here to keep them accountable, for the safety and health of their constituents and the world.”  Police officers attended the scene and spoke with the action takers but made no arrests. The action takers had a friendly discussion with a Labour staffer present who remarked “I completely agree with your right to protest”. As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"34","Just Stop Oil Essex tunnellers found guilty at Basildon Crown Court",2024-03-21,"Today in Basildon Crown Court, Just Stop Oil tunnellers Samuel Johnson, Larch Maxey, Joe Howlett, and Autumn Wharrie have been found guilty. The four are expecting to be sentenced in June. They took action in August 2022, demanding the UK government immediately halts all licensing and consents for new fossil fuel exploration and extraction. [1] The group took action by occupying tunnels dug under the road leading to the Navigator Oil Terminal in Thurrock, Essex. This occurred simultaneously with three other tunneling actions in Essex and Warwickshire, as well as occupations of oil trucks and terminals overground. These combined efforts massively impacted the flow and operation of oil in the UK at the time. [2] A sixth person, Xavier Trimmer-Gonzalez, took action with this group, but died in 2023 after spending time in prison following his actions with Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. A two minute silence was observed during the trial to show respect to his memory. [3] Sam Johnson, 42, said today: “I’m Sam, a construction worker from Essex and I took action simply because we have run out of time. We have known for longer than I’ve been alive what would happen if we kept burning fossil fuels – and now we are seeing this catastrophe unfold in real time. I have a nephew who is seven years old who I love to bits. As long as I have breath in my lungs I will fight to protect his future.” The group remained in the 52-foot tunnel for 13 days. At the time, Chief Constable of Essex Police, BJ Harrington, recognised in a statement that the climate crisis is a “serious concern”, however, Essex police put the lives of the action takers and motorists at risk by opening the roads over the tunnel. [4] [5] At the time, action taker Joe Howlett, 33, said: “The climate crisis is caused by a very small minority of people and it’s those same people who are currently profiteering from the cost of living crisis. That’s why I’ve spent the last 10 days living in a tunnel under a road leading to the Navigator oil terminal in Essex.”","https://juststopoil.org/2024/03/21/just-stop-oil-essex-tunnellers-found-guilty-at-basildon-crown-court/",1
"35","Multiple Just Stop Oil supporters arrested in surprise operation",2024-03-21,"Over the past 48 hours, two Just Stop Oil supporters have been unexpectedly held by the police for conspiracy to commit burglary. [1] Rosa Hicks, 29, from London, was walking home from a community event in Camden at around 9pm last night when a Metropolitan Police vehicle pulled up and she was forced into the van by six officers. She is still being held at Islington Police Station. [2] On Tuesday, Reverend Mark Coleman was arrested outside his home in Rochdale at around 5:15pm by plainclothes officers, and taken to Bury custody suite. At 9:26pm that day, PC Jonathan Fryer and Detective Constable Philip O’Connor from the Public Order Crime Unit at Lambeth interviewed Reverend Coleman. They described intelligence that they had gained from reading a Daily Mail article which claimed that Just Stop Oil supporters planned to occupy the homes and offices of MPs. They questioned him about his political activities. Reverend Coleman has made the following comment: [3] “Their line of questioning went like this: ‘Who are the other members of Just Stop Oil involved – is one of them Phoebe? Why did you stand for election in Rochdale? What does “occupy” mean? Do you intend to occupy? Does anyone intend to occupy? Do you intend to cause damage? Do you intend to intimidate? What types of criminal damage are you intending?’” “‘How did you do at the election? What agenda did you have for standing? What would you do had you won? Did you run on a no new oil ticket? What else were you going to do? Would you sit in a politician’s office? Would you occupy the Palace of Westminster legitimately and then illegitimately protest? Do you believe that this is democracy in action? Do you know that several members of Parliament have been killed? What do you think is a reasonable or likely outcome for MPs? Do you think that activities leading to the death of MPs is a reasonable strategy for JSO?’” “They said my bail conditions would prevent me attending the homes and offices of MPs or parliamentary candidates. A clerical error means my bail conditions only restrict me from attending their homes – which is not something I have ever done. But being instructed not to go to MPs offices or the offices of those standing for parliament rather excludes me from the democratic processes. It was a privilege to stand for parliament in the recent by-election. I have committed no crime – why am I being excluded from playing a part in the normal political life of the place where I live?”  On the morning of March 6th, Just Stop Oil supporter Phoebe Plummer, 22, was arrested by plainclothes officers in Vauxhall for ‘conspiracy to commit burglary.’ She was interviewed and held for a short time at Walworth Custody Suite before being released later that day. On March 14th, she and Rosa Hicks delivered a letter to the home of Emily Thornberry. The pair asked the police officer stationed outside: “We’re here to post a letter, is that OK?”, to which the police officer replied: “You can post the letter, yeah, I can’t stop you from posting a letter”. Afterwards Phoebe was arrested again, for breach of bail conditions she was given on March 6th.

"36","Just Stop Oil confront Emily Thornberry again",2024-03-19,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted a public event featuring Emily Thornberry, after she failed to respond to a letter delivered to her home last week. They are asking for her to commit to leaving the Labour party if, after six months of forming government, they have failed to revoke the Tory oil licences granted since 2021. [1] [2] As Thornberry was delivering her open remarks, the pair stood up to confront the Labour front-bencher and Shadow Attorney General for England and Wales. They threw orange confetti and addressed the assembly, remarking “We need you to make a commitment to revoke the Tory licences for oil and gas infrastructure which will lock us on to the worst pathways of global warming and climate catastrophe”, and “Labour needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Everyone else has clocked that new oil and gas means more floods, more fires, rising food prices… when are you going to get it?”. Members of the audience were repeatedly heard to say “hear, hear!” to these comments. After the action takers were escorted from the room, Emily Thornberry addressed the audience, saying: “I have had Just Stop Oil outside my house, I have had Gaza protests pretty much everywhere I go. I assumed it was Gaza then I saw the orange and thought ‘Oh, right! It’s Just Stop Oil’. The worst thing is that one becomes hardened to it… I’m happy to argue the issues, I’m not happy to be told I’m responsible for the murder of babies in Gaza, or I’m personally responsible for the boiling of the planet.” One of those taking action today was Genevieve Shanahan, 33, a university lecturer in Management and Sustainability. She said: “Today I’m approaching Emily Thornberry to implore her to stand up to fossil fuel extremists and use her influence within Labour to secure a commitment to cancel these licences. The Labour Party are poised to win the next general election, and rather than grabbing this opportunity to protect the British public from this violence they are instead – unbelievably – dropping their existing climate commitments.” “As a lecturer in sustainability, I need to practise what I teach. In my classroom we examine how permitting investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure would lock in economic incentives that will, according to all reasonable models, make climate collapse inevitable. If the Tories’ new oil and gas licences go ahead then that’s it – it’s game over for all of us.” On March 14th, Just Stop Oil supporter Phoebe Plummer was arrested after she and Rosa Hicks delivered a letter to the home of Emily Thornberry. This letter contained the same request that was put to Emily Thornberry today: that she commit to leaving the Labour party if, after six months of forming government, they have failed to revoke the Tory oil licences granted since 2021. [2] Casper from North London, 31, is an ex-Labour member who took action today, saying: “Emily Thornberry says it’s no time for cowardice on climate – except it’s her Labour Party who are so afraid of fossil fuel lobbyists they can’t commit to revoking the Tory oil licences that we know will accelerate climate breakdown. She and Labour have promised so much and gone back on it all — no wonder they’ve asked her to talk at a fraud conference!” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"37","Just Stop Oil supporters disrupt climate criminal MP",2024-03-15,"Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted Tory MP, Mark Jenkinson. They are demanding the UK government end all new oil, gas and coal projects licensed after 2021, and make a plan to stop oil use by 2030. [1] At around 11:45 a group of around ten Just Stop Oil supporters gathered outside Jenkinson’s office holding signs, some of which read: ‘The Future is Not in Coal or Tory Lies’, and ‘Don’t Listen to Jenkinson, Listen to the Science’. The supporters fastened a list of Mark Jenkinson’s crimes to his office windows which were swiftly removed by a staff member. Mark Jenkinson however refused to speak with the constituents. Jenkinson has been a vocal supporter of the Cumbrian Coal mine which received government approval in 2022. The government’s own climate adviser Lord Deben has described the project as “indefensible” warning that its approval would damage the UK’s leadership on the climate crisis, and “create another example of Britain saying one thing and doing another”. [2] One of those taking action today is Fiona Atkinson, 68, a retired teacher from Kendal, who said: “As a grandma I feel for all the parents and grandparents in Cumbria who don’t want this mine on their doorstep because they know the last thing any of us need right now is more filthy fossil fuels. Burning them kills eight million people a year and adds to the carbon that’s overheating our only home. Mark Jenkinson refuses to deal with the reality of climate breakdown even though it’s clearly happening everywhere including right here in Cumbria. A new coal mine is a crime against humanity and going all out for it makes him a climate criminal. As an MP he is required to act in the public interest – it’s time for him to realise that means no new coal.” Another taking action today is Margaret Reid, 53, a retail worker from Kendal, who said: “Mark Jenkinson is a climate criminal and climate crisis denier right here on our own doorstep in Cumbria. He’s consistently pursuing climate-wrecking policies which will bring misery to the very local communities that he’s meant to protect. I just can’t listen to his lies and bluster any longer – and we simply can’t afford to keep listening to people like him either, with climate breakdown happening all around us right now. It’s time to call him out on the consequences of his actions. We’re the sane ones here – he’s the dangerous extremist.” Chris McDonald, chief executive of the Materials Processing Institute, which serves as the UK’s national centre for steel research, said there was no demand from his industry for the West Cumbria mine. Stating “There isn’t anyone in the steel industry who’s calling for the mine”, he warned that “British Steel have said they cannot use the coal from this mine because the sulphur levels are too high.” [3] The government’s advisory Climate Change Committee (UKCCC) points out that 85% of the coal produced in Whitehaven is likely to be exported.

[1] This afternoon, Callum Goode, 24, has been denied bail at Westminster Magistrates Court. Callum has been imprisoned since 6th of March for taking peaceful action to resist climate breakdown and they will likely remain remanded in HMP Wandsworth until the 16th April. Callum took action with Tez Burns, 35, blocking the entrance to the Royal Courts of Justice. The pair took action to resist the use of civil injunctions which are being used to silence climate defenders. [2] Speaking in court, Callum said: “I’m being held in prison not because I present a harm to anyone or am a danger to society, but because I refuse to stop being in nonviolent civil resistance. Why not hold me there for the rest of my life? I’m not going to stop taking action. We are in an urgent crisis and I cannot morally respect bail conditions which prevent necessary action. I will essentially be serving, through remand, a custodial sentence for something that may not even result in a custodial sentence. This court does not care about morality, this court is blind and complicit in the face of genocide. I need to act on the side of life. So if you put me in prison, so be it. You will have stripped me of my power, but I know that there are other people who will fight on.” Michel Forst, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention recently said: “I am deeply troubled at the use of civil injunctions to ban protest in certain areas, including on public roadways.” adding: “The repression that environmental activists who use peaceful civil disobedience are currently facing in Europe is a major threat to democracy and human rights.” [3] A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Injunctions are private laws bought by corporations and government agencies. Typically they are used to protect someone from harassment, and are intended as a remedy not a punishment, but since the Insulate Britain campaign began, they’ve been increasingly used by the State and private companies to silence dissent by climate resistors. They are being used to circumnavigate the usual rule of law, where defendants appear before a high court judge with no jury. They potentially expose defendants to ‘double jeopardy’ for the same action, where they may also be facing criminal charges. Typically injunctions result in astronomical legal costs which are applied to people named on an injunction, even if they have never broken it. Where defendants are offered an undertaking- which commits them to a certain action- and they choose to sign it, all costs are then divided equally amongst any remaining defendants. This is a divide and rule tactic being used to silence those speaking out about the criminality of politicians and business leaders.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

We are asking those with power to speak up and make a stand against the continued drilling of new oil and gas that is endangering all of us.” One of those taking action was support worker Rosa Hicks, aged 28. Today she said: “I’m reaching out to Emily Thornbury because it is desperately important that our leaders understand the severity of the situation we find ourselves in, and that they act accordingly. In times of crisis, people of conscience must use whatever leverage they have to stand in the way of injustice. Emily has power and we are asking her to step up and use her position to protect her constituents by ensuring that Labour does the right thing by canceling all Tory licenses granted after 2021.” Recently, Just Stop Oil supporters have delivered similar letters to MPs across the country, including to the home of Keir Starmer and to Annaliese Dodds’ during a fundraising dinner. [3] Last month, UN Special Rapporteur Michael Forst remarked: “The repression that environmental activists who use peaceful civil disobedience are currently facing in Europe is a major threat to democracy and human rights.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, our politicians, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities. Until we stop Tory oil, supporters of Just Stop Oil will continue taking proportionate action to demand necessary change.

"40","Just Stop Oil supporters block the Royal Courts of Justice during injunction trial",2024-03-06,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have blocked the entrance to the Royal Courts of Justice. They are taking action to highlight the injustice of private injunctions being used to silence peaceful dissent in the UK, and are demanding the government end all new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] At around 10:10 am, Tez Burns, 35, and Callum Goode, 24, glued themselves to the entrance gates of the Royal Courts of Justice. Today’s action comes after eighteen Just Stop Oil supporters have appeared at the Royal Courts of Justice over the past two days, facing trial over an alleged breach of a civil injunction taken out by National Highways Ltd in 2022. Yesterday, eleven Just Stop Oil supporters signed an undertaking committing them to no further action. In addition, six Just Stop Oil supporters, who were previously named on an injunction taken out against Insulate Britain supporters, were not offered an undertaking. Five of these have accepted the breach and will be sentenced today. Both Callum and Tez have refused to accept the breach and have pushed for the case to be heard at trial, which is currently ongoing. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Injunctions are private laws bought by corporations and government agencies. Typically they are used to protect someone from harassment, and are intended as a remedy not a punishment, but since the Insulate Britain campaign began, they’ve been increasingly used by the State and private companies to silence dissent by climate resistors. They are being used to circumnavigate the usual rule of law, where defendants appear before a high court judge with no jury. They potentially expose defendants to ‘double jeopardy’ for the same action, where they may also be facing criminal charges. Typically injunctions result in astronomical legal costs which are applied to people named on an injunction, even if they have never broken it. Where defendants are offered an undertaking- which commits them to a certain action- and they choose to sign it, all costs are then divided equally amongst any remaining defendants. This is a divide and rule tactic being used to silence those speaking out about the criminality of politicians and business leaders.” Tez Burns, 35, a bicycle mechanic and astrophysics graduate from Swansea, said: “I’m likely to go to prison for doing something that is akin to sounding the alarm when the house is on fire. In that situation I’m not going to let a pile of paper stop me from getting the hell out of the house. We know A to B marches don’t work and we know the Police Crime and Sentencing bill has effectively outlawed effective protest. In this country our democratic system completely depends on the outlet of protest, look at suffragettes getting the vote for women, look at the origin of the weekend. All of that came about through civil disobedience. This is the Royal Courts of Justice. Sending me to prison for breaking an injunction is not just, and that is why I’m taking this action today.” Callum Goode 24, a maths graduate from Ashbourne, said: “I’m being taken to court for allegedly breaking a court order I wasn’t even aware of, granted just two days before I climbed a gantry over the M25 to demand an end to new oil and gas licences. Hidden away, a judge with no jury will be deciding what happens to me. I’ve already spent 11 weeks in prison without trial for the action I took that day and I will also face a criminal charge- this double jeopardy is obvious injustice. For this stand I’m likely to face tens of thousands of pounds in costs and potentially prison and I’m only one of hundreds facing the injustice of these injunctions. In court, I have told the truth as I have sworn to – that resisting a government that is knowingly taking actions that are killing countless people and risking hundreds of millions more lives, is the only moral option.” The use of injunctions to silence climate defenders has received international condemnation. Michel Forst, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention recently said: “I am deeply troubled at the use of civil injunctions to ban protest in certain areas, including on public roadways.” adding: “The repression that environmental activists who use peaceful civil disobedience are currently facing in Europe is a major threat to democracy and human rights.” “The environmental emergency that we are collectively facing, and that scientists have been documenting for decades, cannot be addressed if those raising the alarm and demanding action are criminalised for it. The only legitimate response to peaceful environmental activism and civil disobedience at this point is that the authorities, the media, and the public realise how essential it is for us all to listen to what environmental defenders have to say.” [2] As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"41","We need a Revolution. What’s the plan?",2024-03-03,"This system is fucked, politics is failing us, we need a revolution or we really do face rule by ‘the mob’. As we pass through 1.5C of heating to 2C and then the predicted 3C in the lifetime of many alive today, we will lose all we cherish and value. Our treasured landscapes, the rule of law, education, healthcare, pensions – and yes the people we love. We will not be able to feed ourselves and those who rule us do not care. Look at Gaza, this is what they are prepared to let happen. Genocide is now acceptable. In response, nonviolent civil resistance to a harmful state will continue, with coordinated, radical actions that reach out to new people and capture the attention of the world. Alongside this, a new political project will be set up. This will run local assemblies and will support and stand candidates to shape the electoral debate. A coordinating structure known as Umbrella, will support these projects and this will be the heart of our community of resistance. Just Stop Oil will continue to be the major focus until we win, but we have a new three part demand: No New Oil, Revoke Tory Licences and Just Stop Oil by 2030. In addition to disrupting high-profile cultural events and continuing our Stop Tory Oil campaign, focussing on MP’s and those in power, this summer Just Stop Oil will commence a campaign of high-level actions at sites of key importance to the fossil fuel industry – airports. In addition to Just Stop Oil, young people and students will be taking action in a new campaign that will demand an end to genocide – both in Palestine, and globally, from the continued drilling and burning of oil and gas. Umbrella will launch Assemble, a democracy project that will mobilise hundreds of people by running local assemblies on issues of concern to communities across the country and giving them pathways to action. The goal is to create a “People’s House” to parallel the House of Commons as the first step towards having permanent legally binding citizens assemblies- a democratic revolution. Umbrella will be the hub for fundraising, mobilisation and directing resources to a range of new campaigns and groups, including Robin Hood, a major new campaign based around a demand to properly fund our public services by taxing the richest in society. Each of these campaigns will share the values of nonviolence and accountability. The system is fucked. You know it, everyone knows it. Don’t just sit around and watch everything collapse. Build what comes next: a revolution in politics, economics – our entire way of life. It’s time to unfuck the system. We are going for it.

"42","Just Stop Oil supporters occupy insurance companies driving destruction",2024-03-01,"Just Stop Oil supporters have occupied an insurance building in coalition with Extinction Rebellion, as part of ‘Insure Our Futures.’ The groups are demanding insurers immediately stop insuring new and expanded coal, oil, and gas projects and the companies developing them. [1] [2] At around 12:00 today, 30 Just Stop Oil supporters began occupying The Colmore Building in Birmingham. The building is home to three insurance companies: Allianz, Chubb, and Zurich. Today’s action is in solidarity with Students Against EACOP, a Ugandan based campaign group who are resisting the construction of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline, a project that has wrought huge environmental destruction and mass displacement of people across the African Continent. [3] One cohort of action takers remained in the building’s lobby, holding placards with slogans including ‘JUST STOP INSURING OIL + GAS’, ‘SOLIDARITY WITH STUDENTS AGAINST EACOP’, and ‘INSURING FOSSIL FUELS COSTS LIVES’. Another group infiltrated the building, occupying the first floor. Police officers entered the building by 12:15, having already made some arrests. A number of officers barricaded the building to prevent further entry, as a large group of sympathetic demonstrators gathered outside. By 13:00, police officers had arrested three Just Stop Oil supporters. Allianz, Chubb and Zurich are all insuring new fossil fuel projects. Chubb have not ruled out insuring the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline and Zurich has not ruled out insuring the Cumbrian Coalmine. This morning in Bristol, a coalition of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion supporters climbed the roof of Tokio Marine in the early hours to occupy the roof of the insurance firm. Tokio Marine is a Japanese insurance multinational that have come under fire from faith groups and others for financially supporting the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). [4] [5] One of those taking action today is Xandra Gilchrist, 72 a retired social worker, who said: “I’m taking action today for my daughter and grandson as well as communities in East Africa which are being devastated by the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. It’s critical that all of us act responsibly to protect our communities, this includes insurance corporations. Without their backing, companies such as Total and Esso will need to think again about how they increase their profits by extracting fossil fuels and pushing global heating out of control. Cheap clean renewable energy sources urgently need backing and insuring too.” Another person taking action today is Greg Sculthorpe, 37, who works as an accountant. He said: “I’m taking action to protect my nephews and niece, to try to rescue a future for them and all the lives around the world that are threatened with needless destruction. The insurance industry is still investing in short term profits for dirty polluters, rather than the safety and wellbeing of ordinary people. They have immense power to change our dire situation. It’s high time they took responsibility for ensuring a safe world for all.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"43","Why are we visiting MP’s homes?",2024-02-26,"In the past week, there has been significant debate regarding the validity of visiting MP’s homes in order for constituents to communicate the urgency of humanity’s current situation. We value this wider discussion because ultimately no-one knows what the nonviolent response is to the very violent harm that is being imposed on all of us by this current system. The emergency that we are now firmly in the middle of, leaves us with no comfortable options about how to proceed. 2023 was the hottest year on record- by a significant margin. It was the first year that was entirely over the 1.5C degree limit that world leaders committed to staying below in 2015. The world has now had numerous stints hitting the 2 degree limit delineated as the maximum threshold for maintaining any sort of stable society. What this means for humanity in real terms is outside the boundaries of any of our understanding. Humans are not equipped to comprehend the magnitude of the disruption that we have set in motion, but in short, it means profound loss of life and the likely annihilation of everything we hold dear, unless we rapidly reorient ourselves and begin to deal with this problem. The question is: What do we do now? We do not have the answers, but we trust they will emerge out of wider discourse that is under way. For clarity, we feel it is important to reiterate our commitment to nonviolence. All Just Stop Oil supporters are trained in nonviolence as a prerequisite for taking action and we very carefully design actions based on the particular context and unique circumstances for each one. Always this is done with great care and consideration of the wellbeing of all involved. It is clear to everyone outside of Westminster that our current political system is failing all of us, and it is also clear that ordinary people have very limited means of enacting significant policy change. Despite over fifty years of traditional lobbying, nothing has worked. Historically, when power fails to respond to the will of the people, one of the few options citizens have left is to go directly to the people making the decisions. We have no choice but to take our message to the MP’s and to the power holders, because the nature of our predicament will leave no parts of our lives untouched. Our sense is that there is a need to call on MP’s in a way that is reflective of the totality of the climate threat, hence we need to go to where they live, work and play. Where Just Stop Oil supporters have visited MP’s homes in the past, it has looked very different to what certain media outlets have described in recent articles. For example, last year, we sang Christmas carols outside Keir Starmer’s house and sat peacefully outside of one of Rishi Sunaks’ many houses. We will continue to visit the homes of MPs, delivering letters, and sitting on the pavement for time-limited periods to demand an end to Tory oil. Climate breakdown will bring wreckage and suffering into every person’s home and lives indiscriminately. Nevertheless, we certainly do not intend to enter people’s homes and cause criminal damage as has been suggested. [1] It is important to acknowledge that we all deserve safety in our homes and that is why we are asking those who are making decisions that affect all of us, by enabling the continued drilling of new oil and gas, to end new oil and gas. It is because all of our families are in danger that we are taking this action. As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, our politicians, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities. Until we stop Tory oil, supporters of Just Stop Oil will continue taking proportionate action to demand necessary change.

"44","Student coalition disrupt Anneliese Dodds’ dinner",2024-02-23,"Just Stop Oil supporters have briefly disrupted a fundraising dinner held by Labour frontbencher Anneliese Dodds to deliver their request that Dodds commit to leaving the Labour party within six months, if Labour fails to cancel all Tory oil and gas licences granted after 2021. [1] Demonstrators from a coalition of groups including Just Stop Oil, Students vs Oil Oxford, Oxford Palestine Society, XR Youth Oxford, Oxford Climate Justice Campaign, and Actions Against War Crimes Oxford, gathered outside the restaurant NEF Istanbul on Cowley Road from 6:30pm. Ollie Sworder, 20, a student from Oxford was one of those taking action. He spoke up at the event, saying: “I’m here with Just Stop Oil demanding Labour commit to revoking Tory Oil Licences. Anneliese Dodds: your party is dropping climate commitments when we need them most. We need you to stand up and to push for Labour to Stop Tory Oil, or leave the party.” “Here in Oxford there’s been substantial flooding, and this is only going to get worse. People in your constituency are scared for their homes and families. My generation is scared of the climate collapse Tory oil is creating. Why won’t Labour protect us?” “We need you to commit to revoking Tory oil and gas licences, and if that fails, to step out of the Labour Party and become an Independent.” Also speaking up was Rosy Wilson, 19, a student and supporter of Oxford Against War Crimes. Together they delivered a letter to Anneliese Dodds with a list of demands including “For Labour to halt all new oil and gas licences, and revoke the ones granted by the Conservatives, including the Rosebank project.” [2] Present at the action was Irfan Mamun, 27 years old, a PhD student in Molecular Biology at Oxford University. Today he said: “As a scientist, it’s been horrifying seeing the UK government last year handing out new oil and gas licences when it was the hottest year on record. The consequences of the crisis that we are facing are terrifying. If we don’t end our exploration for new oil and gas immediately, and convince other countries to do the same, we are facing a catastrophe where millions will die. We have to take action now.” “I’m calling on my local MP Anneliese Dodd,s who is the chair of the Labour Party, to commit to stopping Tory oil within 6 months of being in power, or to stand down from the party. I hope she will do the right thing and represent the people of Oxford, the UK and beyond.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"45","Dartford Crossing bridge climber released on bail, however now faces threat of deportation",2024-02-19,"Marcus Decker, one of two men imprisoned for scaling the QE2 Dartford Crossing in October of 2022, has been released on bail, however now faces a potentially lengthy battle to avoid deportation. Marcus took action to demand that the UK government immediately halts all new licensing and consents for fossil fuel exploration and extraction. [1] After climbing 60 metres (200ft) up the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and releasing a Just Stop Oil banner, Marcus and fellow Just Stop Oil supporter Morgan Trowland remained on the bridge for almost 40 hours before being removed by police. [2] Marcus was imprisoned for 490 days as of Monday the 19th of February and has served the longest sentence ever for peaceful protest in British legal history. Marcus is a German citizen with leave to remain in the UK. However, he now faces automatic deportation and potentially a prolonged legal battle for him to remain in the country with his partner and two step-children. [3] On release from HMP Highpoint, Marcus addressed media outside with the following statement: “It’s been 490 days since I have not been in either handcuffs or behind barbed wire. Today, I’m overjoyed that I can finally embrace my love Holly and the children again, and go home with them. Unfortunately, that doesn’t necessarily mean I will be able to stay with them forever, as I’ve been released on immigration bail and so the deportation struggle continues, which is devastating. What a journey it has been since my friend Morgan and I climbed the cables of the Queen Elizabeth II bridge, in October 2022, when I followed my conscience to enact an entirely peaceful act, based on my informed understanding of the best available science, which details clearly the dire predicament we all find ourselves in. I chose to attempt to call for some ‘real justice’ as the remarkable Chris Packham recently put it to me so eloquently. I’m appalled and despairing that despite the crystal clear facts and frightening evidence of our systematic hurtling towards an unliveable world, and with already hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths every year, the governments of the world (very much including our own here in the UK) are continuing to throw more fossil fuels onto the fire by licensing new oil and gas, whilst delaying real climate action like insulating our homes and decarbonising the food sector. With tipping points in the climate system dangerously close and complete societal breakdown therefore on the horizon during my lifetime, it’s obvious that many more people will be taking action as our situation worsens. I myself will refrain from breaking the law and will concentrate on the campaign to stop me from being separated from my family yet again. I am distressed that my action above the Dartford crossing caused inconvenience and negatively affected many people on the day, and I do want to apologise for it. I have accepted my sentence in the knowledge that my actions were an attempt to minimise a much greater harm that is currently being imposed on our communities. I do however feel deportation would be a lifelong double punishment, not only for me but also for Holly and the children, something which I feel would be completely disproportionate. I’d like to thank those who stuck by me, everyone who has supported me directly and indirectly throughout my imprisonment, all those that make prison more bearable, and those that have written to me from around the globe. My gratitude goes out to all those in this country and around the world who continue to risk their liberty, or even their lives for a livable future. Of course, I’d also like to thank my family, most of all my dear Holly. Thank you very much.” A petition calling for Marcus to remain in the UK has attracted over 154,000 signatories and in January a letter signed by around 600 leading actors and musicians, including Bob Geldoff and Oliva Colman, was delivered to the Home Office calling for them to withdraw the deportation order issued to Marcus. [4][5][6] Marcus’s partner Holly commented on his release: “I would like to thank everyone who has supported me and Marcus over the last 16 months. It has been very challenging being separated for all this time but the constant love, encouragement and generosity we’ve received from so many has enabled us to stay strong throughout. I am forever in awe of Marcus, who even during the most difficult and cruel moments in prison, stayed calm and focused. His desire to help those around him at every stage never wavered and I believe he used his time inside as well as he possibly could, starting a choir for other prisoners, playing the piano for church services and helping run the chess club. Marcus has apologised to all those who were badly affected by being stuck in traffic on the days of his action and I can assure you that he is truly sorry for that. I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive and understand why his conscience led him to try and act on behalf of all those dying as a result of the climate crisis right now and for all our children who will ask us what we did to try and stop it.” Sign the petition calling on the Home office to cancel the deportation on Marcus here: https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-deportation-of-a-peaceful-climate-activist As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"46","Gantry climber, Cressie Gethin 22, found guilty",2024-02-19,"Just Stop Oil supporter and gantry climber, Cressie Gethin, has been found guilty. Cressie took action in July 2022, demanding the UK government immediately halts all licensing and consents for new fossil fuel exploration and extraction. [1] The trial began on the 5th February at Isleworth Crown Court, with Judge Duncan presiding. The jury has found Cressie guilty by a majority of ten to two. Cressie, 22, a music student from Hereford, will be sentenced on the 3rd of May with two others. They face a possible ten year custodial sentence. [2] During the trial Cressie was prevented from talking about her reasons for taking action and was denied any legal defence by the judge. The court heard a witness testimony from acclaimed naturalist and television presenter, Chris Packham, who commented that those taking action like Cressie “should be commended for sounding a vital alarm”. He added: “I am attending court to support Cressie Gethin because I don’t think she is getting a fair trial. I think, along with the UN, that the UK’s protest laws and sentencing of protesters are unjust, draconian, and in conflict with our basic human rights.” [3] [4] Cressie climbed a motorway gantry above the M25 on the 20th July 2022, two days after the governments’ net zero strategy was declared unlawful, and one day after the UK recorded its highest ever temperature of 40.3 degrees celsius, a milestone that scientists previously thought was impossible. 61,000 excess deaths were recorded across Europe as a result of the extreme heat that summer, whilst the UK government continued to licence new oil and gas. [5] Speaking before the action in 2022, Cressie said: “I am terrified by the extreme heat in the UK this week, knowing that this will only get worse as we continue to extract and burn more and more fossil fuels. This country has the technology and money to begin a just and rapid transition to renewable energy immediately, but our government refuses to do so. I feel it is my duty as a human being to demand change in a way that cannot be ignored. Thousands of people will die this week as a result of the extreme temperatures we are experiencing in the UK. We are in this situation because of increasing global temperatures caused by the emissions from burning fossil fuels. Against this backdrop, the UK government plans to open new oil and gas fields. I am dumbfounded by their negligence. I am thinking of the countless people across the country and abroad who are now experiencing illness and death as a result of the climate crisis. People are angry that our government is continuing down the path of destruction, and we will not simply stand by and let this happen.” A Just Stop Oil spokesperson commented: “It would be extremely convenient for everyone if the climate crisis could be removed from our lives by the ruling of a Judge. If we could imprison the wildfires, if we could arrest famines, or if we could legislate against the rising sea waters that will leave parts of Britain submerged, that would be a fantastic outcome – but the reality is that we can’t and rapid decarbonisation is the only way of preventing these horrifying outcomes. However, the judiciary – like the police – is proving to be an effective arm of the oil and gas industry, by silencing and imprisoning members of the public taking nonviolent action against climate collapse. Future generations will be disgusted by rulings such as this.” As the world passes tipping points that threaten the breakdown of ordered civilization, world leaders, captured by the interests of oil lobbyists and big business, are failing to protect our communities.

"47","Shifting sands and changing tides: sending The Rig to rehab",2024-02-19,"Saudi Arabia, the second largest producer of oil, has commissioned the retrofitting of a massive offshore oil rig. Not to extract crude, but to turn it into a theme park. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) is spending $5bn on this mega hotel in the Arabian Gulf which is being marketed as an ‘eco-experience’ for thrill seekers.  Obviously there’s a despicable joke at play here that the oil rig, which is ubiquitously associated with climate devastation, is being turned into a luxury holiday resort. While millions face the devastating consequences of climate change around the world, the mega-rich are turning the very infrastructure which is feeding that demise into a luxury commodity. In addition to this, real oil rigs are infamously terrible places. They are dangerous and highly flammable, exposing workers to toxic gasses and frequent accidents. Even when they are not horrifically dangerous, they are dire as far as working conditions go. The oil and gas industry works on a 24-hour schedule which means shifts are long, they are in isolated and precarious places, and workers often live in shared rooms with their colleagues for weeks at a time. The conditions are so terrible in fact that the industry is facing an issue of an aging workforce and has been bending over backwards to attract young workers. An article in Oil and Gas IQ states the industry suffers from a ‘perception problem’ because ‘oil and gas is not viewed as cool’ by Millennial and Gen Z workers, ‘who lack interest in this type of work’ due to a lingering ‘stigmatization of industrial work.’ At no point does Brent Kedzierski, the author and former Head of Learning Strategy and Innovation at Shell, stop to consider that this perception problem might be caused by oil rigs being associated with devastating climate breakdown rather than young people being workshy. Even if it wasn’t for their central role in the climate crisis, turning an oil rig into a luxury resort is a fundamentally odd thing to do because they are the opposite of comfort and luxury. Whilst their operation fuels the wealth of the mega-rich, this is not a place they would normally be found in. But the oil industry needs this. To understand why this is, it merits revisiting the ‘perception problem’ that has faced petro-states. Saudi Arabia has long been associated with a deeply conservative Islam, routine beheadings, forced amputations and flogging, and so on. On the other hand, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), though just as active in human rights violations, has been engaged in a successful state-level PR campaign since the 1970s. This has successfully made it at home within the respectable global elites. As a result the UAE is much more known for Dubai, the seemingly apolitical luxury metropolis which recently hosted COP28, than it is for autocratic rule, slavery regime, and regular executions of foreign workers. In a similar vein, Saudi Arabia is engaging in a state-level project to clean up its image and it is doing this through technologically advanced mega-projects. “The Rig” is one. But the arsenal of the Saudi Public Investment Fund is diverse and well-stocked. Neom is the largest of these projects, having benefited from $500bn investment from PIF. It encompasses a series of mega-projects such as The Line, a ‘cognitive’ city that is set to guarantee ‘a perfect climate all year round’. Neom has been busy presenting The Line as an environmental solution to urbanism. From event sponsorships at COP27 to billboard adverts in Stratford Westfield, Neom has become synonymous with Saudi technological innovation. For all of its high-production renders, this surveillance nightmare in the making hasn’t got off to a good start. In addition to Neom’s environmental claims being dubious, the mega city has been most famous for displacing the Huwaitat tribe from the area which it claimed to be ‘virgin land’. Saudi security forces have killed a protester and in 2022 three men who protested the displacement were convicted of terrorism and sentenced to the death penalty. The Public Investment Fund, which contains within it other projects such as Trojena, a “sustainable” ski resort in the desert, is part of a wider directive led by the Saudi ruling elite which is titled ‘Vision 2030.’ This vision sets out the pathways for diversifying the Saudi economy, ensuring that the leadership ‘will not allow [their] country ever to be at the mercy of commodity process volatility or external markets.’ The climate crisis once threatened to put the capitalist extractivist logic that rules the modern world into question because it exposes that the fossil-fuelled rampant growth mindset is only capable of destroying the earth and decimating humans and non-humans in its wake. However, it has long been the business of the mega rich and venture capitalists to turn existential climate catastrophe into a business opportunity. The Rig, NEOM, and other techno-utopian projects enacted are part of this depraved project which turns the crisis into something to be mined for gain. But can Saudi Arabia’s mega-projects be viewed otherwise? In the world of investment, diversifying your portfolio is one of the most important things to do. This is the practice of spreading your investments so you are not reliant on one income stream. This is good business because any one income stream could fall victim to a volatile market, leaving you vulnerable and cashless. The mono-stream of oil has been fruitful and constant for many petro-states so far but Saudi Arabia’s recent ventures clearly show that there are seeds of doubt in the continuity of this monopoly. Like the UAE before it, Saudi Arabia can be seen to be engaged in an image cleansing project in order to amend its oily reputation. Turning an oil rig into a theme park seems like a villainous joke at a time when so many people around the world are calling for a total halt of all fossil fuel exploration. However, it is actually a desperate attempt to normalise the oil rig and oil infrastructure and integrate it within the less volatile leisure industry. The fact that the second largest oil producer in the world is doubting its main income stream shows that the tides are shifting for oil and that its future is not as secure as it once was. Thus, The Rig is an attempt to cleanse and normalise the image of this world destroying infrastructure and introduce it into the world of tourism and leisure. It is a villainous joke but it is also a sign that the long reign of oil monopolies is crumbling. Marina Ionita is a writer from London.

Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"48","TRIAL UPDATE: Chris Packham’s moving witness testimony in Just Stop Oil crown court case",2024-02-14,"Today, BBC TV presenter and respected naturalist Chris Packham testified at the crown court trial of Just Stop Oil supporter, Cressie Gethin. Cressie was also able to make remarks in her defence, and her comments are at the end of this press release. [1] [2] [3] In front of the jury, Chris made the following testimony: DEFENCE CROSS EXAMINATION Cressie: Could you tell the Jury about your background? Chris Packham: I am a man that loves life. Everything that slithers and crawls and swims. For the first 3rd of life I investigated everything – I had a profound interest in the natural living world and biology. The second 2 thirds of my life have been given over to a very real need to conserve our life. We have lost 70 percent of world’s wildlife in my lifetime. This destruction is having an impact on human life too… *Prosecution and Judge – interrupt* Judge: You are venturing into the unnecessary Cressie: Where were you on the morning of 20th July 2022? Chris Packham: On a journey from New Hampshire to Surrey – I was working on a BBC TV programme ‘Inside Autistic Minds’. I was going to a school to conduct interviews. Cressie: Were you delayed by the M25 closures? Chris Packham: Yes, the M25 and the M4 and other roads where people had left – I was routinely inconvenienced using the UK public road networks. Cressie: How long were you delayed for? Chris Packham: 4 / 5 hours. Cressie: What was your experience that day? Chris Packham: Like any delay I would experience – I frequently experience delays. We tried to pick a route that would avoid the congestion but kept getting stuck. Eventually we got off the M25 and I arrived 4 / 5 hours late – the congestion is as it always is – slow, moving to a standstill. Cressie: Do you remember your colleagues’ reactions? Chris Packham: I communicated with them over the phone. I kept them abreast to the delays . They were understanding and sympathetic to the reasons for the delay… *Prosecution interrupts* – Prosecution: It’s what you experienced, not what others did. Cressie: Have you ever experienced another delay of this length? Chris Packham: Frequently – the M25 was built in the 80s or 90s – it’s known as a parking lot. As we speak I bet people are sitting on the M25 now. Judge: Why didn’t you leave 4 hours early today then? Chris Packham: I left last night. Cressie: While delayed – what were you feeling? Chris Packham: I was brought up to arrive on time. It’s a necessity in my work. For cost and function. I always feel pressured to be on time. Knowing I was going to be late initially caused me concern. Initially I was frustrated and then I researched and discovered the reason was that protestors were acting on the A25. Then I changed my thinking. Rather than seeing a problem I saw an opportunity. I had time to reflect on their motives. I thought about whether the action was productive, what it was doing, to reflect on the fact that I was unable to use the Rail Network. The Rail Network, in the extreme heat, was issuing warnings not to use trains. I reflected on the fact that I was sweating – it was the day after the UK had recorded its highest temperature, just 2 days before the Government’s ‘Net Zero’ plan was declared illegal. I thought about their intent. I sympathised with them. Rather than sit and eat and fret – I ran through the process, and that made the experience positive. Others should do the same. The delay was not unusual – it could have been caused by many factors – for instance the fragility of our traffic system… Cressie: Would you say that it amounted to serious inconvenience? Chris Packham: inconvenience is a relative thing. Compared to high temperatures, the Government and the Met office were… *Prosecution interrupts* No, I’m sorry – the witness asked, “Were you seriously inconvenienced?” Chris Packham: I was as seriously inconvenienced as those people who are in unbearable conditions in other parts of the word… **OBJECTION ** Judge: You were a member of the public – you were inconvenienced – would you class it as serious? Chris Packham: not compared to the serious disruption I may inconvenience in future. Judge: Were you seriously inconvenienced? Chris Packham: No, I was not. Cressie: Did you experience financial loss? Chris Packham: No, I didn’t. ___ PROSECUTION CROSS EXAMINATION Prosecution: you are not an independent witness are you? Chris Packham: I support some of what Just Stop Oil does. Prosecution: JSO loves having you as a supporter, don’t they? Chris Packham: I do the same for the RSPB and others. I selectively support things that they do and I support other environmental groups too. Prosecution: You made a TV Statement saying “it’s time to break the law” didn’t you? Do you agree it’s time to break the law by closing the M25? Chris Packham: I think it was necessary for those protesters at that point to use peaceful means to raise an alarm. Prosecution: You don’t know about the traffic jams at J14 and J15 as you avoided them didn’t you? Therefore you can’t comment how much traffic there was at these junctions. Chris Packham: My research showed that the traffic was at a stand still. I avoided that and then joined after. Prosecution: have you seen the drone footage ? Chris Packham: No. Prosecution: It was the day after the hottest day ever – and it was hot and uncomfortable in the car. Chris Packham: As it is on many occasions. Prosecution: Please do your best to answer the questions. It would cause serious annoyance and distress – I’m asking you to think about all those other people in their cars and lorries and their vans. Chris Packham: I did, but I also thought about what it would be like for people for whom it was much hotter. Prosecution: 26 flights were cancelled. Chris Packham: As I recall Heathrow was under stress and it had already capped the amount of flights that could leave. Prosecution: There were over 3000 people impacted, 26 flights delayed and 19 flights cancelled. Do you agree that these people were seriously inconvenienced and seriously annoyed? Chris Packham: I don’t. It would be difficult for you to apply all of this to Cressie Gethin. Prosecution: [something about “her” cause] Chris Packham: It’s not “her” cause – it’s the cause. Chris Packham: I support the need to raise the alarm on the most serious issue that threatens life and threatens us. Judge: There was a documentary called, ‘is it time to break the law?” this was a question not a statement was it not Mr Packahm? Chris Packham: It was programmed by C4 and it would have gone against all the reg guidance Judge: had it not been a JSO protest – if it was for some other cause? Would you have felt differently about it? Chris Packham: In that context – I would have been principally concerned with the fragility of the network and the fact that I could not take public transport. The fact that it was about climate enabled me to reflect. ___ Earlier, Cressie gave her evidence to the Jury. This went as follows: On 20th July 2022, I climbed up onto a gantry over the M25. I hung up two banners – one said ‘Just Stop Oil’ (the campaign in whose name I was taking action) and the other said ‘40 Degrees”’ (this was a day after the 40C heatwave scorched the UK, burnt down houses and left people dead). The prosecution have said that my intention was clearly to stop the traffic. However, it is under oath that I say I was not expecting the police to close the entire motorway. I thought it was possible they may decide to close one or two lanes, or perhaps slow the speed of the traffic, but I was very surprised when they closed the whole thing. I was surprised because I was conducting a nonviolent, peaceful protest, the intention of which was to gain media attention and create public pressure on the government to stop new oil and gas. When the police did close the motorway, I did not immediately come down – you saw that in the footage. As I said, my intention was to get media attention and I realised that the road closure would be attracting more press coverage and therefore more pressure on the government to take steps to protect its own citizens. I will also address the matter of delays at Heathrow. Whilst this may sound unbelievable, I did not realise that the stretch of motorway I was on led to Heathrow – as I say, this may sound ridiculous, but I am telling the truth under oath. Because I am bound to the truth, I will also say that, despite not being aware of the location at the time, I do not think that near Heathrow was an inappropriate place to conduct this protest, given that it was there that 40.2C was first recorded the day before, and because of the relevance of air travel to the message I was trying to get heard. The 20th July was deliberately chosen to be when the temperature was less dangerous and the Met Office’s extreme heat warnings had been lifted. This was in order to remove any risks linked to heat and dehydration for myself and for any members of the public who were in their cars for longer than anticipated. I also took safety precautions that minimised any risk to myself or to drivers on the motorway. I ensured that there was at least one point of attachment between the gantry structure and the banners at all times. I also wore a safety harness so that I was attached to the gantry at all times. This gantry was enclosed and felt safe (it is designed for human access and is essentially a footbridge with enclosed sides) – but I took this precaution to make sure I was being as safe and conscientious as possible. I want to make it clear that in no way did I feel a sense of glee or “yes, I’ve won” when the police closed the road. I understood that by closing the road the police would be having to manage traffic that would have otherwise come down that stretch of the motorway, and that didn’t and doesn’t sit easy with me. The reason I didn’t come down goes back to my original intention to get the attention of the media and public, and ultimately, to address rather than ignore injustice and suffering. There was a moral dilemma involved in taking this action. I knew there was a possibility that the action would impact some people – that is the nature of visible and attention-grabbing protest. I had to weigh this, which doesn’t sit easy with me, against my sincere desire to protect lives. As I said at the beginning, my overall intentions were and still are to create pressure on the government to writing policies that are killing people around the world. The trial is ongoing. Updates will continue to be published by Just Stop Oil. Just Stop Oil supporters are refusing to allow the breakdown of ordered society and a collapse of the rule of law as a result of the selfish actions of a few. The people of the UK have had enough of the corruption and lies of those running the country and are stepping into civil resistance in order to save our communities from the worst of climate breakdown. It is not a case of ‘if’ we will win, but ‘when.’","https://juststopoil.org/2024/02/14/trial-update-chris-packhams-moving-witness-testimony-in-just-stop-oil-crown-court-case/",1
"49","Chris Packham is surprise trial witness for Just Stop Oil supporter facing a ten year sentence",2024-02-14,"BBC TV presenter and respected naturalist, Chris Packham, is testifying today at the crown court trial of Just Stop Oil supporter, Cressie Gethin. He has released a statement offering support for Cressie’s actions. Today, Wednesday 14th February, marks the eighth day of Cressie’s trial for Public Nuisance. She is appearing at Isleworth Crown Court, appearing before Judge Duncan. Cressie, 22, a music student from Hereford, faces up to ten years custodial sentence if found guilty. Cressie climbed a motorway gantry above the M25 on the 20th July 2022, two days after the governments’ net zero strategy was declared unlawful, and one day after the UK recorded it’s highest ever temperature of 40.3 degrees celsius, a milestone that scientists previously thought was impossible. [1] [2] Before entering Isleworth crown court, Packham spoke to members of the media. He made this remark today: “Because of Cressie, and other Just Stop Oil protesters, I sat sweating on the M25. Was I inconvenienced? Well, that’s a relative value. I was late to work, but my house was not burning down. I wasn’t drowning in a flood, displaced by famine, or separated from my family as a climate refugee. I was just sat on the M25, a position that I and millions of others find themselves in every single day of the year. Not because of protesters, but because our traffic system is broken, overloaded or stalled due to a breakdown or tragic accident.” “So I used my ‘inconvenience’ for good… I imagined the motives of the protesters, why they were taking such a physical risk and further risking imprisonment. I imagined how scared they must have been hanging onto a gantry. I also thought about their message and how in a record breaking heat wave – with our government’s Net Zero policy not fit for purpose – they should be commended for sounding a vital alarm. I reconciled that my ‘inconvenience’ was entirely justified.” “I am attending court to support Cressie Gethin because I don’t think she is getting a fair trial. I think, along with the UN, that the UK’s protest laws and sentencing of protesters are unjust, draconian, and in conflict with our basic human rights. I think we are witnesses to disproportionate vindictive witch hunts hell-bent on punishing some of the bravest individuals in society just because they are forced to struggle to tell the truth. These trials are shameful, demeaning, and undemocratic. I set a challenge to the judge, the prosecution, and their witnesses… go home and tell someone you know: a son, daughter, nephew or niece who is under 25 what you have done today and then ask them if they are proud of you’”. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson commented: “Chris Packham was personally disrupted by this action, however he is advocating for Cressie today because he recognises the fundamental truth that short-term traffic disruption is nothing when compared to the level of disruption that will be imposed on all of us as a result of the ongoing collapse of our life support systems.” “The courts can try to silence people like Cressie, but as the magnitude of our predicament becomes clearer, many more ordinary people will take matters into their own hands to try to prevent a much greater harm. It is clear that new oil and gas means societal collapse, and if Labour or the Conservatives prioritise corrupt scheming over our lives, then they can expect mass noncompliance.” The trial is ongoing. Updates will continue to be published by Just Stop Oil. Just Stop Oil supporters are refusing to allow the breakdown of ordered society and a collapse of the rule of law as a result of the selfish actions of a few. The people of the UK have had enough of the corruption and lies of those running the country and are stepping into civil resistance in order to save our communities from the worst of climate breakdown.

"50","Three trials of people who took action to defend lives to being next week",2024-02-12,"Press Release 12th February 8AM For immediate releaseTHREE TRIALS OF PEOPLE WHO TOOK ACTION TO DEFEND LIVES TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK We are witnessing genocide and societal collapse in Palestine and the UK government, alongside other powerful western governments are complicit in it. It has been reported that, similar to the 2003 invasion of Iraq led by Britain and US, that a motivating force behind Israeli military operation in Gaza is fossil fuel expansion. [1][2]Last week it was revealed that the ‘safe’ limit for global heating has been breached for a whole year for the first time. Millions of people, including those in Britain, face death, displacement and disaster on an unprecedented scale. It is now indisputable that halting fossil fuel expansions needs to happen. [3][4]On Monday 19th February three trials are due to begin of people involved in three different acts of nonviolent direct action to stop new fossil fuel expansion and protect lives.The three trials are: Extinction Rebellion JPMorgan Emergency Break Glass – five women charged with Criminal Damage for breaking glass at JPMorgan’s European HQ, September 2021 Insulate Britain M25 – eight Insulate Britain supporters charged with Public Nuisance for peacefully stopping traffic on the M25 motorway, September 2021 Just Stop Oil Tunnels Campaign – five Just Stop Oil supporters charged with Conspiracy to cause a Public Nuisance for occupying tunnels close to Grays Oil Terminal, August 2022.These trials also come amidst fresh attempts by the UK Government to undermine trials by jury and increase the punishments given to people taking part in nonviolent civil resistance. On 21st February the Court of Appeal will consider whether the last remaining legal defence of ‘belief in consent’, should continue to be available to defendants in nonviolent direct action cases involving damage to property. The Attorney General announced last year that due to the high number of recent acquittals by juries in these cases, they had asked the Court of Appeal to undertake a review. [5][6]Due to the coinciding of the JPMorgan Emergency Break Glass trial and the Court of Appeal review, it is possible that the group on trial in front of Judge Reid could be the last defendants allowed to run ‘belief in consent’ as a legal defence. As a result, more and more defendants of principle could find themselves in court, with no legal defence and prevented from explaining their motivations to a jury of their peers.Extinction Rebellion co-founder Dr Gail Bradbrook has already been denied the use of this defence and was therefore left without any legal defence in her trial last November for breaking a window at the Department for Transport. [7]Judges who deny people acting from their conscience the opportunity to defend themselves in court have been causing alarm both nationally and internationally [8].Last month, in a report commissioned and released by the United Nations (UN), Special Rapporteur, Michel Forst, said; “It is very difficult to understand what could justify denying the jury the opportunity to hear the reason for the defendant’s action, and how a jury could reach a properly informed decision without hearing it, in particular at the time of environmental defenders’ peaceful but ever more urgent calls for the government to take pressing action for the climate.” Further details about each case below.Extinction Rebellion JPM Emergency Break GlassFive women from Extinction Rebellion (XR) will be on trial for breaking glass at JPMorgan’s European HQ in London Blackfriars on 1st September 2021. [9]JPMorgan remains the largest funder of fossil fuel expansion in the world since the Paris Agreement in 2016. [10]Of the eight people who undertook this direct action, only five have been summoned to answer charges of Criminal Damage to the value of £330,000. The trial will be in front of Judge Reid at Inner London Crown Court and is scheduled for seven days. Two of the defendants will be self-representing in court.Judge Reid sentenced one of the defendants, Amy Pritchard, alongside two others, to prison last year for breaching his ruling not to mention the phrases ‘climate change’ or ‘fuel poverty’ or otherwise speak about the motivations for their actions to the jurors trying them during a trial relating to Insulate Britain’s campaign on M25. [11]The imprisonment of people for speaking the ‘whole truth’ in British courtrooms sparked a wave of nonviolent direct actions designed to bring to public attention the principle of jury equity, which is deemed to be under threat by leading legal figures. [12][13][14]This is the sixth jury trial of women from Extinction Rebellion who have ‘broken glass’ at major banks and fossil fuel headquarters. Of the twenty women who have stood trial so far, ten have been found guilty and ten have been acquitted (found not guilty). In July 2022, six medics also broke glass at the JPMorgan’s Canary Wharf Headquarters in anticipation of the hottest day ever recorded in the UK. [15]The defendants on trial at Inner London Crown Court next week are;Stephanie Aylett, 29, a former medical device representative from St Albans Pamela Bellinger, 66, a vegetable grower from LeicesterAmy Pritchard, 38, a student from LiverpoolAdelheid Russenberger, 32 PhD student from Richmond, LondonRosemary (Annie) Webster, 67, a retired cook and beekeeper from Dorchester, DorsetInsulate Britain supporters who sat on M25At Reading Crown Court the trial of eight Insulate Britain supporters begins. The eight have been charged with Public Nuisance relating to a peaceful roadblock of junction 31, Purfleet Interchange on the M25 motorway on 13th September 2021.Insulate Britain supporters undertook eighteen days of action on the M25 between 13th September and 4th November 2021 to demand that the government insulate Britain’s cold and leaky homes to end fuel poverty and decarbonise the UK, something which the government is legally obliged to do. [16][17]The trial is due to be heard by Judge Campbell and is scheduled for fifteen days. Several of the defendants will be self-representing in court. The Prosecutor representing the Crown is Maryam Syed a former Judge turned-prosecutor who’s specialism is counter-terrorism. [18]The defendants are;David Crawford, 70, a retired Engineer from DorkingGabriella Ditton, 30, a waiter from NorwichJanine Eagling, 62, a retired IT project manager from LondonLou Lancaster, 58, a teacher from CambridgeNick Onley,  61, a musician and community worker from Exmouth Rob Stuart, 42, a mental healthcare professional from LondonNicholas Till, 68, a university professor from LondonBiff Whipster, 56, a retired business analyst from CanterburyTunnel campaign supporters from Just Stop OilThe trial of five Just Stop Oil supporters will be heard by Judge Graham at Basildon Crown Court. The charges of Public Nuisance and Conspiracy to cause a Public Nuisance relate to a series of tunnels that were occupied close to Grays Oil Terminal in Essex in August 2022. Some of the defendants spent thirteen days underground, demanding the government immediately halt all new oil, coal and gas projects in the UK. The trial is scheduled for four weeks. Two of the defendants will be self-representing in court. [19][20]Judge Graham has been newly appointed to this case after Judge Collery (previously assigned) was shuffled out following increasingly high-profile and widespread criticism of the prison terms he imposed on two Just Stop Oil supporters last year which were the longest sentences received in modern history for a nonviolent direct action. [21]The defendants on trial at Basildon Crown Court next week are; Christopher Bennett, 32, a support worker from Bristol Joe Howlett, 33, a musician from Somerset Samuel Johnson, 40, a construction worker from Reydon, Suffolk Dr Larch Maxey, 51, a sustainability researcher and consultant from London Autumn Wharrie, a mother and grandmother from Stepney Xavier Gonzalez TrimmerThis week marks one year since Xavier Gonzalez Trimmer, 22 from London, took his own life just two weeks after being sentenced by Judge Reid at Inner London Crown Court on 31st January 2023. [22][23]Xavier had been ‘on’ electronic tag for 5 months before his death and prior to this had been remanded to prison for twenty-one days. Friends have said they feel that Xavier’s experience of prison and the restrictive ‘curfew’ electronic tag conditions he lived with in his final months were a major contributing factor to the suffering that led to his suicide. [24]Xavier would have been on trial with his friends and colleagues in two of the cases detailed above, the Insulate Britain group and also the Just Stop Oil tunnelers.Confirming the injustice currently being perpetrated by the UK Judiciary, UN Special Rapporteur, Forst, said; ”Such severe bail conditions have significant impacts on the environmental defenders’ personal lives and mental health and I seriously question the necessity and proportionality of such conditions for persons engaging in peaceful protest.” ENDPress Contacts:Extinction Rebellion: [email protected] / +44(0)7756136396Insulate Britain: [email protected] / +44(0)7762 987334Just Stop Oil: [email protected] / +44(0)7762 987334Images FREE TO USE available here:Extinction Rebellion: https://show.pics.io/xr-global-media-breaking-news/search?collectionIds=612f22cd49d6920012aa40e5Insulate Britain: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kTAV_CBp6GtbDrpO4h7-NRmLxj97uBm2?usp=sharingJust Stop Oil: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dgcuv5vJjzfdSrdpX6HJEaayoidc08xyNotes to Editors[1] Everybody wants Gaza’s gas:  https://www.planetcritical.com/p/everybody-wants-gazas-gasThis Genocide is about oil: https://atmos.earth/this-genocide-is-about-oil/ [2] Why the war in Iraq was fought for Big Oil: https://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/19/opinion/iraq-war-oil-juhasz/index.html[3] World’s first year-long breach of key 1.5 warming limit:https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68110310Global heating breaches 1.5C for full year for first time: https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/january-hottest-on-record-global-warming-b2492674.html[4] New fossil fuels ‘incompatible’ with 1.5C goal https://www.carbonbrief.org/new-fossil-fuels-incompatible-with-1-5c-goal-comprehensive-analysis-finds/[5] Belief in Consent; Criminal Damage Act 1971 Section 5(2)(a)[6] Attorney General seeks criminal damage clarity from Court of Appeal: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-seeks-criminal-damage-clarity-from-co[7] Extinction Rebellion co-founder convicted after four-year legal saga: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67288289 [8] Michel Forst UN Special Rapporteur: [9] XR Press Release: IN CASE OF CLIMATE EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS: [10] JPMorgan pour $434 billion into Fossil Fuels since 2016 Paris Agreement: https://www.desmog.com/2023/04/12/banks-fossil-fuels-finance-climate-chaos-royal-bank-canada-jpmorgan-chase/[11] Amy Pritchard & Giovanna Lewis jailed by Judge Reid: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11818173/Two-Insulate-Britain-protesters-jailed-contempt-court.htmlDavid Nixon jailed by Judge Reid: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/07/insulate-britain-activist-david-nixon-jailed-for-eight-weeks-for-contempt-of-court[12] Professor Richard Vogler: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/27/trudi-warner-english-courts-juriesCourt restrictions on climate protesters ‘deeply concerning’, say leading lawyers: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/08/court-restrictions-on-climate-protesters-deeply-concerning-say-leading-lawyers[13]  Defend our Juries: https://defendourjuries.org/ [14] Jury Equity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification[15] Doctors for XR break glass at JP Morgan: https://extinctionrebellion.uk/2022/07/17/breaking-doctors-for-xr-crack-glass-at-jp-morgan-as-uk-declares-heatwave-national-emergency/[16] Insulate Britain: ‘We have to keep going’: https://insulatebritain.com/2021/09/13/we-have-to-keep-going/[17] M25 protest: Insulate Britain releases statement: https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/m25-protest-insulate-britain-issues-5907713[18] Maryam Syed’s Linkedin page: https://uk.linkedin.com/in/maryam-syed-7a54aa251?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name[19] Just Stop Oil supporters block critical oil terminals with roadblocks and tunnels: [20] Just Stop Oil tunnelers leave Grays tunnel after 13 days: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-62790218[21] Celebrities urge Home Office to reconsider Marcus Decker’s deportation:https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/26/geldof-coleman-urge-home-office-to-reconsider-climate-activist-marcus-decker-deportationUN criticises ‘severe’ Just Stop Oil sentences:https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0p6ll3jjgoJust Stop Oil pair in bid to challenge ‘longest’ sentences:https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/just-stop-oil-court-of-appeal-thornton-london-essex-police-b2382289.html[22] HS2: Activists spray paint HS2’s Euston offices bright pink:https://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/article/hs2-activists-spray-paint-hs2s-euston-offices-bright-pink[23] Insulate Britain activist Xavier Gonzalez-Trimmer found dead: Insulate Britain activist Xavier Gonzalez-Trimmer found deadThe Guardianhttps://www.theguardian.com › environment › feb › i…[24] Just Stop Oil activist facing six court cases took his own life: https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/just-stop-oil-activist-facing-27308140 Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

The others are either supporting genocide or failing to do what is needed as we face the loss of ordered civil society. Labour is backing the Tory’s new oil and gas while supporting mass killing in Gaza, while the Conservatives have systematically failed to defend the UK. The other parties offer no radical path to bring people together, the only pathway to work out how we face our current predicament. Just Stop Oil, along with many Rochdale voters, can see that politics is broken and is not protecting us.

"52","Gantry climber faces Crown Court",2024-02-05,"Just Stop Oil supporter, Cressie Gethin, who climbed a motorway gantry above the M25 in July 2022, faces trial at Isleworth Crown Court from today. [1] Cressie will appear before Judge Duncan charged with causing a public nuisance for climbing a gantry above the M25 on the 20th of July 2022. She was arrested alongside four other supporters of Just Stop Oil who climbed gantries in two other locations on the M25. They were demanding the government halt licensing and consents for the development of any new fossil-fuel projects in the UK. The trial is expected to last a week. Two other Just Stop Oil supporters arrested on the day have pleaded guilty to causing a public nuisance, they are due to be sentenced by the 20th of February. Cressie Gethin, 22, a musician from Hereford said: “I empathise sincerely with everyone who was affected by this action, and I hope that some can understand that I acted for them and their children. The 40C heatwave which prompted my actions was a taster of the avoidable suffering being facilitated by the government. In a time of crisis it becomes a moral compulsion to sound the alarm.” The day of action on the M25 came in response to the unprecedented heatwave in July 2022 that saw temperatures in the UK rise above 40 degrees for the first time, a milestone that scientists previously thought was impossible. On the 18th of July 2022, the UK Health Security Agency and Met Office issued the first ever level-four alert, as the government declared a national emergency. Rail services were severely disrupted due to tracks buckling in the heat and overhead cables sagging and Network Rail issued a ‘do not travel’ warning on the 19th July. During the summer of 2022, an estimated 2,985 excess deaths were associated with the heat, the highest number ever recorded. Just a day prior to the hottest day on record, the high court ruled the Government’s Net Zero strategy unlawful. [2][3][4][5] Cressie is charged with causing a public nuisance, a statutory offence under the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022. Earlier this month, Michel Forst, the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders released a statement, which severely criticises the UK Government’s increasingly draconian treatment of peaceful climate action, suggesting that Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain supporters are being subject to “persecution, penalization or harassment”. [6] He made reference to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, saying: “I learned that, in the UK, peaceful protesters are being prosecuted and convicted under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, for the criminal offence of “public nuisance”, which is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment.” “It is important to highlight that, prior to these legislative developments, it had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for members of the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK. I am therefore seriously concerned by these regressive new laws.” Just Stop Oil supporters are refusing to allow the breakdown of ordered society and a collapse of the rule of law as a result of the selfish actions of a few. The people of the UK have had enough of the corruption and lies of those running the country and are stepping into civil resistance in order to save our communities from the worst of climate breakdown. It is not a case of ‘if’ we will win, but ‘when.’","https://juststopoil.org/2024/02/05/gantry-climber-faces-crown-court/",1
"53","The End Game has Arrived",2024-01-25,"By Donnachadh McCarthy, 25th Jan 2024 There is only ONE REASON why Just Stop Oil climate protectors are being jailed: The UK’s 4 climate-trashing media billionaires insisted that they be jailed. There is only ONE REASON why Just Stop Oil’s key single demand #NoNewOil has not been implemented by the UK government: The UK’s 4 climate-trashing media billionaires insisted that the UK government reject JSO and instead max out UK North Sea oil and gas reserves. For many climate protectors who do not read the billionaire owned tabloids (Mail, Sun,Telegraph) or watch their new far-right TV stations GB News and Talk TV, this may seem exaggerated. Many are unaware of the full-scale billionaire-media war being waged on UK climate action and how despite dwindling circulations, they wield enormous unaccountable political power over UK policy, including climate policy. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, outlined to a Parliamentary Select Committee the direct impact the right-wing media had on Johnson’s decision making. The Climate Media Coalition in 2022 carried out an analysis of the process leading up to the UK government’s energy security strategy, drafted after the energy crisis provoked by the invasion of Ukraine. We looked at opinion polling on eight energy policy issues covered by the strategy. We then analysed the coverage of these issues in the editorial and comment pages of the billionaire media. And finally, we looked at the government policy positions adopted by the published strategy. The eight policy issues were: onshore wind, offshore wind, solar, nuclear, fusion, insulation, fracking and new North-sea oil drilling. The public by significant majorities supported onshore wind, offshore wind, solar and insulation. They opposed new North Sea oil and gas, fracking and nuclear. There was no polling on fusion. The billionaire media supported new North Sea oil and gas, fracking, nuclear and fusion. They opposed onshore wind, insulation and solar. The government’s final strategy? Every single policy position reflected the eight policy positions of the billionaire media! Only one item reflected what the public supported. The only one also supported by the billionaire media. We are the only nation on earth to have had a de facto ban on onshore wind for the last decade after the Telegraph and Mail demanded it be banned. This evidence graphically demonstrates the raw climate-trashing political power of the UK’s billionaire press and the threat it poses to humanity and what is left of nature. Murdoch (owner of the Sun) and Rothermere (owner of The Mail) abused their power by bullying the police and government into introducing not just one but TWO new  Acts of Parliament, to punitively try to destroy Just Stop Oil, Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion and are actively lobbying for a third, following the peaceful Palestinian protests. The Guardian has reported that distinguished international scientists identified Rupert Murdoch, as one of the key media billionaires endangering humanity. Prof Lesley Hughes, Australian Climate Change Authority said: “Rupert Murdoch bears enormous responsibility for the world’s lack of action on climate. His outlets promote scepticism about climate science that undermines the need to act.” Prof Michael Mann, University of Pennsylvania, said Murdoch is “one of the most destructive forces in modern history when it comes to climate action”. He wields his media empire as a cudgel to sow doubt about science and solutions. He is one of the greatest climate villains.” Dr Friederike Otto, Grantham Institute said: “Murdoch leaves a terrible legacy, that people are paying for, with lives and livelihoods. Climate protesters are portrayed as people trying to make life difficult for the average person, whereas of course they try to make it better” So what strategy should the climate movement now move forward with? What are the four pillars of the fossil fuelled economy? They are the government that regulates it, the oil industry that operates it, the banks that fund it but most importantly the corporate media that give it the social and political licence to operate. The media pillar is THE foundational pillar on which the other three depend. And the UK’s media billionaires Rupert Murdoch, Lord Rothermere, the Barclays and Paul Marshall have captured that pillar. Therefore, the climate movement’s TOP-PRIORITY must be one way or another to remove the billionaire climate-trashing media and instead create a free Fourth Estate that backs the urgent climate action and wildlife repair necessary. We must replace a bought press with a free press! The world has recognised how Ukraine has a right to self-defence from the brutal Russian invasion. It is time for the climate movement to recognise that all of humanity has a far, far -greater right to self-defence from the media billionaires’ war to destroy the climate, upon which nature and all future generations’ lives depend. But excitingly, in this battle there is a huge coalition out there gagging for leadership. Not least, the 76% of the UK public horrified by the billionaire-media backed Gazan genocide. There are deep chilling parallels between their support for the horrific Gazan genocide and their support for climate genocide and how both usurp British democracy. In the crucial parliamentary vote, 71% of MPs backed the billionaire media’s opposition to the ceasefire and betrayed their own constituents! There is hardly a section of the population that the billionaire media have not vilified at one time or another. These include NHS staff, gay people, trade-unions, wildlife protectors, freedom of the press campaigners, human rights advocates, refugees, immigrants, EU residents, civil servants, locally elected councils, the disabled, the unemployed, travellers, Muslims, women, cyclists, the Church of England, etc etc. When Extinction Rebellion successfully blockaded Murdoch’s printing works for just 12 hours in 2020, a ripple of excitement ran across the nation. Finally, somebody had stood up to the billionaire media dictatorship brutalising Britain. Just imagine what would happen, if we broke the hold they have on our democracy? Imagine if every front page constantly screamed for action on climate and wildlife?! The fossil fuelled criminal establishment would be gone within a year. The banks would be funding the renewable energy economy, the government would regulate for a net zero economy by 2030 and the oil corporations would become renewable energy corporations. If Just Stop Oil and the wider climate movement are to win (and we must!) – then it needs to now focus, focus, focus on the one key positive and uplifting political revolution that can enable our success – peaceful direct action and building a pan-societal coalition to win the media battle for human and wildlife survival. It is the media stupid!

"54","UN Rapporteur Michel Forst makes unprecedented intervention against “regressive” protest laws",2024-01-23,"The UN has released a statement which severely criticises the UK Government increasingly draconian treatment of peaceful climate action, suggesting that Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain supporters are being subject to “persecution, penalization or harassment”. At 9:30am this morning the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe released a statement from Michel Forst, the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders. It severely criticises the oppressive legal measures being used to silence, hinder, and imprison supporters of Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain for their work as “environmental defenders in the United Kingdom”. [1] [2] Michel Forst was appointed to this role in 2022, after six years spent as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders. He remarked: “We are in the midst of a triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Environmental defenders are acting for the benefit of us all. It is therefore imperative that we ensure that they are protected.” He made reference to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which was authored by oil-funded rightwing think tank Policy Exchange, as well as the Public Order Act 2023 which was described by Amnesty International as “deeply authoritarian”, saying: [3] [4] “I learned that, in the UK, peaceful protesters are being prosecuted and convicted under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, for the criminal offence of “public nuisance”, which is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment.” “I was also informed that the Public Order Act 2023 is being used to further criminalize peaceful protest. In December 2023, a peaceful climate protester who took part for approximately 30 minutes in a slow march on a public road was sentenced to six months imprisonment under the 2023 law… prior to these legislative developments, it had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for members of the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK. I am therefore seriously concerned by these regressive new laws.” He also discussed cases of Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain supporters being silenced in court, such as by Judge Silas Reid, commenting: [5] “I was also alarmed to learn that, in some recent cases, presiding judges have forbidden environmental defenders from explaining to the jury their motivation for participating in a given protest or from mentioning climate change at all. It is very difficult to understand what could justify denying the jury the opportunity to hear the reason for the defendant’s action.” A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “We take action because we know that the climate crisis represents the greatest threat to human rights that the planet has ever seen. Already, people in the global south have been marked as ‘expendable’ in the pursuit of bloated oil profits. Sudanese people are being forced from their homelands by floods and drought, while fatalities from deadly ‘wet bulb temperatures’ are spiking in India. In the UK, the prison ship Bibby Stockholm is a disgraceful violation of human rights that’s harming people fleeing climate collapse. It’s a detention centre for asylum seekers where Leonard Farruku recently took his own life thanks to the unlivable conditions he experienced.” Forst highlighted the dangerous usage of injunctions to target nonviolent campaigners, saying:“I am deeply troubled at the use of civil injunctions to ban protest in certain areas, including on public roadways. Anyone who breaches these injunctions is liable for up to 2 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine.” “The fact that a significant number of environmental defenders are currently facing both a criminal trial and civil injunction proceedings for their involvement in a climate protest on a UK public road or motorway, and hence are being punished twice for the same action, is also a matter of grave concern to me.”","https://juststopoil.org/2024/01/23/un-rapporteur-michel-forst-makes-unprecedented-intervention-against-regressive-protest-laws/",2

Storms are already making our homes unsafe. Fires, floods, and famines are the direct consequence of oil drilling. Millions are starving globally. The criminals in Parliament are responsible for this genocide. It’s been proven that exploiting more North Sea Oil will leave us poorer, less secure, and facing energy blackouts. To all the Labour MPs who voted against the bill this evening: we’ll be holding you to this. The people want safety, security, and a liveable future.

"56","Climate defenders gather at parliament to resist Government’s ‘deadly’ new oil and gas bill",2024-01-22,"This morning, Fossil Free London, Just Stop Oil, Extinction Rebellion and Scientists for Extinction Rebellion supporters staged a demonstration to resist the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill, which is having its second reading at the House of Commons. Members of the groups came together at Parliament Square with banners and placards to voice their outrage against the Bill, moving to the gates of Parliament where MPs enter to vote. If passed, the bill will allow fossil fuel corporations to bid for new North Sea licences every year. The bill comes after the Government and North Sea Transition Authorities already announced their plan to give out more than 100 production licences for new oil and gas in the North Sea. [1] [2] Whilst the Conservative government justifies continued extraction of new North Sea oil and gas, claiming it’s cleaner than importing gas from outside the UK and will improve the country’s energy security, experts have refuted both claims. The Government has now also publicly admitted that any gas and oil extracted from the North Sea wouldn’t actually go to UK consumers; it would be sold in the international market. [3] The Government’s expansion plans for North Sea Oil and Gas comes as 2023 was marked as the hottest year ever recorded on Earth, smashing scientists predictions. Further too, the International Energy Agency stated back in 2021 that there can be new oil, gas or coal development if the world is to reach net zero by 2050; a target the UK Government is legally bound to. [4][5][6] Energy Secretary Clare Coutinho has admitted new North Sea oil and gas won’t bring down household energy bills. In fact, analysis by Uplift has shown that the development of the Rosebank oil field alone will cost the UK taxpayer £3.75 billion in tax relief. [7][8] Joanna Warrington, spokesperson for Fossil Free London, said: “The UK Government’s Offshore Petroleum Licences Bill is nothing short of deadly. Pressing ahead with fossil fuel expansion plans in the midst of climate breakdown just makes us less energy secure and fuels the UK’s freak floods as more of our coastal homes drop into the sea. The government is making the interests they serve plain –  it’s oily millionaires burning our house down for profit. ” Pete Knapp of Scientists for Extinction Rebellion said: “New oil and gas will do nothing to bring down our energy bills, or help with our energy security as most of the oil will be sold on the world market. New oil and gas is also incompatible with keeping within 1.5C. The government is either scientifically illiterate, is playing political games with our futures, or just doesn’t care, but, most likely – all three. After everyone agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at COP28 in December, what message is this sending to the rest of the world?” Kush Naker, a Just Stop Oil supporter and Doctor of infectious diseases said:“This bill shows us what the governments true priorities are, they are happy to sacrifice the lives of the British public just to maximise the oil company profits” “This government is addicted to oil, even though it is killing us. It’s like we have got cancer, but the government is still forcing us to smoke more cigarettes.” “Many Tory MPs know they’ll be kicked out at the next election, so they’ve become even more unhinged. They’re using these last few months to rush through more bills to please their oily billionaire chums in a desperate hope they’ll be offered jobs once they lose their seats. It’s pure greed.” Sources: Notes: Just Stop Oil ‘Blue Lights’ policy: our policy is, and has always been, to move out of the way for emergency vehicles with siren sounding and ‘blue lights’ on.

"57","Hope Against Hope: Recruiting Conservatives",2024-01-17,"by Roger Hallam (first published on the 14/Jan/2024 (This article was recently rejected for publication by Unherd, a social conservative media group focused on preserving traditional values. It is dedicated to Chris Skidmore, who resigned (5th Jan 2024) in protest against new oil and gas licences, making him the only true conservative in the House of Commons). The second most depressing moment of the last few years was being invited to be interviewed by a guy from Unherd (1). He merrily said to me before the recorded conversation, “let’s not talk about science”. Which is like talking about Attila the Hun without mentioning the killing. The fact that a supposedly serious conservative political media organisation has no interest in “what is actually going on” sums up the mess of our times. In many ways the interview went well as it opened a few doors. Firstly, I surprised them by suggesting the end of civilization might actually upset conservatives. Secondly, it led to a few nice chats with a Tory MP and a bigger chat with a bunch of conservatives at the Houses of Parliament. Predictably, when I mentioned that the bullet of deadly carbon emissions had already left the gun but not yet entered the head, I was told that being negative was bad for getting votes. The Tory MP told me afterwards I was the only true conservative in the room, and for a moment I thought I might have finally found the Churchill of my dreams. But as soon as things heated up, he ignored me. He cut himself off when Insulate Britain blocked the M25 for the ‘revolutionary’ demand of better housing insulation. He has since refused to answer my occasional emails along the lines of – “Hi, remember me? The science doesn’t go away just because you are playing hard to get” (2). I’ve just been found guilty of Conspiracy to Cause a Public Nuisance (doesn’t the English ruling class always have a pleasing way with words?) by a hung jury for flying toy drones at head height. By breaking the airport’s drone safety procedure we aimed to stop arguably the biggest crime in UK history – the building of the third runway. The conservatives in the room – the judge and the prosecutor, both of a certain age and a certain class – displayed an inability to think which arguably surpasses the banal evil of Adolf Eichmann. The objectivity of mass death was reduced to “your passionate views” and the tool of the mass death is described as “those wicked carbon emissions”. I was subjected to six hours of interrogatory nonsense around my intentions, while the judge did the classic bystander routine. The jury stared into space in bemused boredom. They listened to those representing our failing politicians, the prosecution lawyers, trying to convince them that flying a toy drone below head height and a bit of enthusiastic messaging constitutes a jailable offence. Meanwhile, the crime of destroying British society through the biggest carbon infrastructure in Europe cannot be spoken of. It made 1984 look like kids’ play. From on high we were all informed that “defence of necessity” is “not permitted”.  Can you imagine that being said to the French resistance? I don’t know why I am writing this other than to hopelessly fail to express my utter horror and despair. It is not possible to convey the intensity of feeling signified by those two words, “not permitted”. For some reason I am comforting myself by listening to Mike Duncan’s History of Rome podcast in the evenings. It’s all happened before of course – you start off with semi decent Augustus, pass onto a paranoid Tiberius, and end up with the cesspit of Caligula. And so it was and ever will be, as social conservatives should know. Except this time round the pit is bottomless, the suffering infinite, the end final. Maybe writing this is like the man on an island, half-starved, who lights a last fire to try to attract a passing ship. It’s pathetic, I know, but something in my soul holds onto the idea there is a real social conservative out there who is not totally morally and spiritually dead. Hope against hope.

"58","Four Just Stop Oil supporters found Not Guilty, as Judge declares they had lawful excuse to disrupt roads",2024-01-09,"Four Just Stop Oil supporters were acquitted of wilful obstruction of the highway on Monday afternoon, as the Judge declared they had a lawful excuse for their actions. [1] Miranda Forward, Dave Boden, Chris Hardy and Annotony Cottam appeared before District Judge Lloyd, at Stratford Magistrates court on Monday. The four Just Stop Oil supporters peacefully blocked roads into Parliament Square with 60 others on the 4th of October 2022. Their actions were part of a month of continuous action to ‘Occupy Westminster’ in order to demand that the government call a halt to all new fossil fuel licenses and consents. The prosecution were relying on helicopter footage of Parliament Square from the day in question, however, finding no evidence of ‘significant disruption’, District Judge Lloyd delivered a not-guilty verdict. The court heard the supporters of Just Stop Oil argue that blocking the roads to Parliament Square was proportionate under articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention of Human rights- the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association. Judge LLoyd agreed that there was a lawful excuse for their actions, addressing the defendants directly she said that their motivations “could not be more important.” One of those acquitted yesterday, Dave Boden, said, “For the sake of future generations, other animals and for our life-support systems, I felt I had no other choice but to act in face of climate breakdown, given that our government acts in defiance of all science and reason.” A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Instead of prosecuting grandmothers, students and doctors, the courts and police should focus on the breakdown of ordered society that is a guaranteed side effect of more oil extraction. It is a waste of public money, police time, court time and our time. Of Just Stop Oil supporters arrested, less than 50% have ended up in a conviction. Politics is failing us, it is time to arrest the real criminals in Government, who are planning the deaths of countless millions for the sake of profiting the richest corporations.” These acquittals come as a case against supporters of Just Stop Oil was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service. Supporters of Just Stop Oil were expected to appear at City of London Magistrates court this morning, charged with breaching section 12 of the public order act, after marching peacefully in Parliament square on the 19th of July 2023. They were joined by 160 supporters of Just Stop Oil marching across London in resistance against new oil and gas. They were informed that the trial would not go ahead as the chief inspector due to testify against the supporters of Just Stop Oil was on holiday. Just Stop Oil supporters are refusing to allow the breakdown of ordered society and a collapse of the rule of law as a result of the selfish actions of a few. The people of the UK have had enough of the corruption and lies of the people leading the country off a very steep cliff.

"59","Just Stop Oil representatives open negotiations with the Metropolitan Police",2024-01-08,"Representatives of Just Stop Oil met with the Metropolitan Police Force today to discuss relations going forward, after the Police requested Just Stop Oil meet with them late last year. Just Stop Oil supporters caused significant disruption in the capital last year, demanding that the UK government immediately halts all new licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration and extraction. [1] At 1pm today representatives of Just Stop Oil- Sarah Lunnon, Indigo Rumbelow and Eben Lazarus, met with officers Karen Findlay, Simon Hearn, and Sian Thomas, at the Met’s office at 109 Lambeth road. The meeting comes after a request from Commander Kyle Gordon that “Just Stop Oil come forward and speak with us, so we can actually work with them.” Just Stop Oil responded with a letter on December 8th last year proposing a meeting with Sir Mark Rowley. [2] Just Stop Oil co-founder Sarah Lunnon said today: “We met with Metropolitan Police to present evidence that by developing new oil and gas projects, the activities of the British Government constitute an act of ‘genocide by oblique intent’, as defined under Article 30 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Public Order Commander Karen Findlay requested a copy of our evidence and told us she will be taking this information to the Commissioner and Specialist Operations – which covers genocide crimes. We have offered a pause on disruptive Just Stop Oil actions if this investigation is to go ahead. Negotiations are ongoing. Just Stop Oil is calling on the police to investigate and charge the real criminals who are responsible for this unfolding genocide – they can start with PM Rishi Sunak, Shell CEO Wael Sawan, Lloyd’s London CEO John Neal, Barclay’s Chair Nigel Higgens, and Telegraph owner Fred Barclay.” Article 30 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court states that a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if the perpetrator clearly has an understanding that significant loss of human life will occur ‘in the ordinary course of events’ after undertaking a course of action. The five individuals named by Sarah Lunnon are detailed on the Just Stop Oil website. [3] [4] Just Stop Oil support Eben Lazarus remarked: “Last year the Dutch Police Federation, ANPV, Equipe and ACP [police unions] wrote an open letter to the Dutch Government demanding that the government listen to the public as they cried out for a safe and sustainable future. NPCC lead for Protest Policing Chief Constable Chris Noble has said ‘we’re not going to arrest our way out of environmental protest’. The Met have told us that their primary concern at this moment is policing ‘environmental protests’. We wasted no time informing them that if new oil and gas licences are granted,  then not only protest but disruption and violence should be expected when the public are in danger of flood, fire, and famine. How will they uphold public order when there’s no food on the shelves?” Yesterday the Metropolitan Police released their Force Management Statement 2023. It drew a link between potential terrorism and “environmentalism, given the ever-increasing sentiment within this lobby and a sense of not being listened to by the Government”. Just Stop Oil responded by affirming its nonviolent ethos, but noting that without immediate political action on the climate crisis then “then the Police are right, there is the potential for a violent response. The route to avoiding this is to end new oil and gas and mobilise the country to deal with climate breakdown”.

Just Stop Oil will not enter into any “debates” about agreed climate science, and we ask that you make a statement assuring us that you will not host another such “debate”. Warm regards, Just Stop Oil Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"62","Shane MacGowan’s widow calls on The Pogues to support climate song, “We Tried” for Christmas No.1 instead of “Fairytale of New York”",2023-12-20,"To the utter amazement of young climate activist and musician, Louise Harris, Victoria Mary Clarke, the recently widowed wife of Shane MacGowan, has called on The Pogues to support her climate song, “We Tried”, to be Christmas No.1. On Tuesday evening, Louise posted a direct appeal to Victoria, via a public video on social media (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram), where she stated:“I’m asking if you would please consider backing my song, “We Tried”, written about the climate crisis and what will happen if we don’t act, for Christmas Number One this year, instead of your husband, Shane MacGowan’s, song, “Fairytale of New York”. Louise called on her followers on Twitter and Instagram to tag Victoria in the comments and in their story, “so there’s a chance she actually gets to see this”. Victoria replied as soon as an hour later to her posts, across platforms. One particular reply came in response to the following comment on Louise’s video appeal: “@branchytreeart: @victoriamaryclarke Fairytale of New York will be in the charts every Christmas til the end of time, please help shift the focus this year before we lose any more precious time on to the climate crisis and the action that needs to be taken now so that we might have a future ❤️ thank you x” Victoria simply replied: “I would love to help”. Victoria then took to Twitter immediately, sharing Louise’s music video, retweeting Louise’s call to action to make “We Tried” a climate Christmas No.1, and quote tweeting Louise’s video appeal, tagging none other than The Pogues, Shane MacGowan, various journalists & presenters, as well as the CEO of Johnny Depp’s entertainment company, in2.film. She said: “This is so beautiful and brave and passionate! Let’s please support this cause!!! @poguesofficial @sunstroke_house @ShaneMacGowan @itsanitarani @timjonze @shattenstone @AoDespair” Victoria also commented on the YouTube video of Louise’s appeal: “Thank you so much for your passion and your commitment and your courage ❤️ I am sharing your song ❤️”. The following morning, Wed 20th, Victoria also shared another of Louise’s Reels to her Instagram story, where Louise says “COME ON WE ARE JUST UNDERNEATH THE POGUES !!!!!!!” and highlights how “We Tried” is sitting just underneath The Pogues at No.5 in the iTunes Single Chart and Digital Sales UK Chart. “We Tried” has now entered the Betting Race for Christmas No.1 for the first time. Odds have already fallen from 490:1 to 14:1, making it 4th favourite to win. Known for her internationally viral moment crying on a gantry above the M25 as part of a Just Stop Oil protest, Louise wrote “We Tried” deliberately from our currently projected future perspective of irreversible climate catastrophe (“We ran out of time…oh well, we tried”). Louise hopes this song will allow people to feel how they would feel if this future happened – and then use that feeling to spur themselves into the only hopeful solution left: collective climate action. Her heart-wrenching music video ends with the message: “It’s not too late to avoid irreversible climate catastrophe. “There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all” (IPCC Report, March 2023). We have time – but not for long. Join collective action today.” “This beautiful and moving song is a powerful weapon. We need to wake up to the cowardly inertia of our governments, to the greedy shortsightedness of business-as-usual, and to the numbing distractions of the media. This song woke me up. I hope it gets centuries of airtime.” – Brian Eno, musician and producer “It’s a beautiful song. It’s melodic. It’s ‘catchy’, it’s ’pop’, it’s ’sing-along’. It’s lovely, isn’t it…? No, it isn’t. It’s fucking horrific, terrifying and tragic. Listen to it, hear every desperate note, each lingering plea. Don’t just look at, see the pictures. Read the music, read the room, our planet’s youth in abject distress. This is their voice, their cry, their tears laid bare. So ask yourself: do you want this to be the ultimate anthem for doomed youth, a threnody for their funeral? It’s beautiful, beautiful for its razor sharp honesty, beautiful for its truth, beautiful for its purity of frightened heart. Please listen, please learn, please act”. – Chris Packham, Naturalist and TV Broadcaster","https://juststopoil.org/2023/12/20/shane-macgowans-widow-calls-on-the-pogues-to-support-climate-song-we-tried-for-christmas-no-1-instead-of-fairytale-of-new-york/",2
"63","An invitation to join us",2023-12-16,"To the 126 who wrote and signed the letter of solidarity with the nine women who smashed HSBC’s windows, and the jury who found them ‘not guilty’. We thank you for the support shown for those who have taken action, and resisted a harmful state. We see that those who signed include Marcus Decker and the recently released Morgan Trowland, who received long prison sentences for daring to act to defend life on earth. As the jury at Isleworth Crown Court after four weeks acquit Valerie Brown but find Roger Hallam and Dr Larch Maxey guilty of conspiracy to commit public nuisance and a Manchester Judge commits Stephen Gingell to prison for walking on a London road, we would like to agree with the final paragraphs of your letter: “It is now incumbent upon all good people of conscience to rise up as these women have, to pull together and find our collective power. We must all take the most effective action we can, find our courage and work in firm opposition to the dereliction of our only home. “We support all courageous and loving people who stand and fight for justice and the continuation of life on Earth. We will do everything we can to support them, and to play our part in building a new world where life is sacred.” The stakes are shockingly high: billions of deaths, the loss of the habitable world and ordered civil society. It’s not just about whales and polar bears anymore, important though they are. It’s every right and freedom that has been struggled and fought for lost, every cherished place, every culture, and every tradition gone. Given this, we who have been jailed and fined, who have been injuncted and arrested, we ask that you act on your words. Join us on the street and in the prisons and use your platforms to inspire and mobilise countless others to join. The law is important and public order is precious. It makes us feel safe and it protects the weak from the strong. Therefore the justification to break the law must be very strong. The reason to disrupt must be justified. Well, the situation today is that the law is allowing the continuing destruction of the future, public order is allowing the harm to continue, and business as usual is licensing the destruction of global societies. That is genuine justification. So, to protect the common good there is a requirement to disrupt the public order and to break the law. Our political system is failing us or we wouldn’t be here. Apart from the super rich, everyone in the country wants action to protect and defend our common future. We need to get together, support each other, and get on with the job. We owe it to our children – what could be more important than that? 1.5° has died. Now is the time to live life as a wonderful precious miracle worth defending. Join us.

"64","Just Stop Oil supporter given shock six month prison sentence for slow marching",2023-12-15,"At Manchester Magistrates Court on Thursday 14th December 2023, Judge Mitchell, sentenced a Just Stop Oil supporter to six months in prison for marching in the road after he pleaded guilty to breaching Section 7 of the Public Order Act. [1][2] Stephen Gingell, 57, a business owner and father of three from Manchester, was arrested on 13th November 2023 in London for peacefully slow marching. Along with 40 others, he spent approximately 30 minutes on a road in North London. Stephen pleaded guilty in November at Wimbledon Magistrates Court, London, and was transferred to Manchester Magistrates court for sentencing.[3] Speaking last year before taking action with Just Stop Oil, Stephen said: “I’ve got no choice, I’ve got three lovely children, what future are they going to have? I really fear for their lives” A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a law drafted by the fossil fuel lobby, was introduced in April by Priti Patel, and covers ‘Interference with the use or operation of key national infrastructure’. It seems this government has now made walking down the road, walking on the public highway an illegal act that is worthy of imprisonment. “How many fathers will be imprisoned before those planning to kill us are stopped? New oil and gas will see millions upon millions lose their homes, livelihoods and lives. Protected by the government, by failed politicians, by the police, those committing genocide continue to walk free, those protesting the killings are banged up. Whose side are you on?” A spokesperson from ‘Lawyers are Responsible’, a group of legal professionals, commented: “This sentence demonstrates the increasingly repressive environment that people find themselves in when they take entirely peaceful action to express concern about the climate and ecological crisis. Our legal system has become completely detached from the real threat to our futures posed by the climate and ecological emergency. People should not be criminalised for standing up for our futures.”","https://juststopoil.org/2023/12/15/just-stop-oil-supporter-given-shock-six-month-prison-sentence-for-slow-marching/",3
"65","Just Stop Oil supporters go Christmas carolling at Keir Starmer’s house",2023-12-14,"Just Stop Oil supporters briefly gathered outside Keir Starmer’s house to sing ‘climate-criminal’ Christmas carols. They are demanding that, as the likely leader of the next UK government, Keir Starmer commit to cancelling all new oil and gas licences, including those already greenlit by the current government. [1] At around 8:30pm, a group of nine supporters of Just Stop Oil gathered outside Keir Starmer’s London residence to deliver a letter and to sing re-imagined versions of Christmas carols and popular songs- calling on Starmer to end all new oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. The supporters could be seen holding signs saying “Revoke Rosebank” and “Arrest the real criminals”. Police ordered the group to disperse under section 42 of the criminal justice and police act and ordered them to leave the vicinity of the premises for three months or they would be arrested. Although Keir Starmer has stated that Labour will end new oil and gas projects in the UK, Labour has so far refused to cancel the new fossil fuel projects approved by Rishi Sunak’s government. This includes Rosebank, a project that is destined to emit more carbon into the atmosphere than 28 whole countries combined. [2] The carolers delivered a letter to Keir Starmer which can be read here. [3] One of those serenading Starmer this evening is Rory, from London, who is 25, and works as a secondary school teacher. He said: “Beyond the culture wars and political point scoring, our world is at a crisis point. Our homes and our families are under threat. Our political system is failing us. At a time where bold leadership is required to deal with the multiple crises we face, Labour are promising more of the same. Failing to revoke new oil licences would be tantamount to ‘rubber-stamping’ the last ditch, ‘slash and burn’ actions of the current Tory leadership, who are hell-bent on enriching themselves and those they serve in the oil and gas lobby. This complicity is nothing short of a crime against humanity.” Another of those ‘singing for Starmer’ is Rosie, aged 50, who works as an editor. She said: “Starmer knows he needs to do the right thing for his children, and that is to cancel all new oil and gas licences if he gets to number 10. He is a former human rights lawyer, he should know the difference between right and wrong. History will not be kind to those who knew how bad the situation was with the climate, but allowed the extremists in the Tory party and oil lobby to destroy everything for their own selfish enrichment- killing millions in the process. The Tories have no mandate to issue these licences, and as PM, Starmer’s obligation is to serve the public who want action on the climate crisis now. ” There have been 670 arrests of Just Stop Oil supporters since October 30th. There are currently three Just Stop Oil supporters in prison, two of which have been imprisoned for peacefully marching in the road. They join Marcus Decker, who has been imprisoned for over a year of his 2 years 7 months sentence. Fourteen Just Stop Oil supporters are currently under electronic tag surveillance. [4] Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, at the expense of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist. It is the will of the overwhelming majority of people that we take the actions necessary to ensure our survival and together we can make it happen. Our government are the real criminals – imprisoning peaceful people for taking proportionate action to protect their communities, whilst licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects, which will destroy everything we value. We’re coming together to demand an end to new oil and gas. It’s not a case of ‘if’ we will win; but ‘when’.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/12/14/just-stop-oil-supporters-go-christmas-carolling-at-keir-starmers-house/",3
"66","Just Stop Oil’s Christmas message to Keir Starmer",2023-12-14,"On the 14th December 2023, a group of Just Stop Oil Christmas carolers, singing ‘climate criminal’ carols, delivered the following letter to Keir Starmer: Dear Keir, We, alongside the majority of the British public, welcomed your commitment to protecting the lives of the British public, as well as the lives of countless others around the world, by ending new oil and gas projects in the UK. The impacts of burning fossil fuels are plain for all to see. Floods, fires, famine and drought. This year is the hottest on record. Already, we are seeing millions forced outside of the conditions suitable for supporting human life, and scientists are warning that we are on-course for mass crop failure and potential societal collapse if we continue on this trajectory. Since your initial statement, you appear to have wavered in your commitment to show real leadership on this issue. Your refusal to cancel the new oil and gas licences that are being approved by the current government (which includes the obscene Rosebank, a project that will emit more carbon into the atmosphere than 28 whole countries combined) is nothing short of a crime against humanity. This is the most critical juncture in human history and you will likely soon be in the fortunate position where you can enact real, meaningful change. The ramifications of the decisions you make, if you come to power, will be felt by the next thousand generations or more. As a father, it is certain that the lives of your son and daughter mean everything to you. What is the world that they are to inherit if we continue on this path? What kind of lives will they live in a world of increasingly unstable weather, extreme heat, drought, flooding, famine, disease and war? Our families deserve better. All of us need to consider how we will answer our children when they ask us ‘what did you do’ to avert this unfolding crisis. You have a choice. You can join a long list of politicians that promised change and delivered nothing, knowing full well that insufficient action is killing people right now and will result in the deaths of countless millions more. Or you can make a commitment to cancel all licences approved by the current government and end all future licensing and consents for fossil fuel exploration and extraction in the UK. Such a commitment would effectively end these projects now, enabling a transition to cheap, clean, green energy- cutting our bills; whilst ensuring a fair transition for those working in oil and gas into the sustainable jobs of the future. How do you want to be remembered Keir? As the ghost of Christmas past? Or as the man who gave us a future? It’s time for action, not words. Merry Christmas and a happy new year, to you and all your family. Kind regards, Just Stop Oil Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK.

"67","21 year old Just Stop Oil supporter released from prison after case dropped",2023-12-13,"This morning, Just Stop Oil supporter Cressida ‘Cressie’ Gethin, 21, was released from Stratford Magistrates court after spending 23 days on remand at HMP Bronzefield. Cressie’s case was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service. No reason was given by the judge for this decision, but factors leading to a decision like this can include the arrest being illegal or a lack of evidence. Cressie had taken action in support of Just Stop Oil’s demand that the UK Government halts all new licences for fossil fuels. [1] She had been charged with Wilful Obstruction of the Highway after taking part in a nonviolent march on the 17th November this year. A group of 20 students and Just Stop Oil supporters were slow marching from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square in central London when they were arrested by a group of 50 Metropolitan Police officers. Cressie was taken to a nearby station to spend the night, before being taken to Westminster Magistrates’s Court where she refused to engage with Judge Brown’s line of questioning, saying “I have a moral duty to remain in resistance given the scale of this crisis”. A transcript is available on the Just Stop Oil website. [2] Cressie was remanded to HMP Bronzefield for the weekend, before repeating the process at Westminster Magistrates Court on Monday 20th. At this point she was remanded to HMP Bronzefield in Surrey until her trial on 13th December. At the time of her release today, Cressie remarked: “I am very happy to be free, and am unimaginably grateful for the support I received whilst in prison. I stand by the actions I took which led to me being remanded. The government is catastrophically failing to tackle the climate crisis, and at the same time they are stripping away the democratic routes for citizens to hold them accountable.” “It is up to ordinary people to push back, to resist anti-democratic laws, and try to stop policies that are killing people. If the state wants to imprison me for doing that, they can. They can make up new laws but they cannot crush the integrity of people who follow a moral law and remain true to what is right. Thank you a hundred times over to all the people who wrote to me in prison, many of whom I have never met. I am so, so grateful.” On Monday the 11th of December, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case against Cressie and a discontinuation order was sent to Bronzefield Prison for her immediate release. Cressie was held in prison for a further 3 days despite being eligible for release. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Cressie’s imprisonment was illegal and deeply unethical. It perfectly shows the lengths the state will go to criminalise young people just because they’re for a future. Politics is broken – the police are protecting the real criminals and arresting innocent people. This can’t go on. ” “Last week the Metropolitan Police complained that they had spent £20 million policing Just Stop Oil recently – maybe they should reconsider wasting their resources on illegally locking up young people and instead focus on the breakdown of ordered society that’s a guaranteed side effect of more oil extraction?” A bail hearing is scheduled at Southwark Crown Court at 2pm today for Noah Crane, 18. He has been held on remand at HMP Wandsworth for 3 weeks. Yesterday, Morgan Trowland was freed after serving 14 months of a three year sentence he was given this year – the longest sentence in British history for undertaking nonviolent climate action. Morgan undertook this action in service of Just Stop Oil’s demand that the UK Government halts all new licences for fossil fuels in the UK. [3] Ella Ward, 20, remains in prison without trial, for peacefully marching in the road. Her next court hearing is scheduled for the 27th of December. She is expecting to spend Christmas in prison, as is Marcus Decker who is fighting a deportation order after taking action with Morgan Trowland.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/12/13/21-year-old-just-stop-oil-supporter-released-from-prison-after-case-dropped/",3
"68","Morgan Trowland released after serving 14 months of longest-ever climate sentence",2023-12-12,"Just Stop Oil supporter Morgan Trowland was released from HMP Highpoint in Suffolk at around 9:45am today, 14 months into a three year sentence. He was setenced in April 2023. This is the longest sentence in British history for undertaking nonviolent climate action. Morgan undertook this action in service of Just Stop Oil’s demand that the UK Government halts all new licenses for fossil fuels in the UK. [1] [2] A spokesperson from Just Stop Oil remarked: “We’re extremely pleased to see Morgan free once again. He acted with love, and was punished in a way that has terrifying implications for the rights of all people in the UK. The fact remains that Marcus Decker is still imprisoned, and is facing the prospect of being torn away from his family, his friends, and his community. Automatic deportation is a cruel and unusual punishment. We urge everyone to sign the petition to stop Marcus’ deportation.“ Recently, a group of notable figures including Dr. Rowan Williams (former Archbishop of Canterbury), Stephen Fry, and Emma Thompson signed a letter in support of the HSBC 9 action takers, calling on ‘good people of conscience’ to ‘the most effective action we can’, and ‘find our courage’. Morgan and Marcus both signed this letter, so now we ask – when will the other signatories find their courage to take effective action as they did? The only time to act is now”. [3]  Along with Marcus Decker, Morgan climbed the Queen Elizabeth II bridge, also known as the Dartford Crossing, in October 2022 and remained suspended there for 37 hours. He was arrested at the scene and immediately remanded. Marcus was sentenced to two years and seven months, and now is battling deportation to Germany due to a law that automatically deports foreign nationals sentenced to custodial sentences of more than 12 months. A petition requesting that the Home Office end proceedings against him has gained more than 146,000 signatures so far. [4] In November 2023, UN special rapporteur Ian Fry staged an intervention regarding the sentences granted to Morgan and Marcus. The specialist on human rights within the context of climate change wrote to Rishi Sunak, remarking: “I wish to express my concerns regarding the arrest and severity of the sentences of Mr. Trowland and Mr. Decker in relation to their work as environmental human rights defender. I am particularly concerned about the sentencing of both environmental human rights defenders in connection with the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association, as being significantly more severe than previous sentences imposed for this type of offending in the past”. [5] [6] Sunak struck back at this input, stating that the unprecedented sentences were “entirely right”. [7] During Morgan’s time in custody, he spent a great deal of time reading and studying. Particular interests of his were philosophy, literature, and poetry. He published writings and poems on his Medium page, while many of his hand-written reflections were scanned and posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) by his supporters. [8] [9] At the time of his release, Morgan addressed a group of friends who had come to collect him: “There’s one poem I’ve been reciting every time. It’s Percy Shelley’s elegy on the death of John Keats. Keats, of course, was a phenomenal poet. Probably because he was so compassionate, and empathetically intelligent. That poem expresses a lot of the grief and rage and madness that I feel now, witnessing an era of mass extinction. Somehow that’s soothing to witness someones else’s grief as it distracts from your own… but I’m not going to read that poem! Because I’m in too good a mood.“ I’m in too good a mood because I’ve discovered a lot good things about myself. Bad things too – but the good things seem to have won out.“ He went on read the poem ‘Julian and Maddalo’ by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, at the expense of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist. It is the will of the overwhelming majority of people that we take the actions necessary to ensure our survival and together we can make it happen. Our government is waging war on its people, and we’re fighting back. They’re the real criminals – imprisoning peaceful people for taking proportionate action to protect their communities, whilst licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects, which will destroy everything we value. We’re coming together to demand an end to new oil and gas. It’s not a case of ‘if’ we will win; but ‘when’.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/12/12/morgan-trowland-released-after-serving-14-months-of-longest-ever-climate-sentence/",1
"69","Just Stop Oil supporters formally invite Commissioner Mark Rowley to engage in talks",2023-12-08,"Today at 12:10 pm, two Just Stop Oil supporters visited Scotland Yard to deliver a letter inviting Mark Rowley to a formal meeting. Just Stop Oil supporters have been causing disruption in London over the past several weeks to demand that the UK government immediately halts all new licenses and consents for fossil fuel exploration and extraction. [1] The letter was refused by the staff at Scotland Yard. However, Just Stop Oil is also in touch with the Metropolitan Police by email and social media, and hope to arrange a meeting with the Commissioner as soon as possible. Today’s letter from Just Stop Oil comes in response to a request from Commander Kyle Gordon that “Just Stop Oil come forward and speak with us, so we can actually work with them.” [2] The letter from Just Stop Oil reads: Dear Sir Mark Rowley, Recent statements from the Met Police indicate that policing Just Stop Oil actions has cost the police nearly £20 million. What a waste, and as you point out, arresting non-violent grandmothers, teenagers, vicars, medics, engineers is not the best use of your resources. We have previously reached out to you, and various police federations earlier this year. Just Stop Oil representatives would be able to meet with you, at your Scotland Yard office, in the week commencing 11th December 2023. If this is not convenient please provide us with an alternative date. Previously, Just Stop Oil has repeatedly attempted to open dialogue with the Metropolitan Police, but have received no response. In October 2023, a Just Stop Oil supporter delivered an open letter to Mark Rowley, which can be read here. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “We understand that the vast majority of officers serving in the Metropolitan Police have stepped into their role out of a profound sense of duty and a desire to protect and serve their communities. Despite our obvious differences, that desire to protect our communities is something that we all share. However, objectively, at the present time, the leadership of this country are making decisions that threaten our homes, our families, our communities and our entire way of life. Continued expansion of oil and gas, against the advice of the entire scientific consensus, is leading to crop failure, food shortages and will eventually lead to mass civil unrest, social collapse and an end to the rule of law. I would ask those serving in the police force to consider the actions that they take at this time very seriously. How will you answer your children in the years to come, when they ask you ‘what did you do’ to stop this crisis unfolding? Did you follow the orders of the people directly profiting from the industries ravaging our shared home? Did you facilitate the actions of people that future generations will come to regard as criminals of the highest order? Or did you make another choice? Did you follow through on your commitment to protect and serve your community and to protect the interests of your children and of generations to come?” One of those delivering the letter today is Pippa Cowtan, who is 22 years old and a recent politics graduate from London. She said: “I have been arrested numerous times by the Metropolitan police for nonviolent acts of civil resistance. I have had friends as young as 18 imprisoned, without trial, for trying to demand the government protect them, instead of only serving the interests of corporations and billionaires. Meanwhile, the powerful men profiting off the destruction of my home and my future are walking free. I just graduated, and in my lifetime scientists are predicting major ecological and social collapse. How can I plan for a future that is in such jeopardy? The police must act and hold the real criminals to account.” Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, at the expense of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist. It is the will of the overwhelming majority of people that we take the actions necessary to ensure our survival and together we can make it happen.

"70","“Are you discussing genocide?”: Injunction Injustice targets DLA Piper",2023-12-07,"Five people from Injunction Injustice disrupted a corporate presentation event at the offices of the law firm DLA Piper on Tuesday evening before they were ejected by security guards. The city law firm is profiting the most from the civil law injunctions brought by the government against Insulate Britain, Stop HS2 and Just Stop Oil.  [1]Tuesday evening at around 6pm, five people from Injunction Injustice stood outside the DLA Piper and Times newspaper sponsored event  ‘A Year In Review’ at 160 Aldersgate, London. They displayed banners, spoke to guests and at one point entered the foyer of the building before they were forcibly ejected by security guards. Guests included lawyers, consultants and DLA Piper clients from The Times, The Telegraph, the Spectator and The Guardian amongst others. The Injunction Injustice supporters were raising awareness of the role of law firms such as DLA Piper in helping the government to silence dissent and repress peaceful protest through the means of civil injunctions. As well as criminal charges, incarceration and tagging, climate defenders who may have breached an injunction simply by standing outside an oil terminal with a sign, face oppressive financial costs. The use of injunctions is having a chilling effect on peaceful protest; protest against new oil and gas licensing which will kill hundreds of millions of people. Scientists warn of untold suffering and death, of the collapse of whole nations, and the eradication by manmade global heating of entire peoples and cultures. New oil and gas means genocide and lawyers who are supporting the government in suppressing protest are complicit. Injunction Injustice supporter Karen Wildin said: “The role of lawyers and journalists is critical in these times. Most don’t seem to want to acknowledge this, probably because it requires significant shifts of attitude and mindset. However, they have huge power and therefore huge responsibility. “The most important thing any of us can do is acknowledge that business as usual is killing us. If we continue down the current path we face annihilation. This is especially true for young people and those in the global south for whom continuing with our fossil fuel addiction means genocide. “We asked the participants are you discussing genocide tonight ? And if not, why not ?” Injunction Injustice was started by people who have previously taken action with Just Stop Oil but who are now banned from participating in Just Stop Oil actions by draconian bail conditions. A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said “More and more ordinary people understand what these lawyers apparently do not and that is that no-one is safe from the consequences of runaway global heating. Your fat salary might give you a few months respite from extreme heat waves and mass crop failure, but in the end we will all see our children starve and have to face riots and war. “Why, then, are lawyers aiding and abetting our criminal government in persecuting ordinary people trying to protect humanity when we should all be working together to deal with the impacts of climate breakdown and societal collapse? Lawyers must be responsible. Stop profiting from genocide” DLA Piper is an international Law firm that claims to have green credentials and yet they are the firm profiting the most from the civil law injunctions brought by the government against Insulate Britain, Stop HS2 and Just Stop Oil. Lawyers for DLA Piper charge the government between £90 and £412 per hour for their services, fees which the government then seeks to recoup from the people named on injunctions in the form of legal costs.  For example, lawyers acting for the government in respect of the National Highways Ltd M25 injunction originally sought costs of £727,574 against the 133 defendants. People named on injunctions are frequently faced with huge legal bills whether or not they broke the injunction. [2] In addition to legal costs running to tens of thousands, those convicted of breaking an injunction face up to 2 years in prison, an unlimited fine and seizure of assets. Many of those in court this week have already spent long periods on remand, experienced restrictive bail conditions and ankle tags and, in an apparent case of double jeopardy face trial for public nuisance in criminal courts in 2024/5.

"71","Seven Just Stop Oil supporters found ‘not guilty’",2023-12-06,"Seven Just Stop Oil supporters have been found ‘not guilty’ for willful obstruction of the highway. The supporters are demanding that the UK government immediately halt all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] Appearing before District Judge Bone at Stratford magistrates court yesterday, a group of seven Just Stop Oil supporters were acquitted for disrupting traffic at St George’s Circus London on the 13th October 2022. District Judge Bone found that the action was  proportional under Article 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The defendants are Kate Bramfitt, Tommy Burnett, Gillian Leader, Ben Plumpton, Fiona Prior, Jane Thewlis and Thomas Adams. [2] One of those on trial yesterday, Ben Plumpton, a 69 year old retired grandmother from Hebden Bridge said: “It’s good to be acquitted for a completely peaceful action intended to pressure the government on the multiple disasters and huge numbers of deaths they will cause by allowing more oil and gas extraction. It’s time the real criminals were prosecuted, the ones knowingly and deliberately causing these disasters and deaths – the government ministers granting new licences and the fossil fuel executives prioritising profits over life.” Another of those on trial yesterday, Jane Thewlis, 60, a retired social worker from Bradford said: “My life’s work has been to look after people and I can’t bear to see the suffering caused by climate breakdown. People are being forced to visit food banks and unable to heat their homes. I have been seriously depressed to see this government add to their suffering while giving tax handouts to the wealthy. Just Stop Oil gives a simple message: no more oil and gas licences. Let’s start creating a world where we care for everyone!” Yesterday Phoebe Plummer (22), Ruby Hamill (19), and Chiara Sarti (24) were granted bail from HMP Bronzefield and HMP Wandsworth after almost 3 weeks on remand after being imprisoned, without trial, for marching in resistance to new oil and gas. There have been 670 arrests of Just Stop Oil supporters since October 30th. There are currently five Just Stop Oil supporters in prison, three of whom have been imprisoned, without trial, for peacefully marching in the road. They are Cressie Gethin (21), Noah Crane (18), Ella Ward (20). They join Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker, who have been imprisoned for over a year and were sentenced to 3 years and 2 years 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action. Fourteen Just Stop Oil supporters are currently under electronic tag surveillance. Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, at the expense of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist.

"72","Louise Harris’ new single “We Tried” becomes first ever climate song to reach UK iTunes No.1",2023-12-06,"With Chris Packham calling for it to be this year’s Christmas No.1, Louise Harris’s new climate single, “We Tried”, hit No.1 in the UK iTunes Singles Chart one week after its release, overtaking the likes of Dua Lipa and The Beatles. The climate anthem, also backed by Brian Eno and Christiana Figueres (Chief Negotiator of the 2015 Paris Agreement), immediately entered the Big Top 40 Chart from Global – announced No.27 on Sun 26th Nov and No.26 on Sun 3rd Dec. This is the first time a song about the climate crisis has achieved such popularity. Louise will be donating all proceeds to climate causes. Up until now, Louise was only known for being the Just Stop Oil protestor who filmed herself crying on top of a gantry over the M25, her emotional testimony going internationally viral this time last year. This protest led to Louise’s arrest, and she was remanded to prison for 8 days. She has now re-entered the public eye, however, with a powerful song and music video “about the climate crisis and what will happen if we don’t act”. She recently sang the song outside of Rishi Sunak’s house as part of a Just Stop Oil protest and was unexpectedly arrested. Now facing a suspended sentence, Louise has turned to music to express her grief, despair and anger at the escalating climate crisis and lack of appropriate action from governments. “We Tried” is deliberately written from the perspective of our currently projected future of irreversible climate catastrophe (“We ran out of time…oh well, we tried”). Louise hopes this song will allow people to feel how they would feel if this future happened – and then use that feeling to spur themselves into the only hopeful solution left: collective climate action. The powerful music video, which has already been shared by Chris Packham, Brian Eno, Adam McKay, Christiana Figueres and Dave Goulson, centres on a tear-stricken Louise and is interspersed with childhood videos, footage of politicians, climate victims and activist movements past and present. The emotive lyrics talk of an avoidable defeat: “Well, maybe we were meant to win… but not enough good drowned out the sin… they watched the world cave in”. The video fades to footage of Louise’s famous gantry action where she pleads through tears: “I’m here because I don’t have a future…Why does it take young people like me, up on a f***ing gantry on the M25, for you to listen?”. It ends with the message: “It’s not too late to avoid irreversible climate catastrophe. “There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all” (IPCC Report, March 2023). We have time – but not for long. Join collective action today.” Louise explains: “I wrote “We Tried” back in July 2022, three days after my 24th birthday, an age which children born today may never reach. The song expresses feelings of grief, anger, a longing to be taken somewhere else, and exhaustion at living in a world where you are constantly being gaslit – by the media, politicians, and, hardest of all, by people you love. The message of my song and video is this: The climate crisis affects me and my family, you and yours. Noone is exempt. It has been created by a few handfuls of people in power who, I’ve concluded, must not know what love is. But what matters is – I know what love is. You know what love is. We know. And together, we outnumber the people in power 8 billion times over. So what are we waiting for? We must come together, and act – not as individuals, but as a collective – through civil disobedience; protest; a mass movement. Can we truthfully say ‘we tried’? Where are all the songs and films and plays about this life-threatening emergency? Music and art have a unique power to move people emotionally, and empower them into action. Historically, they have been instrumental in bringing about social change, in sparking revolutions. It’s time to do it again. After all – if art can’t change the world, what can?” This climate anthem is just the beginning of Louise’s music activism journey, with plans to release an entire climate album in 2024, if she reaches her goal of £20,000. “It’s a beautiful song. It’s melodic. It’s ‘catchy’, it’s ’pop’, it’s ’sing-along’. It’s lovely, isn’t it…? No, it isn’t. It’s fucking horrific, terrifying and tragic. Listen to it, hear every desperate note, each lingering plea. Don’t just look at, see the pictures. Read the music, read the room, our planet’s youth in abject distress. This is their voice, their cry, their tears laid bare. So ask yourself: do you want this to be the ultimate anthem for doomed youth, a threnody for their funeral? It’s beautiful, beautiful for its razor sharp honesty, beautiful for its truth, beautiful for its purity of frightened heart. Please listen, please learn, please act”. – Chris Packham, Naturalist and TV Broadcaster “I often talk about facing the climate and ecological crises head on: not shying away from the pain and in fact using it to generate the clarity of what needs to be done. Here’s a young woman doing just that with this song: musician and activist Louise Harris. A powerful song. Thank you Louise.” – Christiana Figueres, Former UN Climate Change Executive Secretary & Chief Negotiator of landmark 2015 Paris Agreement “It is the young who will reap the global heating whirlwind that we have sown, but their voices are being ignored and their protests shut down at every opportunity. What better way than music for them to announce their fears and demands to a world that has to listen.” – Bill McGuire, Professor Emeritus of Geophysical & Climate Hazards, UCL “This beautiful and moving song is a powerful weapon. We need to wake up to the cowardly inertia of our governments, to the greedy shortsightedness of business-as-usual, and to the numbing distractions of the media. This song woke me up. I hope it gets centuries of airtime.” – Brian Eno, musician and producer","https://juststopoil.org/2023/12/06/louise-harris-new-single-we-tried-becomes-first-ever-climate-song-to-reach-uk-itunes-no-1/",2
"73","So what’s your theory of change? COP 28 or Just Stop Oil?",2023-12-05,"By Jonathon Porritt The waves of phoney positivity emanating from CoP28 in Dubai are making me feel sick. “Look at our shiny new Loss and Damage Fund”. “Marvel at the new Emirates Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture”. “Get your heads around new heights of rhetoric about the importance of addressing the methane challenge”. I hate to be yet another CoP grinch, but please hold on the champagne for a little bit longer. It’s taken decades for these three “breakthroughs” to land at a CoP – and their impact will be about as minimal as world leaders could get away with. Why? Loss and Damage Great to see the Loss and Damage Fund coming into existence – but the commitments promised (of around $400 million) are pathetic. Financial damage caused by climate change every year is already around $400 billion – 1,000 times as much, and rising every year. Abu Dhabi set out to set the right example, promising $100 million – precisely one-eighth of the profits generated by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in 2022. Sustainable Agriculture The Emirates Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture sounds great, but all that has been agreed (by 130 countries) is to include emissions of greenhouse gases in their official Net Zero strategies. But no targets, no agreement on priorities, and (perish this thought!) no proper recognition of the need massively to reduce meat consumption. Methane On methane, it’s now two years since the Global Methane Pledge was signed (at CoP26 in Glasgow). Not much has happened since then – in fact, emissions of methane have significantly increased! But don’t worry – we now have a new target to cut methane emissions down to “near zero by 2030” and to eliminate routine gas flaring. These new commitments were coordinated by ADNOC (the CEO of which is, of course, Sultan Al Jaber, moonlighting as CoP28 President), which is currently one of the worst flaring offenders anywhere in the world, despite lying through its teeth for years that it had already eliminated all flaring from its facilities. I set out yesterday to manage my nausea by catching up on news of the latest Just Stop Oil protests, including a protest outside Rishi Sunak’s West London home last Wednesday, and a protest outside the Scotland Yard on Saturday, with campaigners pointing out that the Met would be better off going after the criminals in oil and gas companies (and their investors) than arresting Just Stop Oil campaigners as soon as they step into the road – or, in the latest development, while they’re still walking along on the payment! So let’s compare and contrast: on the one hand, more than 80,000 government and business delegates (plus a few hundred “representatives of civil society”) doubling down on yet more bleeding blah-blah in Dubai; on the other hand, more than 660 Just Stop Oil protestors arrested over the last few weeks – with 6 young Just Stop Oil supporters imprisoned for marching without having even been convicted. One thing to bear in mind here: outside of our little climate bubble (that’s you, me and a few hundred thousand people), CoP28 will come and it will go without impacting in any way whatsoever on the vast majority of people in the UK. (CoP26 in Glasgow was a bit of an exception and got a lot of traction as the media bigged it up big time – what with it being here in the UK and all that!) The only outcome from CoP28 that would get massive media attention would be a firm agreement to phase out (not phase down) our use of fossil fuels within a fixed period of time. The chances of that are close to zero. In the meantime, Just Stop Oil is getting a lot of attention. It’s just published some new data showing the number of media mentions that environmental NGOs have generated this year, set against the amount of funding that they’ve received. So, the £680 million of funding for the National Trust generated 54,500 mentions; £3.1 million for Friends of the Earth – 43,100 mentions. The £1 million raised by Just Stop Oil generated a mighty 137,000 mentions. That’s pretty good value for money. It’s only fair to say that a lot of those mentions will have been negative; the UK’s predominantly right-wing media continues to wage war on Just Stop Oil, portraying them in the worst possible light – as “eco-fascists”, “ideological zealots” (a term now much loved by Rishi Sunak!), and a threat to democracy and the rule of law. Just Stop Oil is certainly challenging certain aspects of the rule of law, breaking laws in order to highlight the Government’s own reckless and deeply immoral disregard for the rights of citizens today and tomorrow. In so doing, however, Just Stop Oil is acting as a more clear-sighted, courageous defender of democracy than any political party – with the honourable exception of the Green Party. The defence of democracy and the defence of everybody’s right to a stable climate now march hand in hand. Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"74","Young Just Stop Oil supporters granted bail 3 weeks after vowing to continue in civil resistance",2023-12-04,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters who were remanded after refusing to cooperate with the criminal justice system and vowing to continue in civil resistance following their arrest for slow marching were bailed today. Appearing by video link from Bronzefield prison, Phoebe Plummer and  Ruby Hammill, were granted bail by Judge Hales at Southwark Crown Court this morning, after nearly 3 weeks on remand. A further bail hearing is scheduled for 2pm today for Chara Sarti, 24, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, also remanded three weeks ago. Phoebe Plummer, 22, was remanded on 16th November after she pledged “I will continue to march while they continue to licence new oil, gas and coal.”  She has been charged with a Public Order Act 2023 Section 7 offence relating to interfering with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure. [2] At the hearing on 16th November Phoebe said: “How many more children have to die before you listen? How many more floods have to wipe out entire villages? How many people will die before you stop sending people like me to prison? Sir Mark Rowley has been handed a dossier of evidence. Why won’t you investigate the real criminals?”” During the hearing this morning, the prosecution argued that Phoebe Plummer should not be bailed because of her history of breaking bail and frequent arrests. However, the defence argued that the Bail Act is clear: when there is no real prospect of a custodial sentence, bail should be granted. As yet there are no sentencing guidelines for Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, but they argued,  it is hard to see how slow-marching in a road for no more than 30 minutes would lead to a custodial sentence. Judge Hales concluded that while he concurred with the prosecution in respect of the likelihood of Miss Plummer reoffending, he was bound by the Bail Act. Phoebe was released on bail with the condition that she is not to organise or participate in any procession or static assembly in any road within the M25. ‘Road’ includes pavement and any interference with pedestrian traffic. Her trial was set for 17th February 2025. Ruby Hammill, 19, from South London, was remanded to HMP Bronzefield on 16th November after breaking bail conditions not to protest and vowing to continue in civil resistance if released.  She has also been charged with a S7 Public Order Act offence.[3] Before being remanded in November she said: “We are on course to lose all we know and love. Elsewhere, young people my age face torture for their peaceful resistance to a much more present threat. Our weird, fascist government is indifferent. Our demand is a no-brainer.” This morning the prosecution argued against granting bail to Ruby as they alleged that she has committed three offences whilst on bail and would immediately repeat the offences if granted bail. The defence argued that Ruby is only 19 and is of good character but had no legal representation at the previous hearing.  The Judge stated that bail was refused in the lower court because of Miss Hamill’s history of breaking bail and that he concurred with the prosecution, but was again bound by the Bail Act. Ruby was released on bail with the condition that she is not to organise or participate in any procession or static assembly in any road within the M25. ‘Road’ includes pavement and any interference with pedestrian traffic. Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, at the expense of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist. It is the will of the overwhelming majority of people that we take the actions necessary to ensure our survival and together we can make it happen. Our government is waging war on its people, and we’re fighting back. They’re the real criminals – imprisoning peaceful people for taking proportionate action to protect their communities, whilst licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects, which will destroy everything we value. We’re coming together to demand an end to new oil and gas. It’s not a case of ‘if’ we will win; but ‘when’.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/12/04/young-just-stop-oil-supporters-granted-bail-3-weeks-after-vowing-to-continue-in-civil-resistance/",3
"75","Just Stop Oil students march to demand the real criminals are charged with genocide",2023-12-02,"Just Stop Oil students and other supporters are marching from New Scotland Yard today in solidarity with political prisoners remanded for slow marching in recent weeks. They are calling for political prisoners being held for nonviolent climate protest to be freed, and for the climate criminals responsible for new oil and gas to be charged with genocide. [1] At around 12:00pm today, a crowd of around 80 Just Stop Oil supporters gathered at New Scotland Yard, where they heard testimonies from young political prisoners who have been imprisoned for demanding that the government take basic steps to protect the population by ending new oil and gas. There are six Just Stop Oil supporters under the age of 25 currently imprisoned for marching, without having even been convicted. Before the march even started, the Metropolitan Police arrested two Just Stop Oil supporters. At least 63 police officers and 18 police vans are accompanying the march. The march stopped at The Supreme Court, before going on to the Crown Prosecution Service headquarters where the marchers are staging a sit-down outside the entrance. It’s expected to finish at Buckingham Palace. One of those arrested before the march could even start today was Daniel Knorr, a biochemistry student from Oxford who said: “I feel an intense amount of responsibility at this time, I have confronted the reality of my future head on. This leaves me with no choice but to try and stop this from happening by any means necessary. The British government is advised by some of the best scientific minds in the world, which have unequivocally told them that they have a matter of years left to avert total catastrophe. Continuing to licence oil and gas with this knowledge is nothing less than the intentional murder of hundreds of millions at a minimum. The correct response to what is happening is to stop it no matter what, placing your body and freedom in the way if necessary.” There are currently eight Just Stop Oil supporters in prison, six of whom have been imprisoned, without trial, for peacefully marching in the road. They are Cressie Gethin (21), Noah Crane (18), Ella Ward (20), Ruby Hamill (19), Chiara Sarti (24), and Phoebe Plummer (22). Before she was imprisoned, 19 year old Ruby Hamill said: “We are on course to lose all we know and love. Elsewhere, young people my age face torture for their peaceful resistance to a much more present threat. Our weird, fascist government is indifferent. Our demand is a no-brainer.” They join Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker, who have been imprisoned for over a year and were sentenced to 3 years and 2 years 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action. Thirteen Just Stop Oil supporters are currently under electronic tag surveillance.There have been 667 arrests of Just Stop Oil supporters since October 30th.  [4][5][6][7] Just Stop Oil’s fundraiser has currently raised £56,000 in the last 48 hours and until 10am tomorrow (3rd of December) donations to the fund will be doubled by a group of generous donors, including Chris Packham. Chris Packham said: “Alarm bells are ringing! Good! – the world’s leaders are sleep-walking to oblivion, it’s time they woke up to their responsibilities and found the sense and courage to actually lead us towards environmental stability and recovery.” Just Stop Oil is primarily funded by small donations from members of the public.

"76","Just Stop Oil medics march as Just Stop Oil fundraiser takes off",2023-12-01,"Just Stop Oil supporters are coming to the end of their fifth week marching to the point of arrest. They are demanding that the UK government immediately halt all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] At around 12:30 pm today, a group of seven Just Stop Oil supporters, including a group of medics, began marching on the pavement from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. The group entered the road at Parliament Square and all were arrested by 12:55 pm. Just Stop Oil’s fundraiser is currently taking off, raising over £32,000 in the first 24 hours. From now until 10am on the 3rd of December, all donations to the fund will be doubled by a group of generous donors, including Chris Packham. Chris Packham said: “Alarm bells are ringing!

If you would like to donate to Just Stop Oil and have your contribution doubled, please donate here. [2] One of those marching today is Dr Alan Heath, a life scientist. He said: “I need to do this for my nieces and nephews, all young people and future generations. The UN and all the world’s climate scientists say we are headed for disaster. There must be no new oil and gas. History has shown us time and again that civil disobedience is how normal people win necessary change. Sir David Attenborough is warning us that collapse is on the horizon. Latest reports say this could be in less than 20 years time. We must act.” Another of those marching today is Alice, a women’s health doctor from London, who said: “I am marching in solidarity with the countless young people who have been arrested and imprisoned for being among the few people willing to tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency. The climate crisis is an escalating health crisis and our government seems content to sit back and watch hundreds of millions suffer and die rather than take appropriate action now.” Also marching is Stephanie, who works as a nurse. She said: “As a mother and a nurse, I have a moral and professional responsibility to now engage in nonviolent direct action to resist the inaction by our Government on the Climate Crisis. I must protect my children and patients so that’s why I am marching today.” Just Stop Oil has issued an open call to the public and to all concerned parties to march together in defiance of this criminal government. This has been inspired by demonstrations in the Netherlands, where repeated road disruptions and continued pressure on the police, has forced the Dutch parliament to vote to end fossil fuel subsidies.

HMP Pentonville refused Chiara to contact her lawyer. Hodge Jones and Allen solicitors had been attempting to contact Chiara at HMP Bronzefield, assuming she has been sent to a women’s prison, however as Chiara is trans she has been sent to male prisons.

"77","“You’ve given us a problem”",2023-11-30,"Taking Action with Just Stop Oil Mum’s March by Gill Tavener I knew, without a doubt, that this was going to be one of the stranger days of my life. Sitting in the Woman’s Hour studio at the BBC’s Broadcasting House, the only thing between me and Emma Barnett’s alabaster face was a huge red microphone, about the size of the heart thumping in my chest. It was one of those moments when you ask yourself, ‘How on earth did I get here?’ Three days earlier, I’d been agonising over a Mums’ March, as part of Just Stop Oil’s November actions. What would be the point, of dozens of brave mums, grandmothers and even a great grandmother accepting arrest as a consequence of slow marching, if nobody knew about it? That same day, serendipity led to a discussion with the producer of Woman’s Hour and a booking for two Marching Mums to feature on their 6th November broadcast; the morning of our march. The interview was scary but fine. Unpolished, we spoke from the heart about our fears for our children’s futures and our fears of our first arrests. As we left the studio, the producer said, ‘You’ve given us a problem’. She explained that BBC ‘balance’ demands that Emma should read an equal number of negative and positive comments from listeners at the end of the feature. Their problem? They had been inundated with support for us and couldn’t find a single negative comment. A good result, we felt. As we left the studio, staff applauded and wished us luck. That night, after release from a police cell, I found a message on my phone: listeners had been contacting the programme, asking how we’d got on and whether we had been arrested. While we were on air, the other Marching Mums, gathered in a room on the other side of London, listened to the broadcast. When we walked in to join them, we were greeted by cheers. What a powerful group we were that day; united by love for our children, for all the world’s children, and empowered by the knowledge that together, we were going to take meaningful action. Friendships form swiftly when purpose and power are shared. At that moment, there was nowhere better to be. Slow marching with Just Stop Oil is always an amazing experience. The bonds of love and trust within a group form a defensive shield against the noise around us, and support from passers-by lifts us. A mothers’ march is all of this multiplied by 10. Instead of orange banners, each of us carried a placard. We wanted to challenge the media’s ignorant stereotyping of Just Stop Oil marchers; to shake things up. For many of us, this would be our first arrest. The police arrived soon after we left Trafalgar Square, but there weren’t enough of them to arrest us all; ’You’ve given us a problem’, said one officer. Those of us still free continued to march. To have left the road simply because they asked us to do so would have equated to saying ‘Oh, we’re so sorry we dared to speak out for our chidren’s future; we’re so sorry we had the audacity to oppose fossil-fuelled greed with maternal love; we’re so sorry we tried to be heard’. So, no  – we couldn’t and wouldn’t leave the road until forced to do so. On the whole, our experiences of the Met Police were positive. You have ample opportunity for conversation during the extended processes of arrest and custody. Most of us reported later that police voiced support for our aims, if not always for our methods. Not all protesters are treated so well, but police really don’t want to be arresting us. Just Stop Oil has indeed given them a problem. I have two very clear memories of that afternoon. The first is lying on Whitehall’s pavement awaiting police transport. Staring at the small clouds in the vast blue sky, I thought about the world and its beauty, about how there was so much to fight for, and about how bizarre it was that I and over twenty other mothers should be lying in the middle of London, arrested for asking our government to stop threatening our children’s survival. Right there, right then, I felt I was where I needed to be. The second memory is sitting alone in my cell, quietly contemplating the secure metal door with its letter-box slit through which officers occasionally talked to me or gave me food. Right here, right now, I thought, I am my authentic self, acting in accordance with my moral, intellectual and visceral understanding of the world’s realities; my actions that day had been entirely consistent with my values and beliefs. How strange to feel so liberated in a locked cell. The return to ‘normal’ life is awkward. Friends want to know and don’t want to know. A chasm has opened between me and some of them, while a bond is growing with others. It’s hard to sink back into the opiating busy-ness of daily life. During my action-week, adrenaline, shared purpose and mutual loving care created an intense, concentrated enjoyment. Back home, the horrific realities of the climate catastrophe have crowded in again, and court notices in the post remind me of the potential legal consequences of my actions, but I have no regrets. I feel, more intensely than ever, deep gratitude for Just Stop Oil’s ongoing legal and emotional support and the iron-strong friendships forged in the furnace of action. Many have been and are still being braver than me and have their own stories to tell. Many others  find non-arrestable roles of great value within the movement. If you’re thinking of stepping forward, there are many ways to do so. Sign up at www.juststopoil.org and we’ll be in touch to discuss what you’d like to do. There’s a place for everyone; there is definitely a place for you. Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030.

And I’m marching in solidarity with the six young people – only a few years older than my sons – who are currently being held in prison. Our children deserve better.” “Everything that we are too selfish and cowardly to do now, they will have to do when their generation comes to power, by which time they will be presiding over a world scarred by our inaction. My conscience will not allow me to sit this one out. But it is not me who is engaging in criminal activity: the real criminals are at the conference table at COP, selling out the lives of our children for their profit. Not in my name.” Another of those marching today Rowan Tilly, 66, a human ecologist from Bristol, said: “We are small in number yet we march slowly onward to obstruct business as usual.  We trust that our lack in numbers will be made up for by the depth of our commitment and the fullness of our intention. Caring is radical beauty. Will you dare to let yourself be invited?” Just Stop Oil has issued an open call to the public and to all concerned parties to march together in defiance of this criminal government.

"79","If you do send me to prison, I shall go with pride",2023-11-30,"On Thursday the 23rd of November, Christopher Ford, 46, a nursery school teaching assistant, and father of two sons, was remanded to Pentonville prison for peacefully marching for two minutes in the road near Trafalgar Square. There are now 7 Just Stop Oil supporters imprisoned without trial for marching in the road. For the third time this month, Chris was brought before a Judge at Highbury Magistrates court, after being arrested on November 20th and charged with Wilful Obstruction of the Highway. In the dock, Chris refused to comply with the court, vowing to listen “to the voice of conscience” and continue marching if released. Below is the statement made by Chris in court: My name is Chris. I’m a nursery school teaching assistant – or I was until austerity closed the nursery. My duties there were to provide one-to-one care for children with special needs. More importantly, though, I’m a father to two sons and I’m terrified for their future because of the climate crisis, because of our leaders’ inability to understand the science of climate change and their ineptitude to act upon it. Indeed, the parallels between this and the evidence Chris Whitty has given in the COVID inquiry this week are there for all to see. Yesterday, I was arrested, literally within seconds of starting my protest: it was, without exaggeration, under 5 seconds. For those 5 seconds, I’ve now been in custody for 20 hours. On Monday, I had a similar experience – about 1 minute protesting in Westminster, which led to 25 hours in custody. And three weeks ago, I protested in Parliament Square for around 15 to 20 minutes, which led to 52 hours in a police cell. This means that I have spent around 100 hours in custody for protesting for no longer than 25 minutes. Having been held for those 52 hours, I was then produced to court, where I was bailed with the condition not to enter London, our capital city and home to the seat of power. This was done in order to stop me protesting, which I believe breaks my human rights. I was represented by a solicitor that day, who I feel, unfortunately, did not challenge this properly. I struggled with this imposition for a week before emailing the court to explain why I would, in fact, be returning to protest. I have broken that bail condition twice now this week, but I have not done so from a lack of respect for lawful authority, but instead in obedience to the higher law of our being, the voice of conscience. Indeed, I would like to impress upon you that all my actions in protests have been out of conscience and a selfless concern for others. And that despite what loudmouth newspapers and even louder mouthed home secretaries would have you believe, myself and others within the environmental movement believe in the rule of law for a fair and safe society. Indeed, it is the fear of the breakdown of law and order due to the climate crisis that leads us to try our best to peacefully and democratically change the direction that our society is heading in. I talk about a breakdown of law and order due to climate change. This is the United Nations prediction and it doesn’t take much to imagine why. A change in our climate will lead to ecosystem collapse and crop failures, which will lead to food shortages, which will lead to conflict over dwindling resources, which will lead to a breakdown of law and order. We’ve already had a foretaste of this during COVID – people fighting in supermarkets over toilet paper, a breakdown of law and order just so that people could wipe their backside? What would it be like when there is no food? How extreme would it get when people cannot feed themselves or their children? I said just now that we wish to democratically change the direction society is heading through protest. I know the loudmouth newspapers and ignorant internet trolls would struggle with this concept, but as I’m sure the court knows, protest is a fundamental, necessary and most powerful tool that democracy bears. I’m not sure that they are being sincere, but you often hear politicians say the phrase ‘protest is a cornerstone of democracy’. We see in Parliament Square statues of Nelson Mandela, Millicent Fawcett and my personal hero, Mahatma Gandhi. They are venerated and upheld as defenders of democracy. So for us to be arrested in sight of these giants for emulating them and using their tactics, it smacks of hypocrisy. Although, of course, both Gandhi and Mandela ultimately won, in part, because of the prison sentences that they received. The recent raft of anti-protest laws that the government has introduced are a double smack in the face of our democracy. Not only have they all but banned protests, but they have forced these laws through using executive powers that no previous government would have dreamt of doing. They use these powers after the House of Lords has blocked them. Things truly have come to a pretty pass when it is our unelected House of Lords that are trying to protect our fundamental democratic right to protest. The fact that the government pushed laws through in this way rather shows their lack of regard for law and for the lawmaking process. Another example of their lack of regard may be the government’s COVID lockdown parties. But more recently, the government’s colours have shone through again last week after their Rwanda immigration policy was deemed unlawful by law courts. Their response has left many jaws hitting the floor, leaving the European consensus on human rights and other international agreements, and with the Conservative Party chair saying that the government should just ignore the judges, break the law and illegally fly immigrants out anyway. They have no respect for the law. Indeed, they are making a mockery of the law. They are making fools of lawmakers, fools of the law enforcers and fools of the law courts. If you let them, they’ll make a fool out of you too, forcing you to send peaceful, conscientious people to prison on remand for simply marching, protesting for a legitimate reason, protecting our loved ones and doing so outside of Parliament in the company of Gandhi and Mandela. You’ll look like a right fool, or worse, like an authoritarian monster who cares nothing for civil liberties, all because of these ridiculous, regressive laws brought on by successive home secretaries. When I marched yesterday, I knew I was running the risk of being imprisoned for up to three months. I don’t want to be. The very thought of going to prison scares the life out of me. I’ll be absent from my uncle’s funeral next week, will miss my nephew’s 10th birthday, miss Christmas, miss my mum’s 80th birthday and my son’s 20th. I don’t want to go to prison. But I am prepared to do this in order to shine a light on the loss of our democratic rights and to defend my children’s future in whatever way I can. And if you do send me to prison, I shall go with pride that I am in the same company as Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. But I’d rather you didn’t. I’d rather go to the funeral to support my mum and reminisce with my family about how my uncle would dress as Father Christmas each year. I’d rather spend Christmas with my elderly parents, especially as my father has the early stages of dementia, and we don’t know how many more years he has with us. I’d rather be with my sons as they transition into adulthood. I’m saying all this to try and show you that I’m not an extremist, an eco-terrorist, or an eco-zealot, as the Daily Mail and certain Conservative MPs call us. Boris Johnson called us uncooperative crusties. I’m neither uncooperative, nor am I crusty. I am, like many others in the environmental movement, a passionate and loving person who cares deeply for his family and what is morally right. To paraphrase Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary General, climate activists are not extremists. The real extremists are the governments and companies continuing with fossil fuel extraction. Our government is releasing over 100 new oil licences for fossil fuel extraction. They are putting profits before people. They are the extremists. It should be them in the dock here for endangering lives, profiteering on insecurity, and threatening our children. I’m just trying to do the right thing. And now, I’m hoping that you’ll do the right thing, too, Judge. I’m hoping you’ll decide that sending me on remand for three months is not proportionate for less than 30 minutes of marching in the very place where protest is celebrated. I’m hoping that you won’t let the government’s new laws make a fool out of you. I’m hoping you will release me, and with no bail conditions, because I do intend to carry on protesting for our future. But if you don’t release me, if you do remand me to prison, then you shall hand me the bigger victory, for then I shall join Gandhi and Mandela in prison. Although, of course, I wouldn’t hold myself to their level. At least I’d be in the same ballpark. Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK.

"80","Just Stop Oil stages ‘wide awake’ disruption outside Rishi Sunak’s home as funders offer to double donations",2023-11-29,"At 8:10 this evening, a group of around 18 Just Stop Oil supporters gathered outside Rishi Sunak’s home in Kensington, London, and made themselves heard by beating pots and pans. They are demanding that the UK government immediately halts all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] Carrying placards reading “COP Failure=Crop Failure”, “No rest for the Wicked” and “Arrest the Real Criminals”, the supporters sat and listened to speeches and a performance of the new single ‘We Tried‘ by Just Stop Oil supporter and musician, Louise Harris. Louise is notable for scaling a gantry over the M25 and delivering a tearful appeal for the UK Government to end new oil and gas. The ballad, with its tear-jerking music video, is becoming a runaway hit that has already peaked at Number 1 in the iTunes singles chart, and is climbing the Top 40 Global Charts. Chris Packham has called for it to be a Christmas number one. Around 40 Police and several territorial support vehicles arrived from around 8:30 pm. The police detained all the Just Stop Oil supporters under Section 50 of the Police Reform Act of 2002. Police requested names and addresses of attendees which were given. At around 10pm officers began arresting the supporters, taking 16 into custody. Pia Bastide, 29, is a community worker who was present. She remarked: “People with flooded homes can’t sleep. Children dying from starvation can’t sleep. Communities staring down wildfires can’t sleep. So why should climate criminals like Rishi Sunak get a peaceful night’s sleep? Teenagers are being imprisoned for marching, without ever being convicted of anything. The Met Police should be targeting the real criminals – like Rishi Sunak, and all the oil barons striking slimy deals at COP28.” Dubbing the action a ‘Wide Awake’ protest, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “There should be no rest for the wicked. Rishi Sunak has already abandoned the promises he made to his own children on climate – he should have listened to them. New oil and gas is a sealed death warrant for the young and those who have done the least to contribute to this crisis. It’s disgraceful that an unelected Prime Minister should throw our futures away to squeeze out more profit for his fossil fuel lobbyist cronies. Any politician who has the slightest desire to represent the interests of the British people would immediately ban all new licences for oil and gas in the UK.” Meanwhile, a group of generous donors, including Chris Packham, is offering to double donations made to Just Stop Oil in the next 72 hours. Between 10am on the 30th November until 3rd December, all contributions made by members of the public will be matched pound for pound by the group. Chris Packham said: “Alarm bells are ringing! Good! – the world’s leaders are sleep-walking to oblivion, it’s time they woke up to their responsibilities and found the sense and courage to actually lead us towards environmental stability and recovery.” Just Stop Oil is primarily funded by small donations from members of the public. If you would like to donate to Just Stop Oil and have your contribution doubled, please donate here. There have been 657 arrests of Just Stop Oil supporters since October 30th. There are currently nine Just Stop Oil supporters in prison, seven of whom have been imprisoned, without trial, for peacefully marching in the road. They are Cressie Gethin (21), Noah Crane (18), Ella Ward (20), Ruby Hamill (19), Chiara Sarti (24), Phoebe Plummer (22) and Christopher Ford (46). They join Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker, who have been imprisoned for over a year and were sentenced to 3 years and 2 years 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action. [2][3][4][5] Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, at the expense of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist. It is the will of the overwhelming majority of people that we take the actions necessary to ensure our survival and together we can make it happen. People are marching every day from Trafalgar Square at 12pm, to bring an end to new oil and gas. On Saturday 2nd of December we will be hosting a mass march, starting 12pm at New Scotland Yard. Our government is waging war on its people, and we’re fighting back. They’re the real criminals – imprisoning peaceful people for taking proportionate action to protect their communities, whilst licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects which will destroy everything we value. We’re coming together to demand an end to new oil and gas. It’s not a case of ‘if’ we will win; but ‘when’.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/29/just-stop-oil-stages-wide-awake-disruption-outside-rishi-sunaks-home-as-funders-offer-to-double-donations/",3
"81","Judge finds Just Stop Oil Ritz roadblock was lawful in face of climate crisis",2023-11-29,"Four Just Stop Oil supporters were acquitted of obstruction of the highway on Monday after a Judge declared they had a lawful excuse for their actions. The four supporters had taken part in a roadblock at Piccadilly on 26th October 2022 to demand that the government halt all licensing and consents for the development of any new fossil fuel projects in the UK. [1] Clara O’Callahan, Ella-Rose Paez, Julia Redman and Bethon Roberts appeared before Judge Bone at Stratford Magistrates Court on Monday 27th November, accused of wilful obstruction of the highway in relation to peacefully blocking Piccadilly near Green Park Tube station last October. [2] Finding no evidence of ‘significant disruption’ Judge Bone delivered a not-guilty verdict. Addressing the defendants the Judge commented that the ‘issues’ being protested about were of high importance to the public. One of those acquitted on Monday, Clara O’Callaghan, 20, Cybersecurity student in Edinburgh, said: “I took action with Just Stop Oil a year ago to peacefully protest the government’s genocidal actions in granting more licences. Regardless of the outcome of this trial, the truth is clear – new oil and gas is genocide. In the last year, thousands have died in climate-related extreme weather events. How many more people will be forced to suffer in the next year, and the next? When politics is broken, I believe it is a moral obligation to continue in civil resistance against a genocidal government.” Also acquitted Monday, Julie Redman, 72, grandmother, said: “I am 72 and have 7 grandchildren. I have never had to face threats to life, but as the climate catastrophe unfolds I am haunted knowing they shall face droughts, wildfires, floods, famine, storms, war and may be forced to flee their homes as the climate catastrophe unfolds. I want to be able to tell my grandchildren that I did everything I could to prevent this catastrophe. “ Monday’s not guilty verdict follows the acquittal earlier in November of nine other Just Stop Oil supporters in relation to the same roadblock. On the 22nd of November, Adrian Johnson, Sarah Ath, Rosie Bowyers and Daniell Cole were also acquitted by Judge Bone at Stratford Magistrates court on the basis that a conviction would be disproportionate. In a defence statement, Adrian Johnson, 57, former Deputy Headteacher from Highland Perthshire said: “I have been brought to court today, but it is the real criminals who should be in the dock who are licensing and promoting new oil and gas. The MET police have been given overwhelming evidence of government crimes against humanity and of genocide yet still refuse to investigate them, while prosecuting ordinary people like myself”","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/29/judge-finds-just-stop-oil-ritz-roadblock-was-lawful-in-face-of-climate-crisis/",3

They are demanding that the UK government immediately halt all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] At around 12:35 pm today, two Just Stop Oil supporters began marching on the pavement from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. The two entered the road outside Downing Street and were immediately arrested. Just Stop Oil has issued an open call to the public and to all concerned parties to march together in defiance of this criminal government. This has been inspired by demonstrations in the Netherlands, where repeated road disruptions and continued pressure on the police, has forced the Dutch parliament to vote to end fossil fuel subsidies. [2] A Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “This past couple of weeks we have seen Just Stop Oil supporters repeatedly arrested in seconds for attempting to march near parliament. Such is the nature of freedom of speech and the right to protest in the UK in 2023. We have sleep-walked into a police state. Our politicians have been bought by big business and the oil lobby, and the police and courts are complicit in enabling the criminals in charge to sign our death warrants by licensing new oil and gas.” “In the face of oncoming societal collapse, which will be brought about through widespread crop failure, Just Stop Oil supporters will not be bullied out of taking necessary and proportionate action. Our leaders have gone completely off the rails. We will not comply with a system that is destroying our entire way of life and everything we value. Police- it’s time you stopped arresting grandmothers and started arresting the real criminals in government.” One of those marching today, Julie Redman, 72, a grandmother of seven from Fife, said: “I’m in despair about the climate crisis. It is accelerating at an alarming pace and yet our government is still giving out new licences for oil and gas. It is my grandchildren who will bear the brunt of climate breakdown and I want to be able to tell them that I did everything I could to prevent climate catastrophe.” Yesterday six marched at Parliament Square and were immediately arrested. Four of these have been held for court and will appear at Highbury Magistrates today. There have been 639 arrests of Just Stop Oil supporters since October 30th. There are currently nine Just Stop Oil supporters in prison, seven of whom have been imprisoned, without trial, for peacefully marching in the road. They are Cressie Gethin (21), Noah Crane (18), Ella Ward (20), Ruby Hamill (19), Chiara Sarti (24), Phoebe Plummer (22) and Christopher Ford (46).

They are demanding that the UK government immediately halt all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] At around 12:30 pm today, a group of six Just Stop Oil supporters began marching on the pavement from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square. One of their number was immediately arrested. The remaining five were arrested as soon as they entered the road in Parliament Square. Just Stop Oil has issued an open call to the public and to all concerned parties to march together in defiance of this criminal government. This has been inspired by demonstrations in the Netherlands, where repeated road disruptions and continued pressure on the police, has forced the Dutch parliament to vote to end fossil fuel subsidies. [2] One of those marching today is Xandra Gilchrist, 72, a retired social worker, mum and grandma, from Leamington Spa. She said: “I’m taking action for my wonderful daughter, my eight year old grandson and for all our futures. As a social worker, I’ve worked in child protection, fostering and adoption services for over 45 years. Now, with undeniable scientific evidence of the disaster of climate breakdown that we can see with our own eyes, and the political complicity that has brought us to this point, l realise I need to take action to protect all our children like never before. This is why l’m taking action with Just Stop Oil and you should be too.” Also marching today is Margaret Reid, 52, a shop assistant from Kendal, who said: “We are at a moment of existential crisis, hurtling towards disaster. However, instead of stopping the new oil and gas that is killing us, our government is intent on locking up teenagers and silencing dissenting voices for simply asking the government to take basic steps to protect the population of this country. The metropolitan police and the judiciary are supporting them in this, as we slide into dangerously authoritarian territory.” “Are our futures safe in any of their hands? No. I am directed by my conscience, not by absurd and draconian rulings from a complicit judiciary. And that conscience tells me not to stand by in this time of crisis, and watch unscrupulous politicians destroy everything we love. I will not be silenced and I will not be intimidated.” Today’s march comes after an analysis carried out by researchers from the universities of Bournemouth, Exeter and Sheffield, has revealed that more extreme and unseasonal weather, driven by climate breakdown, has accounted for one-third of all food price inflation in the UK this year. Combined with the impact of soaring energy prices – after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove up gas, energy and fertiliser prices. The report states that British households had been hit by £605 in additional food costs in 2022 and 2023. While energy prices have fallen back this year, the report warned that the impact from the climate emergency was increasing. The report highlights the necessity to transition the UK’s energy systems to renewables as soon as possible, to insulate the country from energy price spikes and to reduce carbon emissions.

[1] At around 12:00 pm today, a group of 5 Just Stop Oil supporters began marching on the pavement from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square. They were followed by approximately 30 Metropolitan Police Officers. When they arrived at Parliament Square, the group were arrested while at a pedestrian crossing that was green. One of their number, Callum Goode, had been arrested at Trafalgar Square earlier for breach of bail. At no point did any of them march in the road. One of those marching today and risking remand is Luke Watson, 34, a handyman from London. He said: “On Monday I was arrested for marching 2 minutes in the road. I’m here again today because I don’t want to be bullied. Protesting, freedom of expression and assembly are basic rights, rights we seem to have lost” “The UN has just said we’re on track for 3 degrees of warming and an unelected prime minister is going back on the environmental pledges that got his party elected whilst imprisoning young people for complaining about it. Aren’t you glad to live in a civilised liberal democracy?” Another of those marching today is Greg Sculthorpe, 38, an accountant from Doncaster. He said: “New oil and gas is incompatible with preventing the deaths of millions from heatwaves and crop failures. Our government is prioritising the shortsighted greed of fossil fuel companies over everyone else’s basic rights to life. You have to decide what kind of person you are: someone who stands up to evil or someone who just lets it happen. We aren’t powerless. We could force our government to act responsibly if everyone who is able to, joined in civil resistance to fight for their lives and everything they love.” Yesterday, news broke that 100 prominent figures including Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Ben Okri, and former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams signed a letter defending climate activists, such as the recently-acquitted HSBC 9. It insisted that “It is now incumbent upon all good people of conscience to rise up as these women have, to pull together and find our collective power”, while also lamenting that “Those standing up in defence of life on Earth are being criminalised by the UK legal system”, namechecking Just Stop Oil activists Morgan Trowland and Marcus Dekker. [2] At the same time, two octogenarian Just Stop Oil supporters staged an intervention at St. Paul’s cathedral, asking the congregation of a Thanksgiving service – ‘Will our children thank us?’. This disruption was well-received by the clergy, with Reverend Jennifer Mills-Knutsen, remarking: “parade and protest, praise and petition are one in the same”.

My granddaughter is 11 and if they aren’t interested in protecting her then I have to step up. All grandparents and parents who love their kids need to join us on the streets – join us in Trafalgar Square every day from 12pm.” “Seven people died as a result of the extreme weather in the UK in October!

As the ladies took action, the reverend running the service, Reverend Jennifer Mills-Knutsen, said: “parade and protest, praise and petition are one in the same.” Over 20 city of London police were seen attending the scene, as the ladies were escorted out by security. Speaking before the action, they said: “Today, in St Paul’s Cathedral is the Thanksgiving service when Americans especially celebrate family life. But here in Britain, young people are being imprisoned for saying: “We fear for our future – will we be able to have families of our own?” Eight years ago, our governments pledged to reduce carbon emissions – but they, along with twenty of the largest oil producing nations, are now planning to increase oil and gas production. We are two women in our eighties who feel we must do whatever we can before we die to turn this around. Our young people need hope — but hope must be earned by action.

These emissions are shattering temperature records with June, July, August, September and October all the hottest on record. He warned we are on course for a ‘dead-end’ 3 degrees of heating above pre-industrial levels.

[1] At around 12:30 pm today, a group of approximately nine people began marching from Trafalgar Square in support of Just Stop Oil’s demand. All nine were arrested within 30 seconds of stepping on the road. Just Stop Oil has issued an open call to the public and to all concerned parties to march together in defiance of this criminal government. This has been inspired by demonstrations in the Netherlands, where repeated road disruptions and continued pressure on the police, has forced the Dutch parliament to vote to end fossil fuel subsidies. [2] One of those marching today is Mel Carrington, 63, a mum and former environmental consultant. She said: “As a mum I can’t stand by and watch while 18 and 19 year olds are imprisoned, without trial, for demanding a future. They have barely begun and yet their life chances are being snuffed out by the deceit and denial of self serving politicians and greedy fossil fuel execs. It breaks my heart.” “I’m afraid that organised society will unravel very quickly in the face of 3C of warming. We’re looking at crop failure, mass starvation and millions of deaths. I’m taking action with Just Stop Oil because I believe that civil resistance is the best chance we have of forcing the government to act.” Joining the march today in a support capacity, is sustainability campaigner, former Green Party and Friends of the Earth director, and writer, Jonathon Porritt. He said: “Just Stop Oil’s uncompromising position is wholly justified – morally and politically. Its central objective is crystal clear – and not even particularly radical. Unfortunately, the current UK Government has chosen to ignore the science, and has simultaneously trashed the UK’s reputation as a leader on the climate by doubling down on new oil, gas and coal investments.” “It’s pretty horrendous coping with all this at the age of 73, but it’s all but impossible for me to imagine how I would be dealing with it, psychologically, if I was still looking ahead to a long life ahead of me. I don’t think there’s any doubt that I would be joining with colleagues, of my own age, to take direct action – for many reasons, but primarily to keep despair at bay through taking that action.” [3] Yesterday, Cressie Gethin (21) and Noah Crane (18) were remanded to prison where they join Ella Ward (20), Ruby Hamill (19), Chiara Sarti (24), Phoebe Plummer (22) and Sam Griffiths (48), who have all been imprisoned, without trial, for peacefully marching in the road. [4][5][6] Yesterday Cressie spoke in court before she was remanded: “I will say that I have the greatest respect for the people in this courtroom as human beings, but I have a moral duty to remain in resistance given the scale of this crisis. Whatever the court decides to do I will remain in resistance. If given bail I will march again. If I am remanded others will march in my place.” [7] After yesterday’s march, seven people are currently held for court, a number of whom are potentially expecting to be remanded. There are currently nine Just Stop Oil supporters in prison, including Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker, who have been sentenced to 3 years and 2 years 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action. [8] Todays march comes as Mr Ian Fry, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the context of Climate Change, wrote to the UK government “regarding the arrest and severity of the sentences of Mr. Trowland and Mr. Decker in relation to their work as environmental human rights defenders”.  He stated that the sentences are “significantly more severe than previous sentences imposed for this type of offending in the past.” and continued that he was worried about “the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association”. [9] Speaking from prison, Morgan Trowland, sentenced to 3 years in prison, said: “The sentences given to myself and Marcus Decker demonstrate that our government is determined to protect those who are planning climate genocide. It’s people vs oil and our government has signalled that it is on the side of oil”. Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, to the detriment of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist. It is the will of the vast majority of people that we end new oil and gas and together we can make it happen. From 20th November the people are marching against oil every day from Trafalgar Square at 12pm. Our government is waging war on its people, and we’re fighting back. They’re imprisoning peaceful protestors, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns. We’re coming together to demand an end to new oil and gas, and it’s not a case of ‘if’ we will win; but ‘when’.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/21/just-stop-oil-supporters-march-for-30-seconds-as-un-criticises-severe-sentences/",3
"89","A week in resistance with Cressie",2023-11-20,"Sunday, 12th November It’s Remembrance Sunday in North London, a windswept afternoon with prickling bouts of rain. A group of 40 Just Stop Oil supporters are gathering on the pavement. The pedestrian lights turn green and they step into the middle of the road, donning the orange high-vis tabards which had been stuffed into backpacks and the pockets of cagoules. They begin marching down the road as car horns start to blare. Cressida Gethin is one of their number – or Cressie, to her friends. Cressie is 21 years old. She’s a music student. And after 30 minutes walking in the road, she’s cuffed by a Metropolitan Police officer. She’s allegedly breaching Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023 – a new raft of draconian anti-protest legislation that Amnesty International calls “draconian”, and the Economist says “goes too far”. [1] [2] At the moment of her arrest Cressie begins peaceful noncompliance. She’s slight in figure but this technique means that it takes a team of officers to drag her into the back of a police van. Back at the police station, she continues in resistance; remaining ‘floppy’, officers manhandle her in and out of a cell, manipulating her limbs to extract fingerprints. Monday, 13th November Cressie was held overnight in the cells, and in the morning she’s transported to Westminster Magistrates Court to be presented to Deputy District Judge Brown. The white poppy she’d worn yesterday is slightly creased now. But she refuses to leave the court’s holding cell to attend the hearing, where they’re expecting to hear her plea – guilty or not guilty. They’ll be waiting a while yet, as Cressie is remanded to prison. She’s sent to HMP Bronzefield, a category-A facility in Surrey. It’s the largest female prison in Europe, and the only private one in the UK. Brave acts of nonviolent resistance like Cressie’s are creating ripples that the courts aren’t able to ignore. Cressie and others who have stepped up into non-compliance are showing determined defiance of a system complicit in genocide  Tuesday, 14th November The authorities take Cressie to court once again, She remains in non-compliance, telling Judge Snow: “I do not wish to comply with the court’s questions, it should be real criminals held to account here not me” and sits down on the floor in the dock when he asks her about bail. She is released on bail, with conditions to not enter within the M25 . She’s collected from Westminster Magistrates court by friends and supporters, and taken home. Friday 17th November An early start today – by 9am Cressie is on the road in Whitehall, central London. Marching from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square, a group of students are taking a nonviolent stand against the Government’s genocidal climate policies. They don’t even make it so far as Downing Street, before a group of 50 police officers converge on their march and begin making arrests. Once again, Cressie refuses to comply – she is dragged from the road and left lying on the pavement in the pale morning sun while officers rush around detaining every single protester. Saturday 18th November Cressie is hauled in front of Judge Brown at Westminster Magistrates Court for the morning session. Their conversation goes like this: Judge Brown: What is your name? Cressie: All I can tell you is the truth: which is that the government continues to license new oil and gas which is killing millions of people. Judge Brown: Are you going to identify yourself? Cressie: All I can say is that the government is continuing to license new oil and gas which is killing millions of people. Judge Brown: If you won’t cooperate we will have to proceed in your absence. Cressie: The court can do what it likes with me. I will continue in resistance. I act with compassion. I will continue regardless, regardless of what the court does to me. Judge Brown: Are you going to cooperate with the proceedings? If not we will proceed in your absence and you will be taken downstairs. Cressie: I am in resistance, and I will not comply with the court. Crown Prosecution Service: I will be opposing bail, so it is your interest to cooperate with proceedings. Judge Brown: Are you going to cooperate? Cressie: I will not comply with the court. At this point, Cressie sits down in the dock. Judge Brown: Take the lady downstairs Security staff move to remove Cressie, but she refuses to comply by simply letting all of her limbs go loose. Judge Brown clears the court – Court 8 – so that the hearing can resume without Cressie in Court 7. Judge Brown: Where is she now? Crown Prosecution Service: She is still in the dock, she has been given time to reflect but still refuses to cooperate Judge Brown: The problem with this case is that Miss Gethin declined to cooperate. Anyway, she was disruptive, she spoke over me, and she still remains in the dock in court 8. She has voluntarily absented herself from these proceedings. We will continue as much as we can in her absence, but no progress can be made. No plea, no bail without cooperation, no case management. Judge Brown: I will remand Cressida Gethin, until Monday, when she will be produced, and I hope we can make progress, with case management, and a plea, and the question of bail can be considered. Cressie is returned to HMP Bronzefield for the rest of the weekend. Monday 20th November Once again, Cressie is brought from Bronzefield prison to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court. Cressie is being charged with Willful Obstruction of the Highway. In front of a Judge for the third time in just a week, Cressie vows to continue in resistance. Judge: Cressida Gethin, what do you plead? Cressie: The real question that should be asked is of the real criminals who should be in the dock. After some hours of deliberations, Cressie is able to deliver her closing remarks: Cressie: I will say that I have the greatest respect for the people in this courtroom as human beings, but I have a moral duty to remain in resistance given the scale of this crisis. Whatever the court decides to do I will remain in resistance. If given bail I will march again. If I am remanded others will march in my place. The judge remands her back to prison until the proposed date of her trial – 13th of December. Click here to see Cressie’s testimony of why she refuses to comply with a system of genocide. From 20th November the people are marching against oil every day from Trafalgar Square at 12pm. Our government is waging war on its people, and we’re fighting back. They’re imprisoning peaceful protestors, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns.

Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"90","Just Stop Oil supporters arrested after 2 minute march",2023-11-20,"Just Stop Oil supporters are marching to demand that the UK government immediately halt all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] At around 12:50pm today, a group of approximately 40 people began marching from Trafalgar Square in support of Just Stop Oil’s demand. Police warned the supporters that they would be arrested under section 7 of the Public Order Act before they entered the road and then proceeded to arrest many of them within 2 minutes of the march commencing. Also present were various YouTubers who were filming satirical videos. From today, Just Stop Oil has issued an open call to the public and to all concerned parties to march together in defiance of this criminal government. This has been inspired by demonstrations in the Netherlands, where repeated road disruptions and continued pressure on the police, has forced the Dutch parliament to vote to end fossil fuel subsidies. [2] A Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “In 2023, our choices to take action, or to not take action, have consequences. To not engage in civil resistance at this point in history is not a neutral act. Our government’s flagrant disregard for the rule of law and the wellbeing of the people of this country must be opposed if we are to claim we have any morality. The government would rather imprison teenagers as young as 18, simply for marching – something people have done for centuries. These are teenagers who are simply demanding that the government begin to take the necessary actions that would protect their generation. These are changes that the overwhelming majority of the people want to see, yet our politicians don’t deliver them because they are in the pockets of the fossil fuel lobby. From today, this is why people are joining us to march every day at 12pm from Trafalgar Square. To everyone who understands the severity of this crisis; it is your time to step up. Join us.” One of those marching today is Christopher Ford, 46, a nursery school teaching assistant and father of two sons, who said: “The United Nations are saying: ‘we are at a code red for humanity’. Our children’s futures are in danger. How, as a parent, can I stand by and do nothing? The government is releasing over 100 new oil licences against the advice of the United Nations, the International Energy Agency and even their own advisors, the Climate Change Committee.” “This shows how they have a total disregard for the climate, our futures and the lives of our children. Only together can we stand against this, so join us every day from 12pm at Trafalgar Square.” Today, Cressie Gethin (21) appeared in court, produced from Bronzefield prison, where she has been held since Saturday, after being arrested for marching and refusing to comply in court. She has now been remanded until at least the 13th December. Noah Crane (18), who announced to a large audience that he was breaking court bail on Saturday, is also due to appear in court later today. He may join Cressie, along with Ella Ward (20), Ruby Hamill (19), Chiara Sarti (24), Phoebe Plummer (22) and Sam Griffiths (48), who have all been imprisoned, without trial, for peacefully marching in the road. Roland Howes (19) a biology student, who marched twice with Just Stop Oil, was remanded to HMP Pentonville last week. On Friday, he should have been released on bail. Instead, he has been illegally held in prison due to ‘paperwork issues’. He is hoping to be released today. There are currently ten Just Stop Oil supporters in prison, including Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker, who have been sentenced to 3 years and 2 years 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action.

"91","‘It’s People vs Oil’ – Hundreds march to end new oil & gas",2023-11-18,"Hundreds are marching to demand that the UK government immediately halt all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] At midday today, a group of around 800 people gathered in Jubilee Gardens, near the London Eye and Shell HQ. Supporters from Just Stop Oil, Extinction Rebellion, Christian Climate Action, Peace and Justice Project and Fossil Free London as well as a number of other groups joined the march. Over 22 police vans were on the scene as people gathered. At around 12:35, after announcing that he was breaking court bail in a speech, Noah Crane (18) was dramatically arrested and carried away by police. The march set off at around 12:45pm via Blackfriars bridge and Waterloo bridge and is expected to finish in Jubilee Gardens at around 3pm. One of those marching today is Pippa Cowtan, 21, a politics and international relations graduate from London, who said: “The government cannot arrest its way out of the situation we are in, just like we cannot vote our way out. The time to get on the streets  is now. The government is on a path towards genocide and we have to stop them. No one else is coming to save us, we have to step up.” “I am taking action because I cannot sit back and be complicit in the government’s plans to let millions die, so they can further line their pockets. We have to come together to resist, because together we can be the opposition the country needs, and we can win.” Another of those marching today is Ella Taylor, 19, from Southampton. She said: “New oil and gas is murder. People in the global south are already being displaced or killed as a result of our government’s wilful ignorance. The science is clear, there is no excuse for ignorance.” “The problem seems insurmountable and I understand inaction out of fear. I feel that fear too, but if we allow our government’s genocidal policies to go unchallenged then we will face extinction on a global scale. There is no time left to waste when it’s all our homes and all our lives on the line, and I will not go down without a fight.” Yesterday, Ella Ward (20) was remanded to HMP Bronzefield for marching in the street. They join Ruby Hamill (19), Chiara Sarti (24), Phoebe Plummer (22) and Sam Griffiths, (48) who have all been imprisoned, without trial, for peacefully marching in the road.

"92","Two more defiant young people imprisoned without trial for demanding a future",2023-11-18,"In the last two days, two more brave young people have been remanded to prison after marching on the streets of London to demand a future. On Thursday, at Willesden Magistrates Court, Ruby Hammill, 19, from South London, was remanded to HMP Bronzefield after vowing to continue in civil resistance. Ruby was arrested and detained earlier in November and given bail conditions to stop protesting. She chose to continue to march. In court Ruby said that she would break bail conditions again if she was released so the Judge said they had no choice but to remand her. She is likely to remain in prison until her next court date on 14th December, but could face a sentence of up to a year for the new crime of “interference with key national infrastructure”. Before marching this week she said: “We are on course to lose all we know and love. Elsewhere, young people my age face torture for their peaceful resistance to a much more present threat. Our weird, fascist government is indifferent. Our demand is a no-brainer.” On Friday afternoon, at Highbury Magistrates court, another Just Stop Oil supporter was remanded to prison for slow marching in London, despite the Crown Prosecution Service recommending bail. Ella Ward, 20, a student at Leeds University was arrested on Thursday for slow marching. They were charged with Wilful Obstruction of the Highway, an offense that carries a maximum potential sentence of six months’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. The court heard that Ella had broken both police and court bail conditions that prohibited them from joining a slow march, but the Crown Prosecution Service did not recommend remand. They argued that the prospect of a custodial sentence for this offense was low and as Ella had no previous convictions they had no objection to bail. The Judge disagreed, saying to Ella: “As a general rule I rarely listen to defendants but speak to their solicitor, but in this case I need to be sure that you understand if you get bail, and get arrested you will be remanded. I now need to know if you are going to adhere to the conditions?” Ella responded: “I’m going to continue in resistance until the government stops committing acts of genocide.” Ella was remanded to Bronzefield prison, with Judge Brennon saying that they believed Ella would commit further offenses and that there was a real risk they would receive a custodial sentence if found guilty at trial. Ella will next appear in court via video link to Westminster Magistrates Court at 10am on 24th November, when a  second application for bail will be heard. Ella is committed for trial on 9th Jan 2024 at Stratford Magistrates Court. These are the people fighting to preserve your ever diminishing right to protest. These are the people sacrificing their liberty to push for the small, narrowing chance that we can bring things back from the brink and stop new oil and gas. How will you respond?

"93","“You can’t arrest your way out of this”- Just Stop Oil supporters march down Whitehall",2023-11-17,"Just Stop Oil supporters are marching towards the end of their third week, demanding that the UK government immediately halt all future licences and consents for fossil fuel exploration in the UK. [1] At 9 am, a group of around 20 mostly student Just Stop Oil supporters began marching at Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. By 9:30am all had been arrested, by a group of around 50 officers. One of those marching today is Alex De Koning, 25, an PhD Climate Scientist from Newcastle. He said: “There are more solutions to the climate crisis than I have time to tell you about. But with this criminal government in the driver’s seat on the highway to hell, there is only one solution that really matters: mass civil resistance. And deep down, you know that I am right. So what are you waiting for? We are in the middle of a crippling cost of living crisis and a chilling climate crisis. Yet, our insanely rich leaders are happy to continue to let us suffer in order to make themselves richer.” “What we do as scientists means nothing if the government is not willing to implement the solutions we already have. While they continue to subsidise the insanely profitable and criminal oil industry, everything else we do is just mopping up with the petrol tap open.” Another of those marching today is Matilda Denniston, 20, a politics student, from Brighton. She said: “I am marching today because new oil, gas and coal is a death sentence for the young and for the people already disproportionately impacted by the crisis today. I refuse to stand by and watch my government sign away our lives for profit. I’m marching with Just Stop Oil because everything that we know and love is on the line. I shouldn’t have to be here, nor do I want to be doing this, but I have no other choice.” Yesterday, at Highbury Magistrates Court three young Just Stop Oil supporters were remanded to prison for marching in the road. Ruby Hamill, 19, who will next appear in court on the 14th December. As well as Chiara Sarti, 24, and Phoebe Plummer, 22 who will next appear in court on the 30th November. [2][3] They were among 42 people who were held in police custody after marching on Wednesday. 37 of those arrested on Wednesday appeared in courts across London on Thursday where 33 were released on bail. In addition to the three remanded to prison, one person was remanded overnight to appear in court Friday. Five people from Wednesday’s march remain in police custody for a second night. Another 17 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested near Shepherds Bush on Thursday after marching in the road, bringing the total number of arrests since October 30th to 556. There are currently 28 people being held for court. In addition to the three people remanded yesterday, there are currently three Just Stop Oil supporters held in prison, including Sam Griffiths, remanded without trial and two who have now been imprisoned for over a year for nonviolent direct action. Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker have been sentenced to 3 years and 2 years and 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action. [4] A large uptick in the number of people being held for court combined with a lack of court slots means the police are now holding people illegally for days without seeing a judge. HMCTS is running extra court sessions from 4-8pm. The news has caused consternation among lawyers who have long-resisted Ministry of Justice attempts to introduce extended working hours beyond the usual 10 am to 4.30pm court day. [5] This week, the Metropolitan Police Federation warned that policing ongoing protests in London was becoming unsustainable, echoing events that unfurled in the Netherlands recently. Sustained blocking of the A12 motorway near the Hague inflicted so much pressure on Dutch police, that the government there was forced to negotiate with those blocking the road; eventually leading to the government voting to end fossil fuel subsidies.

"94","How many people will die before you stop sending people like me to prison?",2023-11-16,"This afternoon, at Highbury Magistrates court, another Just Stop Oil supporter has been remanded to prison for up to 6 months, for slow marching in London. Phoebe Plummer, 22, appeared before Judge McDonnell and was remanded to prison for marching on the streets of London at Earls court. Phoebe was charged with a Public Order Act 2023 Section 7 offence relating to interfering with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure. On Wednesday she marched alongside 66 other supporters of Just Stop Oil in London to demand an end to new oil and gas. In court Phoebe argued that not being able to protest in London would be an infringement on her right to protest, particularly in London where parliament sits. When the Judge asked Phoebe if she would continue to protest, she responded “I will continue exercising my human right to protest, yes” Judge McDonnell said that there were substantial grounds to believe Phoebe would continue to protest if released and ordered that Phoebe be remanded to prison for a maximum of 6 months. She will next appear in Southwark Crown Court on the 30th November to enter her plea. As the Judge remanded Phoebe to prison, Phoebe said: “I’m not going to walk out like that. I will continue to march while they continue to licence new oil, gas and coal. How many more children have to die before you listen? How many more floods have to wipe out entire villages? How many people will die before you stop sending people like me to prison? Sir Mark Rowley has been handed a dossier of evidence.

Chiara elected for a Crown Court trial, saying “I wish to be judged by my peers.” When asked to confirm their name, Chiara said: “The government is licensing over 100 new fossil fuel licences in the middle of a climate crisis” When asked to give their date of birth, Chiara said:  “I’m 24 years old – I was born after the first COP, I’ve been lied to my whole life. Emissions since then have risen year on year. We are being systematically lied to. I have the greatest respect for everyone in this court” The Crown Prosecution Service told Chiara : “On the 15th November, in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea you were slow marching, intending to interfere with key infrastructure” Chiara responded “ How many students will be sent to prison for marching down a road? How many mothers have to starve themselves in order to feed their children?” The court heard that Chiara was in breach of a recent condition from the court to not enter London as bound by the M25. When asked why they were in London, Chiara responded: “I am an ordinary person who has to take desperate action in these circumstances. I have a moral responsibility to be in civil resistance. I have a democratic right to protest. The laws I am being charged under – were written by an oil company – this is disgusting. The government should be in this dock, not me.” Chiara then lay down on the floor in the dock. The judge remanded Chiara to prison and said: “This court previously released you on bail – but clearly within 2 weeks you were within London. You have said to me today you have a moral responsibility to break laws in this country. I think you will break bail if released today.” The public gallery was cleared and 6 court staff entered to take Chiara away. Chiara will next appear in Southwark Crown Court on the 30th November to enter their plea. Speaking before slow marching this week, Chiara said: “The government is taking us for fools if they think we don’t see through their bullshit. Destroying our future is one thing, lying to us about it is another. We won’t let them get away with mass murder for the sake of greed.” Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"96","Just Stop Oil supporters march into cracks in the criminal justice system",2023-11-16,"Just Stop Oil supporters including students are once again marching to the point of arrest to demand an end to new oil and gas. [1] At 11:15 am, 17 Just Stop Oil supporters stepped into the road at the Holland Park roundabout near Shepherds Bush and began marching towards Kensington. Around 50 police arrived with a police helicopter at around 11:45. All are expected to be arrested however events are still unfolding. Yesterday, Noah Crane, 18, was remanded to Wandsworth Prison for marching to demand the government take action to protect his generation. He said: “We young people have been so conditioned into pursuing fancy degrees and careers above all else that we’ve forgotten to ensure those things mean anything. When I think about the situation we are in, I realise we are faced with a choice. Either we can sit back and watch the government commit mass genocide, or we can do everything in our power to prevent it.” Noah joins two other Just Stop Oil supporters remanded in prison for marching. Yesterday another 66 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested on Cromwell Road, bringing the total number of arrests since October 30th to 532. There are currently 25 people being held for court. A large uptick in the number of people being held for court combined with a lack of court slots means the police are now holding people illegally for days without seeing a judge. HMCTS is running extra court sessions from 4-8pm. The news has caused consternation among lawyers who have long-resisted Ministry of Justice attempts to introduce extended working hours beyond the usual 10 am to 4.30pm court day. The Criminal Bar Association told its members they are “not obliged to attend court out of hours”. Some law firms are intending to boycott the evening sessions. Failure for the legal system to process people in a timely manner may lead the way for potential false imprisonment claims. [2] A Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “What we see is a brazen disregard for the law in this country, the police ignore the law when it suits them, we have the Prime Minister ignoring High Court rulings, we have Home secretaries circumventing parliament to introduce legislation to ban the right to protest in this country. The cracks are showing, the emperor has no clothes on. The government can relieve the pressure on the police and the courts and end the disruption on London’s roads if they make a meaningful statement that they will halt all new oil gas and coal licences.” This week, the Metropolitan Police Federation warned that policing ongoing protests in London was becoming unsustainable, echoing events that unfurled in the Netherlands recently. Sustained blocking of the A12 motorway near the Hague inflicted so much pressure on Dutch police, that the government there was forced to negotiate with those blocking the road; eventually leading to the government voting to end fossil fuel subsidies. [3][4] One of those marching today is Grace Nicholls, 20, an Environmental science student from Manchester. She said: “I’m marching today and potentially risking a criminal record because I want to be able to use my degree in the future and if we don’t stop new oil and gas now, there’ll be nothing left to save. We are in a crisis and I can see no other alternative. I have to do everything in my power to protect my home and the people I love.” Another of those marching today is Poppy Bliss, 19, a student from Bury St Edmunds, she said: “I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I have been left with no other choice. New oil and gas is a death sentence for billions and a betrayal of the young. My generation, and all the generations after mine, are having our futures destroyed by the criminals in government who value profit over human lives.” “I’m 19 years old, it shouldn’t be up to me and all the others here alongside me to do this, but we are desperate. We have been utterly failed and I cannot stand by and watch as everything we love is threatened. It’s time to pick a side, profit or life.” There are currently five Just Stop Oil supporters held in prison, three remanded without trial and two who have now been imprisoned for over a year for nonviolent direct action. Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker have been sentenced to 3 years and 2 years and 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action. [5] Continued expansion of new oil and gas will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society and an end to the rule of law. We are not prepared to watch while the government continues to serve the interests of a few, to the detriment of everyone else. It’s up to all of us to come together and resist. It is the will of the vast majority of people that we end new oil and gas and together we can make it happen. 12pm, Saturday November 18th, People vs Oil, the people are marching as one. Our government is waging war on its people, and we’re fighting back. They’re imprisoning peaceful protestors, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects. We’re coming together to demand an end to new oil and gas. Meeting at Jubilee Gardens near the London Eye at midday.  [6]","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/16/just-stop-oil-supporters-march-into-cracks-in-the-criminal-justice-system/",3
"97","66 Just Stop Oil supporters march in defiance of new oil and gas",2023-11-15,"Just Stop Oil supporters including students are once again marching to the point of arrest to demand an end to new oil and gas. [1] At 10:36 around 66 Just Stop Oil supporters began marching South down Cromwell Road. Police were on the scene from 10:50, and began making arrests at 11:00. Lacking sufficient officers to arrest the marchers, the nonviolent march continued to 11:30 when officers themselves attempted to physically block the march, without success. Shortly afterwards, the remaining 15 marchers sat down. By 11:50 all supporters had been arrested. One of those marching today is Alfie Hewitt, 23, a Teaching Assistant from Sheffield, said: “I’m 23, and have realised that all chances of me or other young people having a normal future is being decimated by the government’s absurd pursuit of new oil and gas. It’s pure greed, and it’s the younger generations that will bear the brunt of it. Crop failure, food shortages, mass death. I cannot sit by and do nothing, inaction in 2023 is not a neutral act.” Another of those marching today is Connie Chilcott, 21, from Falmouth. She is a Politics and International Relations Student, who is getting arrested for the first time today. She said: “My studies often teach me about the power of civil resistance to bring about social change, but this degree is setting me up for a future that doesn’t exist. What is the point of a degree when food shortages mean my family can’t eat? This government is profiting off genocide, democracy is broken, it’s my duty to stand in resistance against this.” “When faced with the knowledge that millions of people in the Global South will experience the worst effects of climate breakdown, how can I do anything other than act? We have to stand together – our futures are being traded for the profits of the few. We can’t allow this to happen. I want us all to live long, fulfilling, and healthy lives, but we must act now. It’s people vs oil!” Yesterday, another 23 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested on Kennington Park Road, bringing the total number of arrests since October 30th to 466. There are currently 34 people being held for court and two are remanded in prison, without trial, for marching. Another two Just Stop Oil supporters have now been imprisoned for over a year for nonviolent direct action. They have been sentenced to 3 years and 2 years and 7 months respectively, in the longest sentences ever awarded for peaceful direct action.

"98","Just Stop Oil supporters march as Metropolitan Police Federation warns policing resources strained",2023-11-14,"Just Stop Oil supporters, including students, are marching today demanding an end to new oil and gas. [1] At 9:09 around 23 Just Stop Oil supporters stepped onto Kennington Park Road at the Oval in South London and marched north towards Kennington. At 9:16 the marchers left the road temporarily to allow traffic to pass after blue lights and a siren were heard. At 9:19 a lone officer announced that the march was in breach of Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023. More police began arriving, and at 9:22 officers began making arrests. By 9:30am all had been arrested. However, officers continued to struggle managing the Just Stop Oil supporters due to their peaceful noncompliance which saw them ‘go floppy’. Yesterday, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation warned that policing the daily Just Stop Oil marches and the weekly pro-Palestinian marches on Saturdays, was becoming unsustainable. He warned there is “no magic box of public order officers” the force could roll out to police the protests. [2] This echoes the events that unfurled in the Netherlands recently, where the police unions made similar warnings to the Dutch government that policing the daily road-blocks of the A12 road near the Hague, was unsustainable. After 28 days of sustained road disruption, the division between the police and government eventually forced a negotiation with the protestors blocking the road. This resulted in the government voting to end fossil fuel subsidies after awareness about the issue massively increased in the country, with 73% of the population saying they are now in favour of abolition. [3] One of those marching today is Thomas Dalton, 24, an electrician from Bristol said: “I am a tradesman, an electrician. The cost of renewable energy is far lower than that of new oil and gas. We as a society need to build a new way forward that ensures clean, cheap energy and meets the needs of its citizens.” “I am taking action due to the criminal negligence of our government. New oil and gas licences are not only a direct assault on the possibility of a livable future. They are also evidence of a government that doesn’t care for its most vulnerable people but only looks after wealthy donors and corporations destroying the world” Mairi Johnston, 20, an Astrophysics student from Manchester, taking action today, said: “I’ve had to make peace with the difficult fact that the future I’ve envisioned for myself doesn’t exist. I’ve been hesitant to do anything that jeopardises my plans, but there is no point in protecting that future if nothing changes. Taking action with Just Stop Oil is how I will protect it.” “Scientists are predicting we will have permanently breached 1.5C in 2030. Then we will be facing societal collapse, billions of people will be displaced, and the world will look nothing like it does right now. I will be 26 years old. Our government is responsible for genocide – it’s as simple as that. We are taking action because we don’t see any other option.” Yesterday over 110 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested at Hendon, bringing the total number of arrests since October 30th to 443. 10 people were held overnight and will be brought to court today. Cressida Gethin, 21, from London was held for a second night after refusing to attend a court hearing yesterday. She is expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court today. Cressie is refusing to comply until the police take action to prosecute the politicians and oil executives pushing for new oil and gas licences when they know it means a death sentence for millions in the global south. From 20th November, Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join us every day at midday in Trafalgar Square to march in London until the government comes to its senses and ends new oil and gas.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/14/15034/",3
"99","Metropolitan police overwhelmed by slow march of 100 Just Stop Oil supporters",2023-11-13,"Just Stop Oil supporters have continued their campaign of peacefully marching in the streets of London, to the point of arrest. They are demanding the government immediately halt all new oil, gas, and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 8:30am today, 100 Just Stop Oil supporters stepped onto the road and began marching at Hendon Way in North London. Today’s marchers include students from across the country as well as supporters from London. Metropolitan Police were immediately on the scene, with over seven vans of officers. They began arresting Just Stop Oil supporters as soon as they began marching for allegedly breaching Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023. However, the Metropolitan Police didn’t have enough officers to detain all of the Just Stop Oil supporters, so at least 70 have continued marching. Events are still unfolding. Today marks the third week of Just Stop Oil’s relentless campaign of slow marching in London. So far there have been over 300 arrests, with 132 Just Stop Oil supporters charged, and three remanded to prison. Yesterday, Just Stop Oil supporters held a march in North London in remembrance of all those who have died for this country, whose sacrifices are being betrayed by the Government’s genocidal policy of licensing new oil and gas. One of those marching remarked: “New oil and gas will destroy what my relatives suffered and died to protect” [2] One of those taking action today is Dr. Juliette Brown, a 53 year old doctor from London. She said: “Democracy doesn’t start and end at the ballot box. Whether it’s marching for a ceasefire in Palestine or taking action with Just Stop Oil, I feel driven to act by government policies that are threatening the lives of countless millions of ordinary people.” Also marching today is Taylor Collins, 19, a student from Southampton: “Politicians are making huge money by trashing our future with unsustainable oil and gas, corrupt lobbying, and prolonging the cost of living crisis with an addiction to fossil fuels.” The climate crisis has been worsening throughout my entire life. Politicians have failed to address it. This is a terrible hand for a 19 year old to be dealt. Young people will face all the consequences but none of the benefits of carbon capitalism. If I could, I’d change the policy right now. But by the time my generation will have any influence, it will be too late. This is my last resort.” We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas. From 20th November, Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join us every day at midday in Trafalgar Square to march in London until the government comes to its senses and ends new oil and gas.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/13/metropolitan-police-overwhelmed-by-slow-march-of-100-just-stop-oil-supporters/",3
"100","Just Stop Oil supporters march for peace and to demand the government protects all people",2023-11-12,"Just Stop Oil supporters including students are marching today to demand the UK government take basic steps to protect the people of this and all countries, by ending new oil and gas. [1] At 4pm this afternoon, 40 supporters of Just Stop Oil began marching south on Holloway Road, by Manor Gardens Street. Police arrived almost immediately and began shoving people out of the road. All were arrested by 4:40pm. One of those marching today is a recent graduate from Birmingham, Florrie, 22. She said: “My great-grandad fought in India during WW2, he was awarded the star of Burma medal and got shrapnel in his neck. My great-great grandad fought in WW1 and was killed in the Somme. His name currently lies in Edinburgh castle.” “I can only imagine what they would say about this government as they betray the people of this country and the whole world, by prioritising their own wealth and power over the wellbeing of all of us. New oil and gas will destroy what my relatives suffered and died to protect. That is why I am marching today.” Another of those taking action today, George Simonson, 20, a mechanical engineering student from London, said: “In an emergency we take action to protect the most vulnerable. That is what my relatives put their lives on the line for during WW2. If we aren’t taking action now, then we’re letting our government put millions of the most vulnerable people on earth to death. That’s what new oil and gas means.” “What the government is doing is a death sentence for my generation and I’m willing to be arrested and go to prison if there’s even a small chance of stopping it. I urge everyone to consider their position. Are we going to continue sitting on the sidelines? Or are we going to stand up like previous generations did when it was necessary to protect what we value most?” Last week 186 arrests of Just Stop Oil supporters were made at three marches on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, bringing the total number of arrests since October 30th to around 300. Slow marching Just Stop Oil supporters have racked up a total of 108 court appearances. Three supporters have been remanded to prison and seven have been released on a GPS tag. Six people who were arrested on Friday remain in police custody and are expected to appear in court on Monday.

"101","Over 300 arrests since October 30th: Civil resistance continues in the face of a criminally insane government",2023-11-11,"As experts call out the “insanity” of oil producing nation’s plans to blow the remaining carbon budget twice over,  Just Stop Oil supporters have continued their campaign of peacefully marching in the streets of London to demand an end to new oil and gas. This week 186 arrests were made at three marches on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, bringing the total number of arrests of Just Stop Oil supporters since October 30th to around 300. So far this week 78 supporters of Just Stop Oil have been charged with willful obstruction of the highway or breach of section 7 of the Public Order Act. Some 50 have been held in police custody to appear at Magistrates Courts across London and been subsequently released on bail. On Friday, Patrick Walker was released on a GPS tag to prevent him entering within the M25. Fourteen supporters remain in police custody and are expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Saturday. The courts are feeling the pressure as the volume of peaceful protestors being brought before them increases. There have been shortages of transfer vans, a lack of court spaces and people withholding their names in non-compliance. The police are going to extreme lengths to bring peaceful protestors before a judge, holding 14 slow marchers, arrested on Wednesday this week, for two nights in police custody. The courts of law remain a site of civil resistance. In defiance of the conditions imposed, many people marched again, breaching bail and risking prison. Others called out the complicity of the Judiciary. Appearing in court on a charge of Wilful Obstruction of the Highway after being arrested for slow marching on Wednesday this week, Callum Goode 24, said: “Regardless of the decision you make today, I will continue in nonviolent civil resistance against this genocidal government. If you send me to prison, I will continue in resistance. If you release me then I will continue to peacefully march regardless of any bail conditions you impose. If you give me a tag I will take it off, because if my moral responsibility to be in resistance conflicts with the orders of a judiciary that is complicit in genocide, then I must not comply with those orders. I must continue to act out of love.” Crown Courts Update Fat Cat lawyers left begging for crumbs? The case relating to the M25 gantry actions continued at the Royal Courts of Justice on Friday as Mr Justice Soole handed down his judgement on costs. The case involved the first group of 12 Just Stop Oil supporters who were sentenced on October 30th for contempt of court for breaking an M25 injunction. National Highways Limited (NHL) submitted evidence that showed total costs of £229,525 for the legal work involved in bringing the contempt of court hearing against the group, an equal share of which would amount to £19,127 per defendant. NHL sought to recover £58,800 from the group. After submissions from the defendants about the excessive nature of the claim, Judge Soole, declared that 80% of the claim divided equally between the 12 defendants would be the starting point for considering the cost burden for each defendant. He then announced that six of the twelve supporters, who had been found not to have had any knowledge of the injunction, prior to or during the action, would be spared costs. The remaining six supporters were awarded costs of between £3,000 and £5,000 depending on their individual circumstances. NHL will receive a total of £21,500 against their costs of £229,525. The outcome adds further weight to the argument that pursuing civil claims against nonviolent protesters is a waste of public money, particularly when those protestors already face draconian criminal penalties. 20 Insulate Britain public nuisance trials and counting.. Insulate Britain public nuisance trials have resumed this week, with four supporters appearing at Hove Crown Court for taking part in Insulate Britain’s 2021 campaign of nonviolent civil resistance undertaken to demand the UK government insulate Britain’s cold and leaky homes. Louise Lancaster, Nick Till, Stefania Morosi and Tim Speers were found guilty of causing a Public Nuisance after they blocked the M25 motorway at Junction 1A on the 15th September 2021. On Friday they were each handed prison sentences of 8 weeks suspended for 18 months, costs of between £900 and £3,200 and community service orders of up to 140 hours. Louise Lancaster, 58, a teacher from Cambridge said: “I am proud to have been in nonviolent civil resistance with Insulate Britain to save lives, stop families choosing between heating and eating and strive for a livable future for all.  The state ensured that our defences in law were ruled out, I call on the legal profession to push back against criminalising those sounding the alarm in this crisis.” At the start of the trial on Monday, people from the group Defend our Juries sat silently outside the court holding signs that say: “Jurors have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to their conscience”. The show of resistance from the group (which includes Quakers, doctors, athletes, professors and a former government lawyer) comes amid mounting concern jury trials are being increasingly politicised. After a series of acquittals have embarrassed ministers and politicians,  measures have been taken by Judges and lawmakers to render the role of jurors substantially meaningless, while preserving the appearance of jury trial. In the 20 Insulate Britain jury trials for public nuisance charges to date, four trials have resulted in a hung jury, two trials have resulted in acquittals, ten have resulted in a guilty verdict and three have been deferred. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has applied for retrials in the three cases where the jury failed to reach a majority verdict; the twelve people to whom this applies have been told to expect the retrials to take place early in 2024. The CPS has chosen to summon a total of 56 supporters to answer at least 201 charges of public nuisance across at least 45 jury trials, with additional retrials planned into 2024. These trials are planned to be heard across Inner London, Hove, Lewes and Reading Crown Courts and we estimate will take up at least 1,462 hours of court time at a cost of over £1 million.

They are demanding the government immediately halt all new oil, gas, and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 12:14pm this afternoon, 22 Just Stop Oil supporters from the North and South West of England and Wales began marching down Bow Road in East London. Metropolitan Police arrived at 12:17pm. By 12:30 they began arresting Just Stop Oil supporters for allegedly breaching Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023. All bar 2-3 supporters were arrested by 13:03. On Wednesday, officers of the Metropolitan Police were filmed using pain compliance techniques on nonviolent Just Stop Oil supporters. One of those who experienced these acts of violence was Alistair Glasse, a respected astronomer who worked for 20 years on the James Webb Space Telescope. [2] Yesterday, Sam Griffiths, one of a number of Just Stop Oil supporters who have been imprisoned for 28 days, without trial, for slow marching, shared a statement. An excerpt reads: “I am shocked how willing the police and the court are to embrace this authoritarian and repressive legislation. Where is their moral backbone? Who are they serving? And who do they protect?”  [3] Today marked the end of two weeks of slow marching. According to the Metropolitan Police, there have been at least 298 arrests this month, resulting in 98 charges . Four Just Stop Oil supporters have been put on a tag and two are currently held on remand in Wandsworth and Bronzefield prisons. 14 people have been held in police custody for almost 48 hours after being arrested on Wednesday. One of those taking action today is Sarah Moreis, a 58 year old shopkeeper and mum-of-four from Totnes. She said: “It is obscene that the government is putting short term profits over the future for our children.  They should be listening to the scientists, not the lobbyists who work for oil companies. Fossil fuel companies are paying dark-money think tanks like Policy Exchange, and it’s them who Rishi Sunak has writing their laws” “What will we do when flood waters ruin our homes and wreck our infrastructure? The only option available for normal people to be heard, is to cause disruption. We saw it work in the Netherlands, where the government there has been forced to end fossil fuel subsidies, and it can work here too.” Also marching today is Neil Brophy, 54, a grandfather from Leeds who said: “I am marching in response to government plans to issue over 100 new oil and gas licences.  I am angry at how this government has failed to address the catastrophe that’s killing people around the world. Without immediate action, the future of humanity is under threat. Soaring temperatures and adverse weather conditions are causing forest fires and flooding, killing countless people, and causing mass displacement of families.” “Historically, civil disobedience has always been the catalyst for essential change when governments have failed us. I can’t ignore the facts. We owe it to the children and young people who are facing a frightening future to act.” We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas.

I will be in here at least until my court date of November 30th. 28 days in total. Apparently we breached section 7 of the new public order act. I am shocked at how willing the police and the courts are to embrace this authoritarian and repressive legislation. Where is their moral backbone? Who are they serving? And who do they protect? It’s clear that they still believe we can arrest our way out of the climate crisis without actually taking any positive action to address the underlying issue. It is undeniable that new oil and gas will lead to needless, senseless death of hundreds and millions of people. It’s time for the police to investigate and prosecute the real climate criminals in government, banking, insurance, fossil fuel companies and the media. They are upholding the status quo, promoting new oil and gas, despite knowing what it will lead to. This makes them guilty of genocide by oblique intent. I am here because I acted out of love and fear. Love for everything I hold dear, and fear for what we will lose. Stand up. Be counted. Love Sam x” Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"104","Just Stop Oil supporters arrested for marching as police continue to facilitate the criminal acts of government",2023-11-08,"Just Stop Oil supporters are marching in resistance to the UK government’s plans to licence new oil and gas. [1] At 9am this morning, over 55 Just Stop Oil supporters from South Wales, the North, and the South West of England began marching around Waterloo Roundabout and over the bridge. At 9:15 around 20 Metropolitan Police began engaging with the marchers and issued a Section 7 order from the Public Order Act 2023. At 9:29 arrests began. All supporters taking action today are expected to be arrested. On Monday over 100 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested for marching down Whitehall from Trafalgar square. It was incorrectly reported on social media that Just Stop Oil supporters had targeted the cenotaph, It was later confirmed by the Met that it was in fact the police that had moved Just Stop Oil supporters towards the cenotaph after they had arrested them. [2] Sixteen people were held to appear in court from police custody and were seen at Stratford, Westminster and Bromley Magistrates Courts on Tuesday. Five people remain in police custody, they have been held for over 45 hours.They are expected to appear in court this morning. One of those on the road this morning, Geraldine Swift, 57, an NHS consultant psychiatrist, said: “I am a passionate and persistent moderate who believes in the rule of law, but this cannot be an absolute – we can all think of bad laws in the past, and bad decisions made by governments.” “We are in a climate and health emergency now: this is what the science tells us, the United Nations and my college, the Royal College of Psychiatrists.” “Rishi Sunak, please STOP all new exploitation of fossil fuels. People of Britain, please join me in this demand for our planet, our health and our children.” “I believe that the level of risk and urgency justifies my breaking the law and I am willing to be arrested for my beliefs, having never been in trouble with the police before.” Also marching today is Mike Exley, 66, a builder from Stroud. He said: “As a father of 2 grown up girls and having 2 grown up step-children, I feel extremely worried about their future lives. This government’s willingness to ignore climate scientists & to continue to issue licences for the extraction of gas, oil & coal, only shows their callous disregard for my children’s survival.” “The thought that our beautiful home, now quickly being depleted of wildlife, might soon edge towards an unstoppable climate catastrophe, just fills me with sadness & rage. Me marching today will be seen as a criminal act by this government, but these politicians, who’s short term greed & disregard for my children’s life, are the true criminals.” This morning’s march comes as there are still thousands of homes and businesses without water in Surrey after Storm Ciarán left a treatment facility damaged. Record sea temperatures are driving an increase in extreme weather events and supercharging storm systems. [3] We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas. From 20th November, Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join us every day at midday in Trafalgar Square to march in London until the government comes to its senses and ends new oil and gas.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/08/just-stop-oil-supporters-arrested-for-marching-as-police-continue-to-facilitate-the-criminal-acts-of-government/",3
"105","Supporting Just Stop Oil – By Jonathon Porritt",2023-11-07,"“Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels is moral and economic madness.” -Antonio Guterres, August 2023 Just Stop Oil’s slow marching campaign recommenced on Sunday 29th October. I shall be supporting them financially, and have agreed to speak out on their behalf, and to advocate for their campaign objectives. Just Stop Oil’s uncompromising position is wholly justified – morally and politically. Its central objective is crystal clear – and not even particularly radical: “that the UK Government makes a statement that it will immediately halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK.” As well as the Green Party, it’s a position supported by the Labour Party and the Lib Dems. It is a position supported by an extraordinary diversity of people and organisations – from the Pope to the International Energy Agency, from the UK’s Committee on Climate Change to Greta Thunberg and UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, as well as the vast majority of climate scientists. Unfortunately, the current UK Government has chosen to ignore all that, and has simultaneously trashed the UK’s reputation as a leader (relatively speaking) on climate change by doubling down on new oil, gas and coal investments. Rishi Sunak recently took great pleasure in rolling back critical elements in the Government’s own Net Zero Plan. The contempt both for science and the interests of young people today literally beggars belief. Whatever tomorrow’s climate historians come to conclude about 2023, it will certainly be judged as the most disturbing year to date as regards the frequency and intensity of “extreme anomalies”, with countless records broken, “unprecedented regime shifts”, and certain tipping points (particularly the loss of sea ice in Antarctica and huge increases in ocean surface temperatures) looming ever larger. This is not the place to itemise all those different tipping points – other than to comment on the change of tone in the language used by scientists as they try to convey just how close to the edge we now are. “Disbelief”, “downright terror”, “consternation”, “near panic”, “gut churning fear”, “deep, deep sadness” – all these were in the mix. Zeke Hausfather recently described the extreme anomaly of ocean surface temperatures as “gobsmackingly bananas”. That’s what the science tells us today. And you might think, after a decade of ever-worsening climate impacts, that we would have at least started to get a grip on changing course. Sadly not. Emissions of greenhouse gases increased in 2022, and there’s little sign that they will start going down in 2023. The International Energy Agency has reported that the demand for oil hit a record 103 million barrels a day in June. It’s almost certain that 2023 will be declared as the warmest year ever. In a way that still astonishes me, on an almost daily basis, all this would appear to be having a net zero impact on today’s political leaders. Indeed, Sunak’s Government has chosen to go to war with today’s climate campaigners, aggressively asserting its right to “squeeze every last drop of oil out of the North Sea”, and continues to “go slow” as regards investing in all those critical technologies on which a future decarbonised economy depends – despite endless petitioning from the business community for the Government to get its act together. Ministers lie through their teeth on an almost daily basis, bolstered by the UK’s predominantly right-wing media and, sadly, by the craven cowardice of the BBC in not taking them on. On September 20th, the Prime Minister doubled down on his own particular brand of “green scepticism” by announcing a suite of decisions to roll back on the Government’s Net Zero agenda, all notionally in the interest of “hard-working families” struggling with the cost-of- living crisis – for which, ironically, his own Government is largely responsible. With a degree of calculating cruelty, these decisions included an indefinite delay to measures (first introduced by David Cameron 12 years ago!) mandating landlords to improve energy efficiency for all rented properties by 2025. I describe this as “cruel” simply because 25% of private renters already live in fuel poverty, and many already pay far more for their gas and electricity than homeowners. And can do nothing about it themselves. At the same time, the UK Government has done more than any other in the Western world to put an end to direct-action campaigning by organisations such as Just Stop Oil, XR and Greenpeace. The 2022 Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act gave the police incredibly vague powers to crack down on any protest on the suspicion that it might be disruptive. The 2023 Public Order Act created a new offence of “intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance”, setting stiff penalties for campaigners chaining themselves to anything, supergluing themselves to roads, or “interfering with key national infrastructure”. Subsequent amendments to the 1986 Public Order Act (ruthlessly rammed through Parliament) gave the police even more powers to impose conditions on any planned protests which they believe “may cause more than minor disruption” (no longer even “serious disruption”). In effect, the UK has been turned into a police state right in front of our noses. To add insult to industry, defendants on trial can be deprived of the right to explain themselves to a jury in court. Trudi Warner faces a possible jail sentence for her protest outside the Inner London Crown Court reminding jurors of their “absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience”. Against that backdrop, it would be surprising if the oil and gas sector did anything other than prioritise the short-term interest of their shareholders over the long-term future of life on Earth. From 2015 (the date of the Paris agreement) to 2022, oil and gas companies invested an astonishing $4.8 trillion in different kinds of energy – a mere $100 billion of which was in low-carbon technologies. This year’s Oil and Gas Benchmark Report (published annually by the World Benchmarking Alliance and the Climate Disclosure Project (CDP)) concluded that the sector had made next to zero progress in moving towards the Paris goals of 2015. Worse yet, many of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies (benefiting from record profits on account of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) are even now intensifying their search for new oil and gas reserves, confident in their estimates that today’s politicians will do nothing to prevent them from “drilling deep” for as long as they can get away with it. The Executives and Board Directors of these companies are all out-and-out climate criminals. We have to hope that one day they will be tried and dealt with as harshly possible for their criminality, immorality and personal venality. But such corporate criminality only thrives because governments condone it – indeed, enthusiastically promote it. According to the International Monetary Fund: “globally, fossil fuel subsidies were $5.9 trillion (or 6.8% of GDP) in 2020, and are expected to increase to 7.4% of GDP in 2025”. That’s roughly £10 million every minute of every day. According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, subsidies paid out by G20 governments reached a record £1.1 trillion in 2022. Most of that huge sum represents the fact that fossil fuel companies are not paying for the massive damage they’re doing to the environment, to the climate, and to people’s health through chronic air pollution. The rest is reflected in governments subsidising the price of oil, gas and coal for consumers, and in direct subsidies to the fossil fuel companies themselves. A 2022 report from the B Team and Business for Nature (“Financing our Survival”) assessed those direct subsidies to fossil fuel companies at $640 billion a year. Unfortunately, the Labour Party offers Just Stop Oil campaigners limited hope of being much of an improvement when it comes to phasing out fossil fuels as fast as possible. Indeed, its position is deeply compromised: if/when it’s in power, it will not issue any new licences, but nor will it cancel licences that have already been granted by this Conservative Government. That is gesture politics at its worst: with 100 new North Sea licences already confirmed by Rishi Sunak, and a licence for the massive Rosebank field, there’s literally not one drop more to be squeezed out of the North Sea anyway. World-weary climate campaigners may see all this as yet more chronic failures on the part of our increasingly dysfunctional political system. But try seeing all this through the eyes of young people today: • You’ve followed the science – and see no reason not to believe what the vast majority of scientists are saying about the Climate Emergency. You’ve listened to the warnings of those you trust, from Greta Thunberg to Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the UN. • You’ve worked out what your generation’s future looks like, impacted more and more dramatically by climate disasters through to 2050 and beyond. The actions of Big Oil systematically kill off whatever hope you might have of a better world – and the part that you might play in it. • In the face of all that, you’ve decided the Government’s response is not just hopelessly inadequate, but totally immoral, dishonest and callous. • So you’ve decided you don’t want to be a ‘bystander’ by accepting as ‘normal’ the kind of suicidal disconnect from the science that has been going on for decades. You’ve decided that you want to take action, even if that means you’re putting your own personal liberty on the line, risking increasingly severe sanctions at the hands of an increasingly authoritarian Government. How much cognitive dissonance is it reasonable to expect young people to live with? It’s pretty horrendous coping with all this at the age of 73, but it’s all but impossible for me to imagine how I would be dealing with it, psychologically, if I was still looking ahead to a long life ahead of me. I don’t think there’s any doubt that I would be joining with colleagues, of my own age, to take direct action – for many reasons, but primarily to keep despair at bay through taking that action. This is so shameful. It’s on my generation’s watch that this “theft of young people’s future” has happened. Where once we had some (albeit limited) claim to leadership in addressing the Climate Emergency, the UK is now numbered in the worst category of recidivist fossil fuel addicts, incapable of recognising that it’s simply not possible to keep a foot in both camps: you either “get clean”, free of fossil fuels, or wilfully double down on the collective suicide pact to which so many politicians are still signatories. I’m pretty sure most reasonable people today would go along with this kind of analysis – albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm. But that’s where the debate about tactics kicks in. Just Stop Oil initially focused its actions on oil and gas installations, but this got harder and harder as the injunctions multiplied and the full force of the law became more and more draconian. As well as which, its current tactics (including both high profile protests at sporting events and art galleries, as well as its slow marches) have certainly succeeded in getting far more media attention. The basic idea is to oblige people “to pick a side”, deliberately making it harder and harder for them to “stay neutral”. I’m so with them on this: neutrality today amounts either to wilful complicity or intellectual laziness. If nothing else, Just Stop Oil makes us confront our failures, our own potential complacency or indifference. It denies us the consolation of taking refuge in our perceived helplessness. Just Stop Oil urges us not to worry about courting unpopularity (as campaigner Louise Harris put it: “you might hate me for doing this, and you’re entitled to hate me”), but to dig down into our own conscience to examine the deeper moral issues entailed in today’s continuing ecocidal economy. Having said that, I do find myself asking if it really makes sense to continue with tactics which almost certainly alienate more people than they win over, handing our right-wing media limitless opportunities to attack not just the tactics of Just Stop Oil but the cause itself? I’d love them to focus more on the oil and gas companies themselves, their investors and insurers (who I believe to be as criminal as the companies themselves), their suppliers, professional advisers and so on or all those who still take their money as sponsors. But I know just how hard this has now become under today’s oppressive legal sanctions. In all honesty, I have no idea if Just Stop Oil will be able to carry on campaigning in the way it does today. It could just turn out to be another “massively disruptive flash in the pan”. That would be sad – but not game-changing. There will always be another way of giving voice to the kind of crystal-clear logic that informs Just Stop Oil’s work, another way of converting that logic into courageous deeds. The cause of intergenerational justice is going to become more and more important as the disregard for the lives of young people today, and for all future generations, becomes ever more immoral. And this, I believe, will become the single most important test of my own generation. So that’s how I see my role now – providing intergenerational support to young people in whatever way might be genuinely useful – although I have no idea at the moment what that might look like in practice over the next few months.

"106","Maternal love in action! 25 mothers arrested for demanding a better future for the world’s children",2023-11-06,"This afternoon, a group of mothers and grandmothers were arrested while slow-marching in London in support of Just Stop Oil’s demand for the government to end new oil and gas. [1] At 1:38pm, 33 Just Stop Oil supporting mothers and grandmothers began marching down Whitehall from Trafalgar Square. Metropolitan Police arrived at around 1:41 pm and kettled the group of mothers. By 2:10, around 40 officers had arrested 25 mothers, including a grandmother aged 79 and even a great grandmother. They were detained for allegedly breaching Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023. Since Just Stop Oil’s most recent campaign began a week ago, police have refused to respect our supporters’ rights to protest and have opted for immediately arresting slow marchers, but this group of mothers refused to be intimidated. The mothers say that they refuse to stand by while government policies continue to support the fossil fuel industry, leading to global suffering on an unprecedented scale. The marching mums carried placards explaining why they felt compelled to resist: for their children, for all the world’s children and future generations. Gill Tavner, a mother of two daughters, aged 19 and 21, from Stroud said: “We’re marching here to oppose corporate greed with maternal love. For years we’ve watched in mounting disbelief as global leaders have failed to take the necessary action to reduce the burning of fossil fuels. This government is travelling in completely the wrong direction. “It’s crazy that in asking for a liveable world for our children we are vilified and criminalised. My heart aches when I think about the difficulties ahead for my girls, and even more so for less privileged children in the world. If we could rely on responsible leadership, this action would not be necessary, but politics is broken and so I’m compelled to take action. It’s the most important thing I can do as a mother.” Angela Holland, 79, a mother of three and grandmother of five, from Bristol said: “I’m inspired to march and risk arrest by my grandson and whole family. Their determination has pushed me to read the research on climate breakdown, to understand the urgency for action and to try and adjust my lifestyle accordingly. As George Monbiot says, survival requires disobedience!” Her daughter, Sophie Holland aged 52, a speech therapist and also a mother of three, said: “I’m here because where else would I be? The world is disappearing before our eyes – flooded, burnt, species after species vanishing. Scientists are telling us, loud and clear, this is our last chance. The UN secretary general, the International Energy Agency, Sir David Attenborough, Chris Packham are all saying we are facing catastrophe if we continue to burn fossil fuels. Why isn’t everyone who has children, or knows children, or sees pictures of already displaced and starving children; on the streets, demanding change from our self-serving, criminal government?” This morning, two of the mums were on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. They are now on their way to police cells. They explained to presenter Emma Barnett, herself a new mother, why they would be stepping into action two hours later, knowing that they would be facing their first ever arrests and the newly-increased likelihood of severe penalties. “Our fear of what might happen to us today pales into insignificance compared with our fear about the future unless humanity changes course immediately,’“they said. A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “We will not be intimidated by our criminal government. Not content with maxing out our oil and gas reserves they are complicit in the greatest crime in human history. New oil and gas will result in unimaginable suffering and destroy the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. No one has ever voted for this, there has never been a democratic mandate to destroy the habitable world.” “Just Stop Oil supporters are deeply committed to stopping all new oil and gas. If our government refuses to do what is right to protect humanity, then people will step up to do what needs to be done.” “The painful truth right now is that our politicians and corporations have no intention of acting in accordance with the fundamental interests of either our young people or the country as a whole. Whether those in charge realise that they are committing the crime of genocide, is not the question. For this is how it will be seen by the next generation and all future generations. Our friends in police custody and languishing in prison understand this very well as do we.” New oil and gas will push the world past irreversible tipping points, destroy our ability to grow food and result in the collapse of organised civil society. Everything we know and love is threatened. To allow any new oil and gas, in full knowledge of these consequences, isn’t just a crime against humanity. It is the greatest crime in human history. [2][3][4][5] We will not let this stand. We refuse to die quietly. Civil resistance is no longer an option, it is a necessity. This month, hundreds of ordinary people are marching with Just Stop Oil in London, and we will not stop until we win. From November 20th, we invite everyone to join us as we meet everyday at midday in Trafalgar Square before marching through the streets of London.

"107","Over 100 Just Stop Oil supporters shut down Whitehall",2023-11-06,"Just Stop Oil supporters have continued their campaign of peacefully marching in the streets of London, to the point of arrest. They are demanding the government immediately halt all new oil, gas, and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 11:33am this morning, 130 Just Stop Oil supporters from the North and South West of England began marching down Whitehall from Trafalgar Square. A small number of Metropolitan Police arrived at 11:37am. At 11:52 am they began arresting Just Stop Oil supporters for allegedly breaching Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, but they were unable to bring the march to a halt at this stage, and the supporters made their way to Parliament. By 12:02 there were more than 100 police on the scene. By 12:13 all Just Stop Oil Supporters were arrested, with most peaceully refusing to comply with the police. Events are still unfolding. Today marked the start of a second week of slow marching. According to the Metropolitan Police, a total of 111 people were arrested last week, with 54 being people charged, 4 put on tag, and 3 held on remand in Wandsworth, Thameside and Bronzefield prisons. Last week, police officers arrested Just Stop Oil supporters for simply handing out leaflets on the pavement, causing one man to suffer a fit after being violently restrained. [2] Earlier this morning, two Just Stop Oil supporters took action at The National Gallery in Central London where they smashed the glass protecting The Rokeby Venus, a painting by Diego Velázquez that was famously slashed seven times by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. One of those taking action today was Laura Fretwell, a 23 year old retail worker from Ilkeston. She said: “I’m taking action with Just Stop Oil because if we don’t end new oil and gas, everything we know and love will be destroyed because of the greed of a select few. The government needs to take drastic action now to prevent climate chaos. Their refusal to do so condemns us all.” “I will march, facing the threat of violence and arrest, because our children deserve better than to be living on a dying planet. We owe it to them to create a better world, as our elders have done for us.” Also marching today is Justin Jago, 53, a registered blind guide dog user from Bristol, who said: “I am marching in response to government plans to issue over 100 new oil and gas licences.  I am angry that this government has failed to address the catastrophe that is killing people around the world and threatens the future of humanity without immediate action. Soaring temperatures and adverse weather conditions are causing forest fires and flooding, killing countless people and causing mass displacement of families. “Historically civil disobedience has been the catalyst for positive change when governments have failed us, and I can’t ignore the facts. We owe it to children and young people facing a frightening future to act.” We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas. From 20th November, Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join us everday at midday in Trafalgar Square to march in London until the government comes to its senses and ends new oil and gas.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/06/over-100-just-stop-oil-supporters-shut-down-whitehall/",3
"108","“Women didn’t get the vote by voting; it’s time for deeds not words”- Just Stop Oil supporters smash suffragette painting",2023-11-06,"Two young Just Stop Oil supporters have smashed the glass cover of a painting once famously slashed by a suffragette. They are demanding the government immediately halt all new oil and gas projects in the UK. At around 10:45 am Hanan, 22, and Harrison, 20, used safety hammers to smash the glass covering the Rokeby Venus. They then addressed the gallery by saying: “Women did not get the vote by voting; it is time for deeds not words. It is time to Just Stop Oil.” They added: “Politics is failing us. It failed women in 1914 and it is failing us now. New oil and gas will kill millions. If we love art, if we love life, if we love our families we must Just Stop Oil.” The Rokeby Venus was famously slashed in the National Gallery by the suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, causing particular damage to the area between the figure’s shoulders, however, all were successfully repaired. Richardson’s action was in resistance to the UK government’s imprisonment of Emmeline Pankhurst at the time. She explained her actions after the incident- “I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.” A Just Stop Oil spokesperson commented: “Emmeline Pankhurst once said: ‘The argument of the broken window pane is the most valuable argument in modern politics’. Disappointingly little has changed since 1914. From governments destroying the most beautiful character in history, to governments destroying our home, our families and our institutions in order to enrich criminal oil barons and corporations. The only thing that has ever stood in their way is ordinary people, taking to the streets to demand change. We invite everyone to join us.” One of those taking action today, Hanan Ameur, 22 a student from London, said: “Over 100 years ago, the suffragette Mary Richardson attacked the Rokeby venus portrait for the unjust imprisonment of Emmeline Pankhurst. Today I have used similar methods in the fight for climate justice.” “As a kid I saw myself growing up to be an astronaut or a singer. I saw a future, however ridiculous it was. Now, those day-dreams have ended. The future we are heading for doesn’t allow space for them anymore.” “It’s always been down to ordinary people to tell their governments when they’ve crossed a line. Civil resistance worked for the suffragettes and it will work for us.” Also taking action today is Harrison Donnelly, 20, a student from Nottingham. He said: “Emmeline Pankhurst said: you have to make more noise than anybody else, you have to make yourself more obtrusive than anybody else, you have to fill all the papers more than anybody else.” “The suffragettes are proof these methods work to achieve social change. That is why we have taken this action today. New oil will destroy everything we love. I do not want to be here, but I cannot continue to see this government fail all of us.” On Friday three people were imprisoned for 28 days, without trial, for marching slowly in the road. Many others have been bailed out of London and have been put under house arrest on ankle tag. Today, many more will march to the point of arrest and potential imprisonment. We are not prepared to watch silently while this government, bought by the criminals in the oil industry, are planning for millions to die, whilst the judiciary imprisons those that stand against this injustice. We will march in ever greater numbers and we will keep marching until this government stops all new oil and gas projects in the UK. We are inviting everyone to join Just Stop Oil slow marching on the streets of London. Meet 12pm Trafalgar Square every day from November 20th.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/06/women-didnt-get-the-vote-by-voting-its-time-for-deeds-not-words-just-stop-oil-supporters-smash-suffragette-painting/",3

[2] On Thursday, three Just Stop Oil supporters were remanded to prison for a month for taking part in a 10 minute march on Wednesday. At Westminster Magistrates court Sam Griffiths, 48, a father and designer from Walthamstow and Chrissy Kelly, 65, a retired social care worker were ordered to be detained until 30th November. At Bromley Magistrates Court, Merle Gering was also remanded until 30 November. A further 11 supporters were bailed from court on Thursday, of whom 4 were required to wear a GPS tag. [3] Three Just Stop Oil supporters have been held in police custody since Wednesday and were seen at Stratford Magistrates today where they were released on bail. One of those taking action this afternoon was Alistair Glasse, 63, an Astronomer and Instrument scientist from West Linton. Alistair has worked as project scientist at the UK Infrared Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and as a research assistant in the Infrared Space Observatory team at European Space Agency (ESA)/ European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in the Netherlands. He said: “After spending over 20 years helping to build the James Webb Space Telescope, I have seen scientific consensus repeatedly ignored, lied about and even ridiculed by popular media and government. This is now my only way to respond and protest their murderous criminality in allowing more hydrocarbon extraction. I implore every sane and thoughtful person to join us in this struggle for humanity’s future.” Also marching today is Anne Taylor, 74, a former teacher from Leicester. She said: “I am doing this for my grandchildren. They deserve a future, but this government is systematically destroying everything by licensing more oil fields. People are dying right now, 61,000 people died across Europe due to the extreme heat last year alone. Tens of thousands of Libyans washed out to sea. 7 have died in our own country in this last week due to extreme weather.” “I cannot just sit back and allow this to happen. I will do all that I can to ensure the safety of my family and everyone else’s. The government is committing genocide. I will not sit by and allow this to happen. So I am taking action with Just Stop Oil and you should too.” We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas. From 20th November, Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join us at midday in Trafalgar Square to march in London until the government comes to its senses and ends new oil and gas.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/11/03/defiant-just-stop-oil-supporters-risk-prison-to-cause-rush-hour-disruption/",3
"110","Court round-up, Friday Nov 3rd",2023-11-03,"So what’s happening in the courts? The wheels of justice grind on relentlessly as hired thugs in big oil suits pursue those pesky Supporters of Life on Earth through the courts. Justice is blind to the unfolding disaster being planned by politicians and executives. Magistrates The endless roll call of magistrates cases has continued over the last two weeks, with several cases of those involved in Civil Resistance in court charged with Wilful Obstruction of the Highway or Breach of Section 12 of the Public Order Act. Wednesday 1st November saw the case against four Just Stop Oil and Animal Rising supporters dismissed due to insufficient evidence, while on November 2nd Epson Judge Goldberry Magistrates court rescheduled the Wimbledon Glitterati 3’s trial to February 2024 as the prosecution had behaved shoddily by failing to serve defendants with required evidence. Westminster magistrates courts saw scenes of chaos unfolding on Tuesday 31st Oct, as those slow marching with Just Stop Oil who had refused to give their names were brought before court. Multiple Anonymous’ proving difficult for the courts to keep track of. Those who had been held on remand continue to be seen throughout the week. That the courts are now a site of civil resistance is becoming ever more clear. On Thursday in defiance of the Judge asking Sam Griffiths if he would slow march again if released on bail – Sam refused to answer. As a result he is now being held for a month on remand. Later on Thursday he was joined by two others, Chrissy Kelly and Merle Gering. Jailed for walking down a road. Crown Court At the High Courts the previous fortnight has been busy – 27th October at Lewes Crown Court those charged with Criminal Damage for the Cobham Service Station petrol pump actions were sentenced. The six people present should have been there with Xavier who died this year in February, he was sorely missed today as Louis McKechnie told the court. The six in court received suspended sentences and community service, they were also ordered to pay £526 in costs. Over at the Royal Courts of Justice the first group of Just Stop Oil supporters charged with breaking the National Highways M25 Injunction for climbing or attempting to climb onto the motorway gantries were summoned to Court. The case started on Monday 23rd October, with sentencing delivered on Monday 30th October. The two who admitted knowledge of the injunction were given suspended sentences, the 10 who proved they had no knowledge received no sanction. There was a lot of court faff, sorry legal discussion during the trial, with the Judge coming to the decision that lack of knowledge (of the injunction) is not a defence but can be used to mitigate sentence  – the injunction that had been obtained the day before at a secret ‘Microsoft teams’ meeting, and then sent out to a few random email addresses with JustStopOil in them. Costs have yet to be decided, they are different to a sentence. This is the “winning” side trying to claim back the money they spent on DLA Piper, over priced lawyers for the injunction. The 12 Just Stop Oil supporters were represented by a barrister, supported by a solicitor. NHL had more lawyers than you could shake a stick at. Of course they did. All in all another week in which the Judiciary continues to protect those planning to kill us, while pursuing and prosecuting those seeking to defend themselves. Extinction Rebellion cases are also trundling through the High Court. The glorious XR Fire Truck verdict was allowed to be made public – a resounding Not Guilty for all involved. Dr Gail Bradbrook’s trial concluded this week with a guilty verdict for criminal damage, sentencing to follow. A four year marathon, which saw the first trial jury dismissed, Gail threatened with contempt of court and no defence or reference to motivation allowed. Silenced in Court. In stark contrast the nine women who smashed HSBC’s windows, whose trial started this week have been allowed the defences of ‘necessity’, ‘belief in consent’ and ‘protection of property’, well allowed until they have given their evidence at which point the Judge can rule that they have no defence. I know it doesn’t make sense. The climate Scientist Wolfgang Knorr has written this piece on what is happening in our courts – its worth a read. You both have and don’t have a legal defence. You have to swear to tell the whole truth, and yet are not allowed to tell the truth. The Jury has legal rights but you can be in contempt of court if you tell them of their rights. You must come to court but you may not defend yourself. More to come…… Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"111","” Prosecute the real climate criminals” : Three Just Stop Oil supporters remanded to prison for slow marching",2023-11-02,"This morning, at Westminster Magistrates Court,  a Just Stop Oil supporter was remanded to prison after slow marching in London, marking the first time that a basic act of protest has become imprisonable. Sam Griffiths, 48, a father and designer from Walthamstow, appeared before Judge Goldspring and was remanded to prison for a minimum of 28 days for marching on the streets of London to demand an end to new oil and gas. [1]A further 8 slow marchers appeared at Westminster Magistrates courts this afternoon before the same Judge; one, Chrissy Kelly, 65, a retired social care worker from Muswell Hill, was remanded until 30 November, while the remaining 7 were bailed from court. Five Just Stop Oil supporters appeared at Bromley magistrates court today, where Merle Gering was remanded until 30 November, and a further four supporters were released on GPS tag. The Metropolitan Police reported that 23 people were charged as a result of Wednesday’s slow march. Of these 14 appeared in court Thursday (where 3 were remanded and 11 were bailed from court).  A further 3 Just Stop Oil supporters have been held in police custody since Wednesday and are expected to be presented in magistrates court Friday. [2] Both Sam and Chrissy were charged with a Public Order Act 2023 Section 7 offence relating to interfering with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure (roads). They both self represented in court and were each offered a choice of having their cases heard at a Magistrates or a Crown Court.  The magistrate said that as section 7 was a new offence there was no precedent for charging but the maximum sentence for a guilty verdict in a magistrates court was 6 months, against 12 months at Crown Court. Sam said, “if I am going to be facing a custodial sentence then I want to be tried by a jury of my peers.” The Crown Prosecution Service then argued for Sam to be remanded on the grounds that he has one conviction already, and has a charge to appear at Westminster Magistrates for Wilful Obstruction of the Highway. Sam responded  “the real criminals should be investigated.” Sam refused to answer the question of whether he would continue to slow march. Later he argued that walking on the road was exercising his right to protest and that it was proportionate. The Judge said he has nothing against protest but that if it breaks the law then that’s a problem. He had reached a decision that if Sam was to be released he would reoffend. Sam was remanded to prison for 28 days after which time he will be brought before another judge. The remand will expire on May 2nd (unless extended). Towards the end of the hearing Sam removed a jumper to reveal a t-shirt which said “Prosecute the real climate criminals“. As he left, he waved to the people in the gallery. Speaking before slow marching this week, Sam Griffiths said: “The thing that keeps me up at night is food supply. Ours is fragile and there are so many pressures on it. When it goes wrong we’ll lose the rule of law and people will starve. My boy will starve. He’s 13 now,  and it breaks my heart to think about the world he will see. So I want to do everything in my power to fight for him and his future. And have done ever since I first truly, properly, emotionally connected with what’s happening – when we hit 40°C in London for the first time and we saw things starting to burn. “ Chrissie Kelly said: “ I will never stop fighting for my children’s futures. I can only listen to my own conscience and act for all life on earth. The only option now is ongoing nonviolent civil resistance. I won’t stand by and see our only home destroyed.” A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “More and more ordinary people understand what those involved in our judicial system do not and that is that no-one is safe from the consequences of runaway global heating. You might feel immune from extreme heat waves and mass crop failure, but in the end we will all see our children starve and have to face riots and war. “Why, then, is the legal system aiding and abetting our criminal government in persecuting ordinary people trying to protect humanity when we should all be working together to deal with the impacts of climate breakdown and societal collapse?” Our leaders cannot continue to ignore and exacerbate this crisis by encouraging new oil and gas, while floods and fires consume everything we hold dear. In November, we are calling for daily marches in London until the government comes to its senses and stops new oil and gas. Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join us in civil resistance.

"112","Just Stop Oil supporters refusing to cooperate as 40 arrested",2023-11-01,"Just Stop Oil supporters are continuing to march in London today to the point of arrest. They are demanding the government immediately halt all new oil, gas, and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 9am this morning around 45 Just Stop Oil supporters from the Midlands and East of England began marching on Cromwell Road in West London. After approximately 10 minutes, Metropolitan Police officers arrived on the scene and called for backup, demanding that protestors leave the road. Within the next 22 minutes, approximately 40 of the marchers were arrested under Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023. On Monday, 62 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested, with arrests starting after 10 minutes of marching around Parliament Square. Most refused to cooperate with the police, by ‘going floppy’ on arrest and several refused to give their names to the police, forcing police to hold them in custody overnight and present them at a magistrates court. 31 people have now been charged, 14 have been remanded into custody, while a further 17 have been bailed to court. One of those taking action this morning, Rachel White 53, a mental health worker from Rochford said: “I have tried standing as a candidate for the Green Party, I have tried signing petitions, writing to MP’s, attending COP 26, but nothing’s changed. In fact it’s gotten worse, and so I can no longer be a bystander. I want my granddaughter and grandson to know I tried to do something. I want them to know their grandmother was not complicit with the crimes of this government.” “MPs are well informed and they know that the scale of suffering that has begun is an unprecedented crime against humanity, and that the suffering will only worsen if we do not stop oil & gas emissions, yet they’ve just green-lit Rosebank, which will emit more carbon into the atmosphere than 28 whole countries.” Also marching today is Rebecca Narracott, 46, a teacher from Norwich, who said: “I have three brilliant teenagers who I want to see grow and thrive in a healthy and safe world, but on our current trajectory, this will not be their reality. I am taking action this week because I am privileged enough to be able to, therefore it is my moral obligation to at least try.” “I am speaking out against our morally bankrupt and broken system of politics and governance; people have power and we must use our voices and bodies to say ‘not in our name.’ It’s time to take to the streets, join us on a slow-march, sign up at juststopoil.org.” This morning’s marches come ahead of the UK touchdown of Storm Ciarán later today. Storm Ciarán is being called a “bomb cyclone” and is predicted to be the strongest storm Britain has experienced since records began 200 years ago. The UK is forecast to experience winds touching 100mph, causing widespread disruption and threat to life. Ciaran’s impending arrival has prompted the Environment Agency to issue over 70 flood warnings. Ciaran’s arrival, hot on the heels of Storms Babet and Agnes, underscores the escalating pattern of extreme weather events associated with global heating. Record sea surface temperatures are driving the rapid intensification of the storm which is expected to bring record rainfall, high winds and a high storm surge across the south coast of UK and Northern France. [2][3][4] The march this morning was joined by a person, not pictured, who marched peacefully alongside with a banner that promoted her website. We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us.

"113","No prison for M25 Injunction breakers",2023-10-30,"Today 12 Just Stop Oil supporters were sentenced for contempt of court for breaking an M25 injunction at the Royal Courts of Justice at the end of a 5 day civil hearing. Theresa Norton and Mair Bain received suspended sentences as they admitted prior knowledge of the National Highways Injunction, the other ten were found not to have prior knowledge and received no penalty [1]. They are the first group of 44 people who have been summoned to the High Court accused of breaking a National Highways injunction when they climbed or attempted to climb gantries over the M25 in November 2022. [2][3] Much of the court time had been spent in legal argument centring around two points. Judge Soole ruled that the defendants had to: first, prove they did not know about the injunction and second, prove this to a civil standard, that is on the balance of probabilities not beyond reasonable doubt. Sentencing the 12, Judge Soole said:“While each had [their] own circumstances, there were commonalities. In each case they acted on their conscience, for reasons related to climate change and the mitigation of fossil fuels… their conscientious motivations are relevant. They are law abiding citizens apart from protest activities. In each case, she or he accepts that in a democratic society it is the duty of persons to break the law in line with their beliefs.” Paul Bell, said:“I’m a 23 year old climate scientist, listening to arguments on whether or not a made up, paid for law gets to take away my freedom for peaceful climate protest after people have died in Scotland’s record flooding. The system is broken, we need to pick a side, come and join hundreds of people slow marching every day from today”. Thersea Norton said:“The system is rigged, it was no surprise to be found guilty, it is designed to be that way. More than ever we need to unite in civil resistance against a government intent on making genocidal decisions like issuing 100 new oil and gas licences” A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said:“To claim, as Justice Soole did, that he is not going to determine ‘issues concerning climate change’, that he has been asked to decide only ‘whether people had knowingly breached an injunction’ shows us how the establishment operates and protects those who are committing climate genocide. ‘I’m only following orders’ – well heads up, its genocide and that doesn’t wash, we all have a responsibility to make it stop. Today no one was imprisoned or fined, but the fact that 12 people have spent over a week in court, facing the loss of their the freedom for disobeying a ‘private law’ and now face criminal charges for the same action demonstrates our courts are not protecting the ordinary people of this country, but defending those making profit by killing people” We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas.

"114","65 Just Stop Oil supporters arrested in Parliament Square after 10 minutes of marching",2023-10-30,"Just Stop Oil supporters are marching in London today to demand the government immediately halt all new oil, gas, and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 10am this morning 65 Just Stop Oil supporters from the Midlands and East of England began marching around Parliament Square. At 10:10am, a number of Metropolitan Police arrived and began pushing the Just Stop Oil supporters back and forming a chain across the road in an unsuccessful attempt to stop them from marching. Unlike previous Just Stop Oil slow marches which were policed using Section 12 orders, they issued a Section 7 order which criminalises members of the public based on alleged interference with ‘the use or operation of key national infrastructure’. [2] Immediately the police began making arrests, arresting 65 people by 10:37. Officers dragged peaceful Just Stop Oil supporters across the pavement, kneeling and sitting on them to detain them. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Just Stop Oil supporters are willing to slow march to the point of arrest today, and every day until the police take action to prosecute the real criminals – the people who are facilitating new oil and gas when they know that to do so will kill hundreds of millions of people. “Just in the last week, seven people have died in the UK as a result of extreme weather and scientists are telling us it will only get worse. Neither major political party is serving the interests of the country- they are serving the mass murderers profiting while the world burns. There is no real opposition. “In times of crisis, it is down to ordinary people to take a stand against the rich and powerful by disrupting business-as-usual. We know it works. A mass road blocking campaign has just forced the Dutch government to halt oil and gas subsidies. That’s why people are coming together from all over the UK to march day after day in London from today. Its People vs Oil! Sign up at JustStopOil.org” Since 2021 when the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) declared that there could be no new oil, gas or coal if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating, it has been clear that new oil and gas licensing will kill hundreds of millions of people. [3] This morning Just Stop Oil published a list of five high-profile individuals with specific responsibility for encouraging new oil and gas. The list uses evidence gathered by the World Environmental Crimes Unit and suggests that these individuals know all about the crisis to which they are contributing – but have carried on creating the conditions for mass killings regardless. Under Article 30 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, this means that the five men on our list could be guilty of the crime of genocide by oblique intent.  [4][5] Just Stop Oil wrote to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley on 26th October 2023 to demand that he open an investigation into the politicians and executives responsible for these crimes.[6] One of those taking action this morning, Dr Ian Chapman, 52, a GP from Bury St Edmunds said: “20 or 30 years from now, I won’t look back and regret having taken direct action, but I will regret it if I don’t. I expect to get arrested today, whilst the people in the building I’m marching past are making decisions that will kill millions. I will get off the road when the police take action against the real criminals.” “We’re running out of time, and we all need to do what we can, right now. I don’t see how you can say you care about future generations, or your nieces and nephews or your grandchildren – I don’t see how you can say you love your children – if you do nothing to stop the destruction of the world they are going to grow up in.” Also marching today is Imogen May, 24, a food producer from Halesworth. She said: “I’m marching with Just Stop Oil because I have a six month old nephew, and I am so scared to think what his world will look like in five or ten years’ time. I’d love to live a normal life, without worrying about climate collapse. I know that to have a chance at having a normal life later, we have to take action now.” “We’re simply demanding that the UK government does what its own advisors are asking it to do; the same thing as the United Nations, the Climate Change Committee and the Independent Panel on Climate Change. We must halt all new licences for fossil fuel production in the UK.” We are not prepared to watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas.

"115","Six Just Stop Oil supporters who smashed petrol pumps at Cobham services receive suspended sentences",2023-10-27,"Six Just Stop Oil supporters who were found guilty of criminal damage for smashing petrol pumps at Cobham services on the M25 last year, received suspended sentences at Lewes Crown Court today. [1]. The six supporters: Stephanie Golder from London, Louise Harris from Harpenden, Sean Irish from London, Peter Lay from Hampshire, Louis McKechnie from Manchester and Bethany Mogie from St Albans, appeared before Judge Stephen Mooney after having pleaded guilty to committing criminal damage at Cobham service station on 28th April 2022 [2] The six were given sentences of between 6 months and 17 months suspended for 18 months, 200 hours community service and costs of £526. Louis McKechnie and Bethanie Mogie received the longest suspended sentences of 17 months and 15 months respectively [3] In his mitigation statement to the court Louis McKechnie said: “In school I was taught about the Suffragettes, and I was taught about the Nazis. The suffragettes employed the same tactics we do and were punished harshly for it, but due to their efforts and their valuing ethics over the laws of the times, they made this country a better place for generations to come”. Xavier Gonzalez-Trimmer who took part in the action died in February of this year, in the run up to the original trial date. Louis McKechnie read out a tribute to his friend as part of his mitigation statement. Passing sentence today Judge Stephen Mooney said that “it was always my intention to have regard for the motivations [behind the actions]” however, he indicated that if the defendants had pleaded not guilty and then been found guilty at trial he would have been obliged to imprison them. The Judge said that he was less concerned about the potential damage to Shell’s profits and more with the inconvenience caused to the general public, but declined to impose compensation orders as he said that the defendants would not be able to pay. A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said “More and more ordinary people understand what those involved in our judicial system do not and that is that no-one is safe from the consequences of runaway global heating. You might feel immune from extreme heat waves and mass crop failure, but in the end we will all see our children starve and have to face riots and war. “Why, then, is the legal system aiding and abetting our criminal government in persecuting ordinary people trying to protect humanity when we should all be working together to deal with the impacts of climate breakdown and societal collapse?” Our leaders cannot continue to ignore and exacerbate this crisis by encouraging new oil and gas, while floods and fires consume everything we hold dear.

"116","‘For health’s sake- Just Stop Oil!’- Health professionals paint dinosaur, demanding an end to new oil and gas",2023-10-26,"Two medical professionals have painted a dinosaur at the National History Museum in London. They are demanding the government halt all new oil and gas projects in the UK and are calling on health professionals and the public to march in London from the 30th October to make this happen. [1] At approximately 1:50 pm this afternoon, Dr Will Stableforth, a consultant gastroenterologist and Steve Fay, a senior physiotherapist, used a children’s powder-paint fountain to cover a reproduction Titanosaur skeleton in orange cornstarch. The two then displayed a banner which read ‘For health’s sake- Just Stop Oil.’ The two then sat and waited for police to arrive. Fifteen officers have attended the scene and arrested both men. Speaking before the action, Dr Will Stableforth from Truro, in Cornwall, said: “As an NHS medical consultant I’ve spent many years looking after patients with diseases which, at their root, are caused by fossil fuels. I have done everything legal I can to get our message across. Most of that has been ineffective; so it’s time to break the law. I cannot see another way at this time.” “The climate crisis is a healthcare emergency for every single one of us. We demand an end to any new fossil fuels and immediate climate action prioritising public health rather than big business.” This morning, over 200 health journals from around the world, have urged the World Health Organization to declare the deadly climate and nature crises as a global health emergency. The journals have come together to simultaneously publish an editorial calling on world leaders and health professionals to treat the climate and and nature crises as one indivisible crisis that must be tackled together in order to preserve health and avoid catastrophe. [2] Also taking action today, Steve Fay, from the Hebrides, said: “Like this long extinct dinosaur, we are in grave danger of following in its footsteps. We know we are in a climate emergency with breakdowns in weather patterns and deaths of millions on the near horizon, yet our government pursues ever greater exploitation of oil and gas reserves.” “If we don’t act now, the repercussions will grow ever larger. As a health professional I know this will cause great suffering and death for many millions of people. I have made the decision to take non-violent direct action because I have a moral obligation as a healthcare professional to do all that I can to prevent harm.” Today’s action comes in the wake of the High Court rejecting a legal challenge on Friday, brought by Uplift and Greenpeace, to the Government’s decision to endorse new offshore oil and gas. The following day saw the UK’s most senior paediatrician, Dr. Camilla Kingdon, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, criticise the government for the ‘rolling back of net zero policies’, stating that the climate crisis poses an “existential risk to the health and wellbeing of all children.” She added, “Every child is at grave risk of the effects of our changing climate, but none more so than children in lower-income families.” A report published last year by UNICEF describes how already, over a billion children’s lives are at ‘extremely high risk’ from climate breakdown. [3][4] Child safeguarding frameworks should ensure that the welfare of children is prioritised in all decisions made by local authorities and their partners, and yet health workers and parents in the UK are increasingly expected to tolerate the clear and increasing harms to children, which include physical harms from chemical and air pollution, heat stress and hunger, and emotional harms due to eco-anxiety and trauma. Health professionals have a professional obligation to ‘take prompt action if patient safety is being compromised’, and to ‘be honest and act with integrity’. Health workers have a long and celebrated tradition of engaging in nonviolent disruptive protest, from John Snow, who was the grandfather of medical activism in 1854, through to the doctors arrested in the 1980’s for re-messaging cigarette advertising billboards. These actions have sought (and often succeeded) in protecting life and wellbeing. The action taken today continues in this spirit, and demands, for all our Health, Just Stop Oil. In November, we are calling for daily marches in London until the government comes to its senses and ends new oil and gas. Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join in civil resistance.

"117","An Open Letter to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley",2023-10-26,"[email protected]26th October 2023 Dear Sir Mark Rowley, Just Stop Oil supporters will remain in civil resistance until you prosecute the criminals responsible for crimes against humanity and acts of genocide The facts are clear. New oil and gas licensing in 2023 will kill hundreds of millions of people, adding to the already mounting global death toll from climate breakdown. It will push our climate, oceans and the living world beyond the point of no return, triggering runaway global heating and setting in motion an unstoppable process of global societal collapse. To know these facts and still encourage drilling for UK new oil and gas is reckless and immoral. There can be no greater crime. Of course, the politicians planning to max out the UK’s oil and gas reserves are not directly seeking mass death, neither are those executives signing off on plans to drill for new oil and gas or finance and insure new oil exploration. The primary aim of their support for fossil fuels is profit and power. To them, it’s an inconvenient side effect that millions and eventually billions of people will die when carbon emissions from new oil and gas cause heat waves, drought and crop failure. But under International Criminal Law, this is no mere side effect: it is murder by oblique intent. Under Article 30 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, death or harm doesn’t have to be a primary intention for someone to be held criminally responsible. They simply have to be ‘aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events’. Since 2021 when the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) declared that there could be no new oil, gas or coal if we want an even chance of limiting global temperature rise in line with the Paris Agreement, it has been abundantly clear that new oil and gas will lead to mass death. In 2022 you received a dossier of evidence requesting you investigate and charge five top British politicians for crimes against humanity and genocide. You have declined to do so. We say to you now that you already have all the evidence you need to prosecute those politicians and to launch an investigation into those executives signing off on plans to drill for new oil and gas or to finance and insure new oil exploration. If you are uncertain who they are, Just Stop Oil will be publishing a list on Sunday 29th October to assist in your enquiries. Failure to act will force Just Stop Oil into full non-compliance with the police and judicial system and we will remain in civil resistance until such time as you launch an investigation and bring charges. As Metropolitan Police Commissioner you promised to police “without favour or prejudice”. We are asking you now to uphold your oath and uphold the law: it is a matter of life and death. Respectfully yours, Just Stop Oil Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"119","Just Stop Oil supporters paint the Wellington Arch to demand an end to new oil and gas.",2023-10-25,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters have painted the Wellington Arch to demand the UK government immediately halt all new oil and gas projects and to call on the public to march in London from 29th October. [1] At approximately 10:15 this morning, three Just Stop Oil supporters set off smoke flares and sprayed orange paint on the Wellington Arch, using fire extinguishers. They then displayed banners reading ‘Just Stop Oil’ and waited for police to arrive and arrest them. Wellington Arch, also known as the Constitution Arch or Green Park Arch, is a Grade I-listed triumphal arch designed by Decimus Burton, that forms a centrepiece of Hyde Park Corner in central London, between the corner where Hyde Park meets Green Park. One of those taking action this morning is Joshua Lane, 26, an engineer from Sheffield. He said: “I am compelled to take action due to the severity, and sheer emergency we find ourselves in today. Future generations live in uncertainty, and we are given false promises time after time by endless pantomime governments. Humanity faces the biggest crisis in history, and yet the government continuously ignores the facts, and only thinks of themselves and the billionaire oil barons they serve. One thing that cannot be ignored is the power of ordinary people, and our voices are only continuing to grow louder.” Also taking action today was Joe Hogan, 40, from Hertfordshire. He said: “I’m angry. I’m anxious. I’m depressed. We are out of time; we have to act now. Not tomorrow, not next year, not 2050; NOW. But our government continues with business-as-usual, burning our futures to enrich their friends, while enacting draconian legislation to stamp out dissent. I refuse to be cowed. Traditional, managed, sanitised forms of protest have done nothing; the only way forward is through sustained, disruptive civil resistance. That’s why I will be marching in London from the 29th October and you should too. Sign up at juststopoil.org“ Today’s action comes as extreme weather continues to disrupt the UK, killing at least seven and leaving hundreds homeless after around 1,250 properties have flooded in England. The environment agency has issued more than 300 flood alerts and a new wave of heavy rain could bring flooding and disruption to much of London and southern England according to a fresh Met Office weather warning. In recent days, there have been cancellations and severe delays to rail services across the country, with King Cross station being evacuated due to overcrowding as people attempted to travel north. Recent analysis has found that damage caused by the climate crisis through extreme weather has cost $16m (£13m) an hour for the past 20 years. It found average costs of $140bn (£115bn) a year from 2000 to 2019. [2][3] Our leaders cannot continue to ignore and exacerbate this crisis by drilling for new oil, while floods and fires consume everything we hold dear. In November, we are calling for daily marches in London until the government comes to its senses and stops new oil and gas. Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to join us in civil resistance.

"120","Day Two for the M25 Injunction break hearing",2023-10-24,"The morning of Day 2 at the M25 injunction breach hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, saw more complex, technical legal discussion around who knew what and when. Three Just Stop Oil supporters are admitting breaching the injunction; Daniel Johnson, Paul Bell and Mair Bain. When the court returned after lunch, three of the 12 Just Stop Oil supporters (Former teacher and Quaker Gaie Delap 76, Rosemary Jackson 25, Charlotte Kirin (an Independent Social Worker) gave evidence and were cross examined. It took two and half hours. The other defendants will be cross examined tomorrow. Outside the court Gaie Delap said “This is part of the government’s strategy to put the squeeze on, to try and stop us. We’re in serious climate trouble, look at the floods this week, and we’re walking into it deaf dumb and blind. I am very concerned about the Global South, about people who are losing everything. As a Quaker I need to tell the truth and act as her heart directs in a nonviolent way.” Judge Soole is hearing the case, the defendants are being represented by Mr Owen Greenhall (instructed by Hodge, Jones and Allen) and National Highways Ltd have more lawyers than you can shake a stick at.","https://juststopoil.org/2023/10/24/day-two-for-the-m25-injunction-break-hearing/",1
"121","Just Stop Oil supporters target law firm responsible for National Highway Ltd injunctions",2023-10-24,"At approximately 8:30am this morning three Just Stop Oil supporters entered the offices of the law firm DLA Piper, displayed banners and deposited a large amount of legal paperwork from a suitcase onto the floor.[1] Theresa Norton, 65, from Scarborough in Yorkshire, is one of the named defendants on the controversial National Highways Ltd M25 structures injunction. Today, she “returned to sender” the vast amount of paperwork she has received from the firm in connection with the injunction. Theresa is also appearing at the Royal Courts of Justice today along with 11 others accused of breaking the National Highways Ltd injunction when they climbed or attempted to climb gantries over the M25 in November 2022. [2][3] DLA Piper is an international Law firm that claims to have green credentials and yet they are the firm profiting the most from the civil law injunctions brought by the government against Insulate Britain, Stop HS2 and Just Stop Oil. Lawyers for DLA Piper charge the government between £90 and £412 per hour for their services, fees which the government then seeks to recoup from the people named on injunctions in the form of legal costs.  For example, lawyers acting for the government in respect of the National Highways Ltd M25 injunction originally sought costs of £727,574 against the 133 defendants. People named on injunctions are frequently faced with huge legal bills whether or not they broke the injunction. [4] In addition to legal costs running to tens of thousands, those convicted of breaking an injunction face up to 2 years in prison, an unlimited fine and seizure of assets. Many of those in court this week have already spent long periods on remand, experienced restrictive bail conditions and ankle tags and, in an apparent case of double jeopardy face trial for public nuisance in criminal courts in 2024/5. [5][6] A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said “More and more ordinary people understand what these lawyers apparently do not and that is that no-one is safe from the consequences of runaway global heating. Your fat salary might give you a few months respite from extreme heat waves and mass crop failure, but in the end we will all see our children starve and have to face riots and war. “Why, then, are lawyers aiding and abetting our criminal government in persecuting ordinary people trying to protect humanity when we should all be working together to deal with the impacts of climate breakdown and societal collapse? Lawyers must be responsible. Stop profiting from genocide” Two further hearings at the Royal Courts of Justice are scheduled for the remaining 32 people who participated in the M25 gantry actions in November 2022. Just Stop Oil supporters are not prepared to stand by and watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we care about. It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas. People are coming together from all over the UK to march day after day in London from 30th October. It’s People vs Oil!

"122","Just Stop Oil 12 in Court over M25 Injunction break",2023-10-24,"Monday 23rd October 2023, saw 12 Just Stop Oil supporters appear at the Royal Courts of Justice at the start of a 5 day civil hearing [1,2]. They are the first out of a group of 35 that have been summoned to the High Court accused of breaking a National Highways’ injunction when they climbed or attempted to climb gantries over the M25 in November 2022. [3][4] The Court spent the day in legal argument (of course it did) centred around two points. Mr Justice Soole finally ruled that the burden is on the defendants to prove they did not know about the injunction rather than on the claimant to prove they did. And this has to be proved to a civil standard ie on the balance of probabilities (not beyond reasonable doubt) A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said “The protection provided by the state, by the law for those who are flooding our towns and cities, disrupting our transport links and halting the harvest of everyday staple vegetables was on display today. Politics is failing us, we are no longer protected, we need to come together and form the real opposition so we can defend ourselves from the coming storm” Paul Bleach, one of the defendants said: “I’m a father of 2 and I’m here because I love my children. It can’t be business as usual because that will cause genocide and suffering. We’re in a crisis and we need to start acting like we are. Its basic common sense.” The punishment if found guilty is up to 2 years in prison, an unlimited fine and seizure of assets. They can also be required to pay legal costs running to tens of thousands. Many of the defendants have already spent long periods on remand, experienced restrictive bail conditions and are required to wear ankle tags. Their criminal trials for public nuisance in the crown courts are due to start 2024 and run into 2025. The case is expected to continue for the rest of the week.

"123","TELLING THE TRUTH SO WE CAN LEARN FROM MISTAKES – REFLECTIONS FIVE YEARS ON",2023-10-20,"This letter by Clare Farrell, Gail Bradbrook and Roger Hallam was published on 19th October 2023 on the Extinction Rebellion website – the original can be found here https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/10/19/reflections-5-years-on/ Telling the truth means being ready to accept when you have been led astray, got things wrong and so have to modify your views. Five years since the launch of Extinction Rebellion, this world we live in is changing so dangerously fast that it demands we revisit our assumptions and learn some painful lessons. It is now clear that 2023 is very likely to average more than 1.5 °C above a 1850-1900 baseline. Whilst emissions are still rising world wide. It is only through commitment to the truth that we might help humanity and wider life around as we enter a disturbing new era. We got something wrong. We were misled. So, we misled you too. Aerosol pollution matters decisively to our global climate. There are other factors deserving of more serious attention such as forest cloud seeding and ocean health. Many factors were sidelined by scientists who were narrowly focusing on CO2. In addition, IPCC processes did not find an adequate way to address issues of extreme risk where data was deemed insufficient or where there was higher uncertainty *, such as aerosols, methane release from permafrost, and feedbacks from wildfires or droughts rendering sinks incapable of sustaining their role in the system. This misled other scientists, academics and activists including us. Some of us have attempted over the years to responsibly communicate the extreme and cascading risks, and the severe consequences of not taking emergency action. Despite founding the movement on the precautionary principle we found ourselves being ground down. For years we were moderated, and moodsplained by experts from narrow disciplines who demanded we change our press releases, our lectures, and play down the reality and potential speed of catastrophic consequences. As we pass into the horrors of a 1.5 °C plus world, at least 10 years earlier than the worst official expectations, we realise we should have made a firmer stand. As we observe some top climatologists claiming we need to wait decades before accepting that the planet is 1.5 °C warmer, we also realise that silence about our disagreements is no longer an option for us, or the climate movement. Understanding how this repression happened is important. We would welcome any career climatologists, academics and journalists who undermined our communications in public to make amends, especially as they have influenced attitudes amongst those who judge us. But more importantly, for the sake of life on Earth we must tackle this emergency with our eyes wide open to everything that we need to do from this point forward. The rapid heating and extreme events of the last year demonstrate that overall predictions of institutionalised climate science were less accurate than the conclusions of generalist scholars and leading climate activists, who better saw the frightening signals through the noise produced from siloes, hierarchies, and privilege. Notably, economists, politicians and consultants pulled the conversation in the opposite direction to what was needed. Because these people carry an identity associated with ‘authority’ they were not challenged enough by journalists, lay people, or activists. XR was always about responding to the whole ecological emergency, not just the climate. We need to bring this back to the fore, as much for the climate as for nature. We need to prioritise preserving and growing forest cover, learning how to restore the oceans’ role in atmospheric modulation, experimenting with marine cloud brightening in the Arctic and exploring every option for climate restoration and cooling, and even consider reversing recent shipping fuel regulations if they are causing an aerosol ‘termination shock’. And at the same time we must reject the lie that high consumption societies do not need to power down equitably, with the rich going first. We waste vast amounts of energy, which is unspeakable in these circumstances. The rallying cry from here on is that we Must Stop Oil, end the fossil fuel era, and we must also urgently start the repair of Planet Earth, our only home. We are entering a new era for humanity and the prospects are terrifying. We committed five years ago in October 2018 to live in truth. Our movements need to look directly at that truth and act according to reality. That means being in resistance, standing for peace, justice and freedom. Signed: Clare Farrell, Gail Bradbrook, Roger Hallam.

"124","Just Stop Oil delays refugees from being detained on the Bibby Stockholm",2023-10-19,"Just Stop Oil supporters temporarily blocked the coach transporting asylum seekers to the Bibby Stockholm barge, docked at the Isle of Portland in Dorset. At 12.45pm today, 23 people blocked traffic on Portland Beach Road, before moving in front of the coach carrying people who are seeking asylum in the UK. A banner that read ‘No Prison Ships’ was unfurled in front of the coach and ‘Demand Humanity’ at the back. Just Stop Oil supporters in the road were repeatedly driven into, resulting in them leaving the carriageway for their own safety. Three have been arrested. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “We know that our government’s plan for new oil and gas is going to lead to more people being displaced from their homes. Forced from where they have lived for generations due to the actions of our failing politicians. People coming to the UK must be met with common humanity, and not housed in prison ships. This is a slide towards concentration camps and we will not let it happen, not on our watch. We are taking action today to show love and solidarity with all people coming to this country. Responding to displaced people with cruel schemes like Bibby Stockholm, the Rwanda plan, or filthy barrack housing is not a solution. The best way to prevent people from being forced out of their homelands is to stop our governments from planning and implementing climate disasters, while protecting people’s right to move and seek safety. The first step is stopping new oil and gas” Merseyside Solidarity Knows No Borders stated: “Just as the humanitarian crisis unfolds in Gaza, we call for justice, human rights and adherence to international law in Israel, in Gaza, in the UK, all over the world. We call upon Bibby Marine to cease profiting from human misery and to pull out of their contract with the Home Office to lease the Bibby Stockholm for use as a prison ship.” Reclaim the Seas stated: “Seeking asylum is not a crime – it is a human right enshrined in international law. Yet this government wants to treat people coming to our shores seeking safety as criminals, forcing them onto a cramped, dangerous, floating prison-barge. As an organisation working closely with people seeking asylum who have experienced trauma at sea, we deplore the Bibby Stockholm. It is performative cruelty against a vulnerable group, and we believe it is necessary to take action to prevent people from being put through even more trauma on their journeys to seek safety.” On August 2nd, Ben Selby, Assistant General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union wrote to Suella Braverman stating the opposition held by the FBU against the Bibby Stockholm, comparing it to the Grenfell tragedy in terms of danger: “We are concerned about the risks of a large floating structure used to accommodate asylum seekers in long-term housing… We have substantial expertise, including from earlier disasters such as the Grenfell Tower fire and the subsequent public inquiry. We are concerned above all to prevent another tragedy and to guarantee public safety.” [1] He later remarked “Firefighters believe the Bibby Stockholm to be a potential deathtrap”. [2] Supporters of Just Stop Oil took action as a result of an open letter written by the first residents of the Bibby Stockholm, explaining the dire state of the accommodation and requesting “support and unity”.

Indigo Rumbelow and Roger Hallam were arrested in separate raids this morning after police forced entry to their homes, searched belongings and confiscated papers. A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “We will not be intimidated by our criminal government. Not content with cheering on war crimes in Gaza, by maxing out our oil and gas reserves they are complicit in the greatest crime in human history. New oil and gas will result in unimaginable suffering and destroy the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. No one has ever voted for this, there has never been a democratic mandate to destroy the habitable world. “Just Stop Oil supporters are deeply committed to stopping all new oil and gas. If our government refuses to do what is right to protect humanity, then people will step up to do what needs to be done. “The painful truth right now is that our politicians and corporations have no intention of acting in accordance with the fundamental interests of either our young people or the country as a whole. Whether those in charge realise that they are commiting the crime of genocide, is not the question. For this is how it will be seen by the next generation and all future generations. Our friends in police custody and languishing in prison understand this very well as do we.” New oil and gas will push the world past irreversible tipping points, destroy our ability to grow food and result in the collapse of organised civil society. Everything we know and love is threatened. To allow any new oil and gas, in full knowledge of these consequences, isn’t just a crime against humanity. It is the greatest crime in human history.

"126","‘This isn’t a game’: Just Stop Oil disrupt Tekken final at UK’s biggest gaming event",2023-10-15,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters coated a giant screen with orange paint at major games expo EGX 2023. They are demanding the UK Government halts all new oil and gas projects, and are calling on gamers to march with Just Stop Oil in London this November. [1] Today at 15:48pm, cosplaying as ‘Ghostbusters’ characters, the three used adapted water pistols to target a viewing screen for the Tekken 7 tournament winner’s final being held at ‘The Arena’ stage in London’s Excel conference centre. They were escorted out by venue security, before being arrested for Criminal Damage by the Metropolitan Police. A Just stop Oil spokesperson said:“Video games let us escape into new and exciting dimensions, but real world physics are about to deliver the deaths of billions. Put more carbon into the atmosphere at this point and it’s game over. Gamers co-operate to win, and we need these skills to survive. Everyone must step up and join in civil resistance against new oil and gas, because this isn’t a game. Let’s unite to make this world safe, so that we can get back to exploring cyber worlds. Join Just Stop Oil on a slow march through London from 29th October”  Idris, a 20 year old artist from London, was one of those taking action today. They said: “It is vital that we draw as much attention as possible to the genocidal decisions the government is making. I won’t stand aside while billions are sentenced to death and neither should you.” “When I hear about the climate crisis and the number of people who will be displaced and die I can’t fit the numbers into my head. Instead, I think of my Mam, Dad, Brother, and friends. All the people I love who are threatened by the climate catastrophe are the reason I am committed to civil disobedience.” EGX 2023 is sponsored by Barclays Bank, who have been described at the “Europe’s number 1 financier of the climate crisis”. They have financed around $167 billion in fossil fuels. Moreover, Shell sponsors popular game Fortnite as well as gaming influencers. Children and teen players are directed to fuel up at digital Shell stations, in a promotion for a new petrol product. Shell’s planned emissions from 2018 to 2030 are estimated to account for close to 1.6% of the global carbon budget. [2] [3] [4] Another of those taking action today was Luke Watson, 32. The handyman from Essex said: “There’s been 30 years of consensus on what needs to be done and we’ve done almost nothing in that time. Hope is something you have to earn and we haven’t done enough. If you believe in hope what will you do?” “The Dutch have just had a massive win using civil disobedience, we can do the same. We just have to live and act as if something depended on it because everything does.” Just Stop Oil supporters are not prepared to stand by and watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we care about.

"127","Just Stop Oil students continue campaign of resistance calling on university students and staff to March in London",2023-10-12,"Three student Just Stop Oil supporters have painted buildings belonging to Manchester University, Cambridge University and University of Leeds. They are demanding the UK Government immediately halt planned new oil and gas projects and are calling on students and faculty staff to march with Just Stop Oil in London this November. [1] At around 11:15 in Manchester, 19 year old Ruby Hamill spray painted the Allen Gilbert building (informally known as the Ali-G building) using a fire extinguisher. She then used her hands to paint ‘Just Stop Oil’ on the windows, before an armed unit of police, and over 20 officers in total, arrived in six cars and one van to arrest her. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Ruby is a 19 year old supporter of Just Stop Oil. Like everyone who takes action with Just Stop Oil she has undertaken nonviolence training and is accountable for her actions. Contrast this with the heavy handed response of the authorities. Sending armed police and over 20 officers to arrest one slight young girl is a massive state overreach. It shows how scared they are that young people are resisting a government that is intent on destroying Ruby’s entire generation. Young people have every right to defend themselves and those they love against this government that is intent on killing millions for profit. Students across the country are stepping into action and marching with us in November. Sign up at juststopoil.org/students.” Students are demanding that university leaders make a public statement calling on the government to end new oil and gas projects, and make a commitment to join their students in marching on the streets of London, if the government fails to respond. It was recently revealed that UK universities have taken £40m in fossil fuel funding since 2022. Manchester University has received £3,077,268, Cambridge has received £2,821,437 and Leeds has received £418,881. [2] Speaking before taking action today Ruby Hamill said: “I’m taking action to call out the hypocrisy of Manchester Uni, an academic institution which is fundamentally betraying its students. Taking money from oil and gas firms means being complicit in their greenwashing.” “This summer we all watched as thousands of Libyans were washed out into the ocean, and fires annihilated life on Maui. Immense suffering is a reality now for millions. This is why students across the country are stepping into action and marching with us in November.” At around midday today, Chiara Sarti, a PhD student working in the department of Computer Science at Cambridge, used a fire extinguisher to spray orange paint over the iconic neo gothic gatehouse at King’s College. Meanwhile, at around 12:50, Sam Holland, a former student at the University of Leeds who studied Human Geography, used a fire extinguisher to paint the Great Hall at Leeds University. Speaking ahead of her action, Chiara Sarti, 24 who lives in London, said: “New oil and gas is a death sentence. Young people have been completely betrayed. The government is enacting policies that will destroy my generation. We have a moral imperative to do whatever it nonviolently takes to stop them.” “I’m doing this for my niece. By the time she grows up, we’ll have complete annihilation locked in. I cannot stand by while we can still do something to avoid the worst impacts of this disaster.” Speaking before taking action at Leeds today, Sam Holland said: “I’m taking action today because universities are lying to us. I studied Human Geography & Economics and was not told that hundreds of millions will be killed over the coming decades from famine, fire and war over resources because of the climate crisis. We have been betrayed by academics and university executives that are too cowardly to tell the truth, let alone take action to stop it.” “The government licences genocidal new oil and gas drilling with no resistance from universities who research the starvation, social collapse and murder that it will result in. They have left it up to students to put their freedom on the line to fix the shit-show that they have created.” “Young people are done waiting for someone to change the situation for us. You have no idea what’s coming when the rest of my generation wakes up to the murderous betrayal by the ‘adults in the room’.” Just Stop Oil supporters are not prepared to stand by and watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we care about.

They are demanding the UK Government immediately halt planned new oil and gas projects and are calling on students and faculty staff to march with Just Stop Oil in London this November. [1] At around midday today, Arthur Clifton, an english literature graduate from Exeter University used a fire extinguisher to paint the UCL pillars orange.Meanwhile two students sprayed buildings belonging to Falmouth and Exeter Universities on the shared Penryn Campus. Holly Astle, an illustration graduate from Falmouth University, painted the vice chancellors office – The Link building. Whilst over the road Ethan Paul, a renewable energy engineering graduate from Exeter University, used buckets of paint and spray cans to spread orange paint over Exeter University’s Stella Turk building. In Birmingham, Harrison Donnelly has used buckets of paint and spray cans to paint the main University of Birmingham Library. While at Sussex University, Oscar Denman-Gould has used a fire extinguisher to paint the University of Sussex Library. It was recently revealed that UK universities have taken £40m in fossil fuel funding since 2022. Exeter University is the largest beneficiary of fossil fuel financial commitments since 2022, being in receipt of £14,700,000. [2] Speaking ahead of his action, Arthur Clifton, 22, who lives in London, said: “I cannot stand by in terror and do nothing as my entire generation is sold out for short-term profit. I wonder how long it is before my 10 year old sister has to face the food shortages and violence that so many across the globe are already facing in the wake of social breakdown brought on through climate collapse?” “Universities are supposed to develop and protect their students and young people, but instead they are sending us into the furnace. The academic research has been done, and it could not be clearer. If these institutions listened to their own staff, they would know how crucial it is that we immediately halt all new oil and gas licences. Instead, they accept millions in funding from oil and gas corporations.” Students are demanding that university leaders make a public statement calling on the government to end new oil and gas projects, and make a commitment to join their students in marching on the streets of London, if the government fails to respond. Speaking before taking action today, Holly Astle, 28, who lives in Falmouth, said: “Universities are meant to have a duty of care over their students, but are failing miserably as they set them up for a future that won’t exist. What are they doing to prepare the youth for the prospect of climate breakdown and civilisational collapse? Universities are responsible for sustaining a double reality of recognising the existence of the crisis, without feeling any incentive to act on it.” “We are angry that universities continue to prop up the government as they drill for new oil in an act of violence against the young. Students and staff alike must join us in civil resistance to stand up against this injustice. This is what students across the country are doing, step up and march with us in November.

Meanwhile, George Simonson, 23, a mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Edinburgh, used buckets of paint and spray cans to paint the glass facade of ‘The Forum’ on the Exeter University campus. Speaking ahead of his action, Daniel Knorr, who studies at Oxford University, said: “I am taking action to resist the destruction of my generation. Oxford academics are fully aware of the scale of the climate crisis – this year Oxford scientists said that in a few years climate breakdown will routinely expose people to unsurvivable heat and humidity. In other words, hundreds of millions of people will be forced to move, or die. This is mass murder. It is genocide. It is no good to study the annihilation of everything we care about and do absolutely nothing about it, we have to act!” [2][3] Students are demanding that university leaders make a public statement calling on the government to end new oil and gas projects, and make a commitment to join their students in marching on the streets of London, if the government fails to respond. Speaking before taking action today, George Simonson, who lives in London, said: “Studying engineering taught me that we already already have the solutions to address the climate crisis, what we lack is the political will. The politicians have been bought, and educational institutions are absolutely complicit in allowing them to continue this genocide. Universities are accepting tens of millions in dirty money and letting the fossil fuel companies come to careers fairs to give out free pens! Students have a duty to step up and show teaching institutions we won’t stand for it anymore.” “Taking action gives me hope. One person has the power to put shockwaves through the system and challenge the status quo.

This is what students across the country are doing, step up and march with us in November. Sign up at juststopoil.org/students.” Recent reports have revealed that major fossil fuel companies have committed tens of millions of pounds in funding to UK universities since 2022. The University of Exeter has received the most from fossil fuel firms since 2022, having signed a £14.7m, five-year deal with Shell in November for a project on “carbon storage and sequestration”. Oxford University was found to have received £1,209,221 in fossil fuel financial commitments since 2022.

He is calling on students and faculty staff to march with Just Stop Oil in London this November, against the UK Government’s plans to licence new oil and gas projects. [1] At around 11:50 today, Ben Meehan, 21, a filmmaking student at UWE, sprayed the glass facade of the historic Queen’s Building on campus as students and staff looked on. Three police cars arrived and six policemen arrested Ben after his action. Speaking ahead of his action, Ben, who lives in Bristol, said: “I’m taking action because I can’t stand by while universities are complicit with the very systems that are destroying everything we care about. We have to begin behaving like we are in the emergency that we are in. We haven’t got long and there is no bigger threat.” Today’s action comes in the wake of an ultimatum issued to all University Vice Chancellors in the United Kingdom on the 18th September. Students are demanding that University leaders make a public statement calling on the government to end new oil and gas projects, and make a commitment to join their students in marching on the streets of London if the government fails to respond. A student Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “University leaders have ignored our letter and as such have demonstrated their willingness to collaborate with a government that is engaging in genocide. By propping up “business as usual” – and refusing to engage emotionally in what’s coming for their students – our lecturers and universities are complicit in the wholesale destruction of our future. Put simply, they’re fucking us over. Business as usual means we won’t enjoy any of the privileges they’ve had. No food, no family, no future. There will be no research on a dead planet, no lectures when we’re fighting each other over our next meal.” “We know we’re in the shit. But we refuse to give up. We know that if we act now, in solidarity with each other, then there’s still a glimmer of hope to hang on to. Hope is our birthright and we refuse to give up on it. We call on every student, lecturer, and university employee to face reality and act accordingly.” “Young people are sick and tired of waiting for meaningful action. We have been failed, left in a situation that is beyond fucked. But instead of backing down, we will unite, come together and fight back. Young people are stepping into civil resistance on campuses all over the country. We are calling on university leaders to do the right thing and join their students in civil resistance against this criminal government. It is time for students and faculty staff to march with Just Stop Oil this November in London, when we will end new oil and gas. Visit juststopoil.org/students to sign up.” Last week, it was revealed that despite many UK universities pledging to divest from fossil fuels, institutions are still accepting funding from these companies in research grants, tuition fees, and consultancy fees to the tune of £40 million since 2022. [2] A year after it pledged to divest from fossil fuels, Bristol University was the first in the UK to declare a climate emergency in 2019. However, it’s come under fire in recent months for continuing to manage millions of pounds in student fees, research funding and staff salaries through Barclays Bank. As the seventh biggest funder of fossil fuels in the world, Barclays has poured more than $190bn (about £156bn) into the industry since the Paris Agreement. [3] In 2021, Bristol University’s student newspaper, Epigram, conducted research that showed that over 70% of students reported suffering from climate anxiety. Over half said it affected their feelings about having a family.

"131","The show can’t go on: an open letter to my colleagues in the theatre industry",2023-10-05,"by Chloe Naldrett Yesterday (4 October), student supporters of Just Stop Oil disrupted the evening performance of Les Misérables.  As a supporter and spokesperson for Just Stop Oil I have spoken in defence of actions in galleries and on sports pitches.  This is a tough one for me because I am also a Theatre Producer, with a 22-year career in the industry we all love.  It’s awful to watch artists and audiences disrupted in this way. But in response to this action it is time for us all to decide who we are. Les Misérables tells the story of students in France in 1832 who rose up against a government which could no longer govern in the best interests of the people.  A government which imprisoned people for stealing food for a child.  A government which lived in luxury while women were forced to sell their hair, their teeth and their bodies to support their children.  We know what inequality looked like then, we know what it looks like now, and we know what it will look like in the future. The students who took action at the Sondheim are in exactly the same position as the students in the show: we cannot admire Marius and his comrades without also admiring them.  These young people see a government which is prioritising its own interests while destroying the hope that they have for their future.  They see a system which is rigged against them.  They see a government which, against the clear warnings of the UN, the WHO, the International Energy Agency and the world’s climate scientists, is opening 100 new oil and gas fields in the North Sea to “max out our oil and gas reserves”, while fossil-fuel induced climate breakdown accelerates all around us.  And they will not accept it. This show cannot go on. The students who took this action did so out of desperation. They would not normally wish to disrupt the work of talented creative professionals or an audience who have paid to see a show they love – but these are not normal times.   Supporters of Just Stop Oil take actions like this because all other attempts at raising our voices and demanding change have failed.  We do it because the magnitude of the existential crisis we are in demands that we throw our bodies onto the line. Like the Parisian students of 1832, we are fighting for our lives. Les Misérables was the first West End show I watched, aged 16. This and the other shows I have watched over the last 27 years have taught me not to turn away in the face of injustice. They have taught me about the responsibility I have as a parent, as a professional, as a member of many communities, and as a human being not to stand aside while everything we love is destroyed.  If we do not have clear air, clean water, good food to eat and safe places to live, then nothing else matters – and right now all those basic needs are under threat from the impacts of global heating (or ‘global boiling’ as Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the UN, is now calling it). As artists and representatives of cultural institutions, we are responsible for telling stories which reflect the world around us.  And right now we are fighting for our lives, the lives of our children, and the lives of people around the world who have experienced the terror of climate breakdown at first hand this summer.  What are our responsibilities, as an industry and as individuals at this terrifying time, as our Government pushes us further and further in the wrong direction? I’ve written this letter in the hope that it will be shared with colleagues across the theatre community, so that they can make up their own minds about the value of the action taken last evening.  I invite you to stand with Just Stop Oil, and in support of the young people who took action at the Sondheim.  I acknowledge the stress and the anger that will have been experienced – this action would not have been taken lightly, and this letter is not written lightly either. People are coming together from all over the UK to march day after day in London from 29th October. Its People vs Oil! Sign up at JustStopOil.org Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030.

"132","“The show can’t go on”- Just Stop Oil supporters interrupt ‘Les Mis’",2023-10-04,"This evening, five Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted a staging of the iconic musical ‘Les Misérables’ at the Sondheim Theatre in Westminster. Just like revolutionaries featured in the story, they are calling on everyone to take a stand against the government’s criminal plans to “max out our oil and gas reserves” and to join in civil resistance against new fossil fuels. [1] During the performance of ‘Do You Hear The People Sing?’, five Just Stop Oil supporters entered the stage carrying orange banners reading ‘Just Stop Oil’ and ‘The Show Can’t Go On’. They emerged during the song’s crescendo, amongst actors bearing revolutionary red flags. At around 8:50pm they locked themselves to the set using flexible bicycle locks, which theatre technicians were unable to remove. The performance was halted, and the theatre was evacuated by 9:10pm.23 year old community worker Hannah Taylor is one of those who took action today. They said:“The show starts with Jean Valjean stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal loaves of bread? How long before there are riots on the streets? The show cannot go on. We are facing catastrophe. New oil and gas means crop failure, starvation and death. It is an act of war on the global south and an utter betrayal of young people.” “Rishi Sunak has just approved Rosebank, a new oil project in the north sea which will produce as much carbon as the annual emissions of the 28 lowest-income countries combined. It will lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths due to starvation as crops fail in the increasingly extreme weather conditions.” “Am I not, like Jean Valjean, justified in breaking the law to oppose this criminal government and its murderous policies? Ask yourself, will you, like the citizens of Paris in the play, stand by and watch, or will you stand up against our governments’ criminal plans and call for an end to new oil and gas?” ‘Les Misérables’ depicts a society where hardworking people struggle to afford food, and they’re ruled by widely-despised unelected leaders who repress democracy, while amassing wealth for themselves and their cronies. This could describe the United Kingdom under Rishi Sunak and his reign of climate chaos. On the 20th of September, Sunak announced a staggering rowback on green policies, hot on the heels of his promise to licence 100 new fossil fuel projects in the United Kingdom. These decisions, made without a democratic mandate, are genocidal. [2] Another of those taking action today was Poppy Bliss, 19, a student from Nottingham. She said: “I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I am absolutely terrified for my future. I don’t want to be disrupting people’s evenings out, but I have been left with no other choice. Our government is betraying the young and putting everyone’s futures on the line for the sake of a few votes. I am doing this because I am desperate.” “We are frighteningly close to losing everything we love. Everything we know will be destroyed by climate collapse. I cannot do nothing and just watch that happen. I want a liveable future for my generation and the generations to come. The show cannot go on.” We are not prepared to stand by and watch while the government plans for millions to die and destroys everything we love.  It’s up to all of us now to come together and resist. We cannot let them divide us. Together we can be the real opposition this country needs and we will win. We will stop new oil and gas.

"133","Solicitor General’s prosecution of Trudi Warner for holding sign sparks mass public resistance",2023-09-25,"More than 250 to replicate her action on Monday as civil society, legal and mental health professionals rally round Public and civil society to defy Solicitor General’s attempt to deter sign holding outside court If Michael Tomlinson KC, the Solicitor General, hoped that prosecuting Trudi Warner, a 68 year old retired social worker from Walthamstow, East London would deter others from doing the same thing, it’s not going to plan for him. On Monday, 25 September, a matter of days after the announcement of his decision to apply for the committal to prison of Ms Warner, for holding up a sign, more than 250 members of the public are replicating her action outside criminal courts around the country (including in London, Bristol and Manchester) as part of the growing public campaign, Defend Our Juries. Meanwhile many others, including the Climate Psychology Alliance and a Professor of Law have spoken out. One of those risking prison by holding a sign on Monday, Dr Abi Perrin, a scientist, said: “In 2023 telling the truth is being treated as a criminal act, with people prosecuted for displaying facts in public, and imprisoned for explaining their motivations in their own defence in a court of law. I am deeply afraid of a world where truth, science and morality are not important, or where we are not free to fight for them.” Three generations of women take a stand together Three generations of women from one Bristol family plan to hold signs outside Bristol Crown Court. Of her decision to attend, Sarah MacDonald (56) said: “I love it that I can attend with my mother and my daughter, representing the power and continuity of Life, which we are all committed to serving and protecting.” Renee Slater (grandmother, 84) said: “The repression of legitimate protest must still, and always be resisted.” Vivi MacDonald (granddaughter, 19) said: “The continuous measures by the government to limit protest are threatening everyone’s freedom and ability to take action or express their opinion based on our own conscience in the light of the urgent need for social, political and environmental change” Civil Society, legal and mental health professionals rally round Alongside those replicating Trudi Warner’s action directly, others have expressed support in public statements. More than 50 members of the Climate Psychology Alliance have publicly written to Mr Tomlinson to say: “In the current context, we consider that Trudi Warner’s action was both appropriate and proportionate and we would be prepared to act in a similar way.” The Barrister magazine has published an article by Richard Vogler, Professor of Comparative Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, University of Sussex, “We are All Trudi Warner! Promoting the Rights of Jurors in the Twenty First Century”, which begins: “George Orwell noticed the tendency of repressive law to degenerate into farce, when truth becomes a lie and common sense is heresy. This is worth remembering today, when the Solicitor General, Michael Tomlinson KC, has concluded that it is a prosecutable offence for a climate campaigner, Trudi Warner to hold up a sign outside a criminal court, simply proclaiming one of the fundamental principles of the common law; the right of a jury to decide a case according to its conscience.” More than 150 people have signed a petition on change. org, “Please charge me” in solidarity with Trudi Warner.” Others have spoken out on social media. Dr James Dyke, Associate Professor in Earth System Science at Exeter University, said: “This would be laughable if it were not so frightening. People are facing arrest & prosecution for silently holding up signs that simply state the legal rights of juries – one of the central pillars of the UK criminal legal system!”, Paul Powlesland, a practising barrister and member of the Bar Council, said: “It’s absurd overreach and an appalling assault on freedom of speech for the police to threaten members of the public with serious criminal charges just for holding up signs with the law on them. This will have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression everywhere.” Backdrop of escalating repression This show or public resistance comes against a background of increasing repression in Britain. In March, The Times warned that “Protest laws ‘put UK on a par with El Salvador’”. In April, the UN urged the British government to reverse its ‘deeply troubling’ new laws clamping down on freedom of assembly and expression. And in August it emerged that German courts are refusing to extradite to the UK over human rights violations in British prisons. The US journalist, Amy Westervelt, has recently linked this rising repression to the influence of fossil fuel industry think-tanks, such as Policy Exchange, on the British government. Dilemma for the authorities as members of public launch Defend Our Juries campaign Monday’s united front from the public presents Mr Tomlinson, the police and the courts with a dilemma. If holding these signs is really a serious criminal offence, amounting to interference with the course of justice, punishable with life imprisonment, then all who do so should be arrested and prosecuted. But arresting so many people for upholding simple and truthful signs risks further backlash. In a recent consultation, over 80% of the public cited trial by jury as a fundamental British right (alongside access to free healthcare).

"134","Just Stop Oil supporters urge councillors to stop supporting the oil industry and wasting public money to crack down on peaceful protesters",2023-09-21,"Just Stop Oil supporters gathered outside the North Warwickshire Borough Council offices in Atherston today to draw attention to the council’s waste of public money in bringing the Kingsbury injunction and to ask councillors to ditch the injunction. [1] North Warwickshire Borough Council (NWBC) has spent a whopping £137,000 of public money on an entirely unnecessary injunction to prevent peaceful protest by Just Stop Oil supporters outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal near Tamworth. The Council has recently applied to the High Court to finalise the injunction which will mean yet more taxpayers money being spent.[2] The interim injunction, which was granted to North Warwickshire Borough Council (NWBC) on 14th April 2022, gives sweeping powers of arrest to the authorities and appears designed to help the state protect the profits of the oil industry by effectively outlawing any protest activity near the Kingsbury Terminal, the largest inland oil storage depot in the country.[3] This injunction was totally unnecessary because one of the main operators on the site, Valero Energy, had already been granted a High Court injunction to prevent the terminal being blocked. [4] Meanwhile, ordinary people who have a right to peaceful protest are being penalised. 159 ordinary people are named on the interim injunction and they may have to pay for NWBC’s legal costs in bringing the injunction even if they have never breached its terms.  [5] Breaching an injunction can lead to a contempt of court conviction, which is punishable by up to two years’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine and the seizure of assets. More than 50 Just Stop Oil supporters were sent to prison on one day in September 2022, after peacefully stopping traffic outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal last year.[6] Just stop Oil supporter, Xandra Gilchrist, 72, a retired Social Worker from Warwickshire said: “I’ve lived in Warwickshire for 40 years and I’m appalled about this waste of money.  If everyone knew about the huge amount of money being spent on this injunction, I’m sure the majority of people would be enraged.  I certainly am.” NWBC Councillor Steve Stuart said: “There is a need to address the difficult issue of the climate emergency which will affect everyone on the planet to a level that we may not yet fully appreciate until it is too late.” “The best way to stop disruptive protests on this matter is to address the concerns over climate change for the benefit of all who do not have a vested interest in the future of the oligarchs and oil companies.” Just stop Oil supporter Paul Sheeky, 48, a call centre operator from London said: “I just think it’s disgusting that the local council is using taxpayers’ money to help out a massive oil company that makes obscene profits.  I’m sure there’s local services that really could have made a much better use of that money than just punishing protestors, who at the end of the day, just want a liveable future for us all.” Dr Clare Walters, 66, a grandmother, councillor and CEO said: “Why am I and other peaceful protestors being punished by NWBC?  It seems like a waste of our council tax money.  Let the oil companies pay for their own security measures.” Just Stop Oil supporter, Karen Wildin said: “Why would NWB councillors agree to spend local taxes on trying to stop protestors from standing up for human survival?  Look at the floods happening everywhere!  We can all see that climate collapse is real.  We need to all be onside together for everybody’s sake!” Jeannie Donald-McKim, 59, Special Needs teacher said: “Local people need to be aware of what their taxes are being used for – a cynical ploy by fossil fuel companies to further curtail any voices of dissent while they destroy our liveable future.  But why did NWBC agree to be their puppets?” Meanwhile, Prime minister Rishi Sunak has been hatching a U-turn on the climate that has left other countries and green experts aghast. It is no longer possible to ignore the accelerating climate emergency after a summer of devastating wildfires and catastrophic floods around the world. [5] [6] [7] The government plans to licence over 100 new oil and gas projects despite mounting evidence that this will impose unimaginable suffering and destroy the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. New oil and gas will push the world past irreversible tipping points, destroy our ability to grow food and risk the collapse of human civilization. Everything we know and love is threatened. To pursue new oil and gas, in full knowledge of these consequences, isn’t just a crime against humanity. It is the greatest crime in human history. We will not let this stand. We refuse to die quietly. Civil resistance is no longer an option, it is a necessity. In late October, thousands of people will join Just Stop Oil in London to march on the roads, and we will not stop until we win.

"135","Call to Action for all University Vice Chancellors in the UK",2023-09-18,"Just Stop Oil students are calling on all University Vice Chancellors in the UK to read this open letter, and then sign the ultimatum that we’ve included below so that we may send it on to Rishi Sunak and Gillian Keegan. New oil and gas is genocide, and we are demanding that universities do not continue to be complicit. Dear Vice Chancellors, We are the student wing of Just Stop Oil. We are writing to you because we are disgusted by your failure to act to stop mass murder being committed by the UK government as it plans to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves. On 15th September the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, wrote a letter urging you to warn your students of the consequences that engaging in civil resistance could have for their futures. This letter urges you to face up to the far worse consequences coming down the line as a result of the government’s genocidal policies. Paper after academic paper spells out the annihilation that we now face: hundreds of millions starving to death, billions of people being forced to leave their homes. Students and young people face a future of global economic collapse, war, and social breakdown. You are complicit in this genocide. By partnering with fossil fuel companies, undertaking research for industrial agriculture, auto, aviation and defence industries, and sending delegates to useless COP conferences, your universities give the government and carbon corporations the veneer of respectability, and the social licence to carry on their project of mass death. You have failed to speak the truth about what is happening, and you have utterly failed to uphold the duty of care you have for your students. Contrast your cowardice with what happened in Norway, in 1942. Ten thousand teachers went on strike in resistance to the occupying Nazi regime. One thousand were rounded up and imprisoned, many sent to concentration camps, but they refused to comply. The resistance movement wrote in a pamphlet: “The calling of the teacher is not only to give them knowledge but also teach them to believe and strive for what’s true and right. Therefore they cannot, without failing their calling, teach what contradicts their conscience”. They knew that there are lines no government must ever cross. Now comes your moment to stand up against evil. It is time for you to put your head above the parapet and publicly announce that the government’s policies are criminal and condemn the next generation to obliteration. It is time for you to tell the truth, that new oil and gas means the end of everything. It is time for you to engage in civil resistance. In November, thousands of students will be arrested for marching in London. Many may be imprisoned. We demand that you sign the attached letter* which gives the government a clear ultimatum: either they stop new oil and gas licences, or you will be duty bound to join your students in slow marches across London to the point that you too will be arrested and imprisoned. If you do not sign and return the attached letter by Friday 22nd September, students will have no choice but to bring a wave of civil disobedience to their campuses. It is time for you to pick a side. Either you side with the government, and the education secretary who is responsible for allowing the UK’s places of education to physically crumble into disrepair – or you side with your students as they take action to protect their lives and their futures. You knew this moment was coming. We will not be complicit. Will you?

"136","An Open letter to the UK Police Unions",2023-09-13,"The climate crisis is here and now. Just this week in Libya 10,000 people were swept into the sea as an atmospheric river dumped 10cm of rain in just 3 days, while in Greece last week the same storm event turned rivers into raging torrents leaving 700km2 underwater and half the country cut off as roads and railways collapsed. The police and rescue services in Libya and Southern Europe are overwhelmed.  [1][2][3] At what point will you say enough is enough and demand action from your government? A Government that is planning to “max out the UK’s oil and gas reserves”, an action that will result in the deaths of countless millions while demanding that you detain those lawfully seeking to halt the mass murder. Just Stop Oil will be back on the streets of London from October 29th. You know what that means. We’ve been here before. Our 13 week campaign between April and July this year cost the Metropolitan Police more than £7.7m and required the equivalent of an extra 23,500 officer shifts. [4] The NPCC lead for Protest Policing Chief Constable Chris Noble has said “we’re not going to arrest our way out of environmental protest.” He is right. We urge the Police Federation to follow the example of their Dutch counterparts and demand that the government talk to Just Stop Oil. [5] Last week, in advance of massive protests on the A12 motorway in The Hague by Extinction Rebellion Netherlands, four Dutch police unions made an urgent appeal to their government to avert the blockades.[6] In an open letter shared with Extinction Rebellion, officials from the Dutch Police Federation, ANPV , Equipe and ACP asked politicians to negotiate with the group. They argued that managing the actions would require a disproportionate police deployment that the Netherlands can no longer afford and divert much needed police resources from their day to day work. Sound familiar? In what was a steadfastly apolitical letter, the Dutch police unions argued that politicians had failed to listen to Extinction Rebellion and urged them to “get over their pride and come out and talk to the citizens gathered there who so badly want to be heard and understood by them.” It concluded that: “Deploying the police to oversee climate demonstrations is carrying water to the sea and only leads to an even higher workload within the already overburdened force. Politics can prevent this by opening its doors, listening to concerned citizens and looking for a solution together.” We understand that here in the UK police officers are at breaking point. The strain of an ever rising workload, a real terms pay cut of 28% since 2010  and increasing incidents of assault has led to “unprecedented levels of mental exhaustion and mental ill health” within the police.  [7] We are ready to talk.

"137","Total lies to the students resisting the ultimate crime",2023-09-05,"“Thank you for your interest in our work”. That’s how Philippe Groueix, the man in charge of TotalEnergies’ East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), signed off his letter addressing the “concerns” of students in Uganda working to stop his company. Just a month earlier, one of the students was kidnapped for three days, beaten and interrogated. His crime? Delivering a petition to the Ugandan government against Philippe’s project. “We seek to encourage and assist NGOs in their activities as long as they are working lawfully and peacefully”, Groueix writes. Students Against EACOP Uganda are on the frontlines of the war against humanity. In a country where protest requires police authorisation, they are resolutely nonviolent. Meanwhile, EACOP has been formally condemned by the EU Parliament,1 while TotalEnergies is fighting allegations of violating the human rights of the people living in its 1443km path of destruction in French courts.2 More than 260 community and not-for-profit organisations have called for all financing of EACOP to stop, and many banks have agreed.3 Perhaps Philippe could identify which NGOs TotalEnergies will “encourage and assist”. There is nothing peaceful about the 379 million tonnes of carbon that EACOP will transport towards our atmosphere.4 But, Philippe claims, “during the energy transition, in which TotalEnergies is fully engaged, the world needs reasonably priced oil”. He says that, if EACOP doesn’t proceed, high energy prices could “significantly impact the lives of people in countries like Uganda”. He wants us to believe TotalEnergies is working for Ugandans, even referring (albeit unspecifically) to the International Energy Agency (IEA) to back this up. Never mind the fact that the IEA actually called for an end to all investment in oil and gas in 2021.5 Never mind the fact the IEA’s figures show that only 9.8% of Uganda’s energy comes from oil.6 Never mind the fact that the Ugandan government has claim to only 15% of the oil the pipeline will transport.7 Never mind the fact that TotalEnergies, and, in all likelihood, the Ugandan government, will export the oil to sell on international markets, at international prices. Why lie, Philippe? Is it because your pipeline will carve through the land that 100,000 people rely upon to live and grow food?8 Or maybe it’s because nearly a third of the pipeline will run through the basin of Lake Victoria, a source of fresh water for 40 million people,9 and your company is committed to the least expensive means of constructing it.10 An oil spill in the area would put millions of lives in danger, including those of the already-endangered animals living in the biodiversity hotspots along the route. Or maybe you are lying because the pipeline will emerge by a stretch of sea that is at risk of tsunamis.11 But don’t think about that, Philippe urges. Despite the many chilling environmental and humanitarian assessments of EACOP, he says many of these concerns are just “common misconceptions”. Think logically, the “entire 1,443-kilometer pipeline will be buried”, you won’t even see it after the bulldozers have gone! And here’s another comforting thought: TotalEnergies will bring jobs to Africa. “During the construction phase alone, it is forecasted that 18,000 direct and 60,000 indirect jobs will be created”. Yes, okay, Joseph Mawejje, a World Bank economist, says that after construction, such projects only retain 25% of the jobs initially created.12 However, that’s actually more than what Philippe himself predicts from EACOP, where he estimates just “900 direct jobs” will remain. Great news! And, on Philippe’s side, is the Ugandan government, ready to hold TotalEnergies to its commitment to “positive outcomes for biodiversity and communities”. The fact that 23% of Uganda’s budget is estimated to be lost to corruption every year is nothing to worry about, right?13 The frequent imprisoning of opposition politicians and human rights defenders by law enforcement are probably just blips in the normally well-functioning democracy the government upholds.14 None of this, sadly, is new. The cost of oil and, in particular, EACOP’s colonial oil, is clear for anyone who looks. Businessmen like Philippe know the repercussions of their work. They just don’t care enough to change course. And, until now, they’ve been able to rely on repressing local communities to minimise opposition. No longer. The unfolding crime Phillipe and his colleagues are committing is being resisted by young people who have had enough. To continue their work they will have to publicly walk over Students Against EACOP Uganda. The lies in Philippe’s condescending letter will be forced into the light of day by brave people standing between their communities and his bulldozers. Their resistance will show just how little he cares about human rights, peace, and the law. We can help Students Against EACOP Uganda stop this pipeline and deal another blow to those who are destroying everything we love. Financial support from ordinary people is the difference between keeping Students Against EACOP Uganda safe, effective and in the public eye. It is the difference between another victory for big oil on the frontlines of its war against humanity, or another step to safety for all of us. Please donate what you can afford to help Students Against EACOP mobilise and carry out their fourth wave of action. Read Philippe’s full letter below… References Follow us on social media.

"138","Just Stop Oil stages slow march through Leeds",2023-08-26,"Over 30 supporters of Just Stop Oil [1] staged a slow march in Leeds today, starting just after 11am from the Art Gallery.Those taking part in the march are demanding that the government heed the advice of the International Energy Agency, the United Nations and a majority of the UK public and cease granting licences for new oil and gas projects immediately. [2][3][4]Just Stop Oil is hosting online talks every Sunday at 5pm and most Tuesdays at 7pm (details at juststopoil.org) and invites all those who are concerned about Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves in the face of mounting evidence that the climate crisis is spinning out of control. [5]Greg Sculthorpe from Doncaster, who is attending the march today said:“This isn’t about hugging trees, this is about having enough food to feed your starving children, this is about keeping them safe when people are fighting for food. We need to resist new oil and gas while we still can.“We’ve had enough of this government’s lies. We all know that we cannot continue adding carbon into the atmosphere without consequence. The consequences are already unfolding around us. Panicking holiday makers in flip flops fleeing wildfires on Greek islands, floods and storms sweeping away houses and cars in China, India banning rice exports after heavy rains have decimated crops: nowhere is safe.”Another attendee from Leeds said:“Politics is broken, it seems incapable of getting us out of this mess. The government is literally risking our survival for short term profits while offering nothing but culture wars and divisive rhetoric against NHS workers and vulnerable refugees. We are all struggling to get by while oil and gas companies are making record profits and giving millions in illegal donations to the Conservative Party.“We all need to get on the streets and march together in solidarity. We have much more in common than the fossil fuelled media would have us believe. We are many and they are few and we will win, while this criminal government will be charged with crimes against humanity. It is only a matter of when. “At the end of July, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves while announcing 100 new oil and gas licences. Since then there has been near universal condemnation across parliament and civil society. Fifty MPs and peers, from all major parties, have written to the energy secretary to demand a rethink. Conservative MP and former Science Minister Chris Skidmore said that the decision was “wrong” while the rest of the world was experiencing record heatwaves and that history will not look favourably on it. He said he would ask the speaker for an emergency debate when parliament returns from its summer break. [6] [7]The civil service union, PCS, has said that “statements made by senior politicians which argue that increasing domestic fossil fuel extraction is compatible with the UK and global net zero commitments are not correct.” They suggest that if the Prime Minister was a civil servant he would stand in breach of the Civil Service Code as his announcement was not rooted in evidence and is in fact misleading. [8]A spokesperson from Just Stop Oil said:“The government plans to licence over 100 new oil and gas projects despite mounting evidence that this will impose unimaginable suffering and destroy the lives and livelihoods of billions of people.

"139","Exeter slow march rallies local opposition to new oil and gas licences",2023-08-19,"Just Stop Oil supporters slow-marched in Exeter city centre today, as they asked the public to join them in civil resistance to end new oil, gas and coal. Around 30 supporters marched for an hour, from Sidwell Street to Northernhay Gardens, talking to passers-by and handing out flyers to invite more of the public to join Just Stop Oil. Within 15 minutes, Devon and Cornwall Police ordered the marchers off the road, by issuing a section 12, Public Order Act notice. These powers are intended to prevent ‘serious disruption to the life of the community’, although the roads were quiet and buses could easily pass the slow march. Police then directed supporters onto the pavements and the march continued through the crowded Princesshay shopping centre. Gilly Robinson, 59,  a retired environmental educator from Dawlish who was on the march today said: “I was evacuated from my home in Dawlish twice during the storms of February 2014,The sea wall was breached and the railway line in front of my house left dangling. Climate change? Can’t prove it. But highly likely. People tell me to get my voice heard in a ‘more democratic’ way. All the while, the ice shelves melt, the seas continue to rise, wildfires creep ever closer – and nobody in power is doing a thing about it. Honestly?  I’m terrified. And this is why I slow-march.” Instead of acting to prevent climate change, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak plans to ‘max out’ the UK’s oil and gas reserves, including approving 100 new oil and gas licences. Just Stop Oil is asking people who are concerned to join us in fighting his criminal intentions and to support our demand  that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] Just Stop Oil is hosting a talk at the Exeter Phoenix at 6:30pm on Monday evening August 21st about how everyone can help make these demands. We invite all those who are concerned about these developments to attend, and sign up at: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/welcome-talk-how-to-just-stop-oil-exeter-tickets-699128822127 Maurice Spurway, a 69-year-old grandad from Exeter who joined the slow march today said: “We are on the brink of climate collapse, and the government still refuses to listen to the science. It’s ignoring its own advisors in maxing out on fossil fuels. Cheaper, safer and faster alternatives exist, and it seems that only civil disobedience will force the government to see sense. I don’t like disrupting people’s lives, but I don’t know what else I can effectively do.” Exeter is the home of the Met Office, which clearly explains that burning fossil fuels causes the CO2 emissions that are boiling our planet. [2] Extreme temperatures are driving more frequent adverse events, for example with July 2022’s UK heatwaves killing more people and widely damaging property. [3] During that period, there were over 3,000 excess deaths according to the UK’s Office for National Statistics. [4] Pumping up and burning yet more fossil fuels, wilfully causing more deaths and damage is criminal. The International Energy Agency, the United Nations and a majority of the UK public all want the government to cease granting licences for new oil and gas projects immediately.  [5][6][7]. Politicians, charities and ordinary people have spoken out against Sunak’s plans — but one group is leading the resistance: Just Stop Oil. Mathew, 36, from Exeter said: “Studying environmental science, I learned that the ecological and climate crisis we are facing is not a scientific or technical problem, but a political one.We have had the solutions for decades, but politicians have instead maintained the wealth and power of fossil fuel corporations and the billionaire-owned media. We now urgently need radical systemic change to have a hope of a sustainable future.” We will not let the status quo stand. We refuse to die quietly. Civil resistance is no longer an option, it is a necessity. Starting in late October, thousands of people will join Just Stop Oil in London to march on the roads, and we will not stop until we win.

"140","Dan Edelstyn’s evening with Just Stop Oil",2023-08-18,"Recently, we had the pleasure of hosting filmmaker Dan Edelstyn for a screening of his last documentary ‘Bank Job’. The film covers one couple’s efforts to challenge the unfairness that underlines the financial system, in part by selling their own banknotes and using the funds to purchase and forgive debt. Now, artist Hilary Powell and her husband Dan have been fundraising and organising in their community to outfit their whole street with solar panels, provididing free energy for the people and kickstarting a DIY green new deal. Their project, POWER, solutions embraces the solar punk idea of infrastructure as art and resistance – bringing a community together to both recognise and generate collective power. Dan wrote a touching and insightful blog about his experience, speaking about the theatre of civil resistance, the urgency of rapid transition to renewables, and everyone’s favourite JSO supporter Sam G. They are his own words and don’t necessarily reflect the official position of Just Stop Oil: My good friend Sam has joined Just Stop Oil. I interviewed him in my kitchen about a month or so ago with my colleague Leonie.. & following on from that he invited us to screen Bank Job to members of the group at their office near Dalston.. As filmmakers, we usually ask for a screening fee and an appearance fee for doing these types of events – and our collaborator / distributor Christo is very strict in this, as it’s so hard to make films, so we like to demonstrate the important principle of asking organisations to recognise the embedded labour (over years) in making these types of projects.. But on this occasion, I wanted to wave our fee and just go and chat with them – after all, when you look at the work of Just Stop Oil, you see ordinary people standing up courageously to the establishment, and not only putting their bodies in the way of a hostile state that seems hell-bent on self-destruction – but also putting their livelihoods at stake.. of course their work is “unpaid”. And in many cases, they’re being chucked into prison and can’t work – all that to try and halt new fossil projects.. There’s something about the clarity of their message which is so elegant and dynamic, it’s a campaign we truly admire. One of our friends recently referred to Just Stop Oil as “the only show in town”. I was aiming to get to the event around an hour after the film started, as I find it hard to watch Bank Job because I am very critical of it, and I just wanted to get to the bit where the lights went up and everyone asked the questions. The event had been started later than anticipated though, so I had to sit through quite a lot of the film, and the whole era came back to me with a sudden Proustian rush. This is the strange thing about filmmaking for me and Hilary- as we are in the films, watching them presents snapshots of our life with all the detail and emotion we felt at the time.. (one of the sharpest examples of this is seeing our children who looked so young) As we get older and the film becomes ever more remote, so will our relationship change with it.. just like if you see a snap of yourself as a child, and you wonder who that was.. But what I love about doing Q&A’s is the way in which the people in the room are seeing the film, reading the subject. And as the conversation began to flow, it became clear that Just Stop Oil wanted some help specifically with court debt, linked with injunctions.. Big private corporations / and our government or local councils get injunctions to stop them protesting on this road, or in this vicinity.. The injunctions are obtained by high-powered lawyers on eye-watering salaries – and all these costs are then passed on to those protestors who have been served with those injunctions.. So many of the people in the room had bills being sent to them in the multiple thousands.. Anyway we had a great discussion, lots of interesting questions – and then we began to chat about Power Station and many of the assembled audience were very interested in this project – some were from Fossil Free London who mainly target corporations which are greenwashing etc.. At the end I said to the room how much I respect and appreciate the courage it must take and all the costs of doing what they’re doing. My friend Sam said at the end of my short speech that “there was always a high vis for me, whenever I wanted it.” Then we went to the pub.. One of the first things Sam said was “you talked about the costs of all we’re doing in Just Stop Oil – but what you haven’t seemed to understand is the rewards of it. The camaraderie we feel when we take action, the freedom from fear we feel when we put on the high vis jackets, and cross that invisible line, and walk into the street.” Crossing the line.. One of the conversations that I remember most clearly was when Indi, one of founders of Just Stop Oil who was there – and really very bright and passionate person started to talk about their work in relation to theatre.. I think she was critiquing forms of radical street theatre as being a tactic that didn’t really work, removing itself from life to re-enact life on a stage.. And I began to see Just Stop Oil as a form of theatre. My friend Sam had spoken of this earlier – and he was right.. he was talking about the freedom that comes from taking action – becoming in a very real sense an “actor” – an active agent.. Here, he told me, things began to change – in the lives of those action-takers.. I had only seen the costs, the downside – but there was an upside, and for the conspirators around that table, the energy and excitement of their mission were palpable – and there was an excitement about it all. I could see all the actors in their uniforms / costumes – from the Police to the judges, to the photographers. All of them solemnly carrying out their roles according to the prescribed scripts of our times, or else like the politicians, rewriting the rules of the play. But this Just Stop Oil thing is a form of subversive theatre that brings the themes to life, through the crucible of human action – and I guess at the main cost to the actors themselves… Although – as Sam insisted – he has never felt more alive, and less in fear. His eyes are wide and luminous, I never saw him more thoroughly alive, more thoroughly liberated. It seems that the state can throw almost anything at Just Stop Oil – and they will appear again the next day – they describe it between themselves as a relay, one passing the batton of action to the next.. Some of them are in prison for longer periods – the ones who occupied the bridge for instance. Some are no doubt burned out but there seems to be no shortage of good people willing to take their place at the front lines. It was one of those glorious summer evenings, and though it had gotten quite late, and it was dark, the air remained alive with possibility and it seemed electric. Earlier that evening I’d talked to a local woman from the group, who had reminded me that early XR meetings had taken place in our Bank – and she sent her love to Hilary who wasn’t with me.. She said she used to work in IT but had had to stop a year or two ago, when she got too busy with XR.. My question was beginning to form: “how on earth do these people survive while doing the actions they do?” I didn’t want to put her on the spot and ask her directly though.. and strangely she was asking me the same question around Bank Job. How did we pull it off? There were so many people to chat to and I didn’t really respond properly to it – I didn’t have the time. These questions worried me about my friend Sam too – he’s a very talented graphic designer and although he had felt very worried about the climate before, he had never been much of a protestor until around maybe six months ago, when he “crossed the line”… now it seemed to me that Just Stop Oil was everything he did. He does have a family, presumably a mortgage too, a dog to walk.. but now into the mix, he’s managing a very busy “career” with Just Stop Oil – and has been arrested multiple times in the last few months. (I put the speech marks there because I presume everything he’s doing there is unpaid.” And that was the thing with Just Stop Oil – the commitment. They are doggedly pursuing a victory over the establishment and they are animated in this mission by a sense of time running out. And when you see the images of Greece, Spain and Italy on the TV -and when you look in the garden and wonder where all the bugs are.. you can’t help but agree.. they are right.. Sam passed me a high-vis jacket across the table – and I felt in a sense the whole conversation – or at least one part of it through the night, was him asking me why I haven’t yet donned the high vis and whether or not I too will cross the line. And there’s a part of me that’s there with them – I can see the clarity of their demands, the beauty and power of their theatre – the simple orange high-vis costume; the high-stakes, conflict-driven story-telling that has propelled them into the mainstream imagination, and got their message out far and wide.. And the fact is that they have visibility – ministers are responding to them!  I looked across the table as Indi was saying “We have to up the tension” – and I began to see her as a genius political playwright. As the tensions escalate so does the excitement. The knuckles drain of their colour.. She was clearly thrilled to be effectively in direct conversation with Grant Shapps who is writing about them, trying to get Starmer to cough up the damages on the Department of Energy’s building.. although Schapps isn’t writing to them, they are on his radar, they are on his mind – and their demands are all over the tabloids.. They are as my friend writes “the only show in town”. And their counterparts in Europe have been declared terrorist organisations..  But as Indy says – they may have their accounts frozen and be labelled as terrorists, but the next day fresh donations will pile in totalling three times what they had in their account the day before. Ultimately I came away from the evening with the Just Stop Oil High Vis stuffed in my pocket, a moment of possibility for sure, but probably for me, it’s a mantel that will remain as a costume in a drawer, not one I will be putting on. That’s not to say there’s any less respect for them – it’s just that I’m dedicated full time to Power Station – and I have a small team that I’m also dedicated to.. and if I were to start, then where would I stop? And the solution we are working for is harmonious with the goals of Just Stop Oil. We are saying : Just Start Power Stations – let’s do it street by street – everywhere, at speed And this struggle we’re in also has power. And perhaps we need to remind ourselves that we all have unique strengths, unique capacities and unique roles to play – and that there will never be only one way to contribute to this movement. Our next step is to figure out which streets to work with – we have so far had 31 people fill out our form, and we are fascinated by the streets we’re looking at. Everywhere from London to Bristol to Wales to Orkney! Before we start to raise the pot to help fund these streets, we will need to decide a shortlist to come and visit and make short films of each – and this will be the thing we need to do next. But for now the children are off school, and it seems a very difficult time to launch a new fundraiser – we need a bit of a break and to be there as parents for them. This too is important. This too needs time. If you want to join in our street-by-street expansion – please visit this form and fill it out as the first step!

"141","100 new crimes against humanity",2023-07-31,"Rishi Sunak and his fossil fuel backers are taking us all for fools. Most people in this country know that oil is over. They know that carbon capture is greenwash. Only Sunak and the Tories have failed to get the message. Addicted to power and illegal donations from the fossil fuel industry they are shamelessly stoking culture wars and spinning endless lies to keep themselves in power. But it is much, much worse than that. July was the hottest month ever because of burning fossil fuels. We can all see that something is desperately wrong when tens of thousands of panicking holidaymakers rush to Rhodes beaches to escape wildfires, Americans have suffered second degree burns from scorching pavements and European wheat crops are burning to a crisp. Every new oil and gas license makes it harder for the world to reach net-zero emissions and to stop global heating. Every delay in stopping global heating means worse climate impacts and more suffering. Sunak is worse than a war criminal. He knows new oil and gas will impose unimaginable suffering and destroy the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. He knows that it will push the world past irreversible tipping points, meaning that the consequences and suffering will echo for centuries. He is risking nothing less than the collapse of human civilization. What will his obvious lies about “energy security” mean, when you can’t grow food, when violence stalks the streets, when everything you know and love is destroyed? Licensing new oil and gas, in full knowledge of these consequences, isn’t just a crime against humanity. It is the greatest crime in human history. We will not let this stand. We refuse to die quietly. Civil resistance is no longer an option, it is a necessity. In late October, thousands of people will join Just Stop Oil in London to march on the roads, and we will not stop until we win.

"142","“We’re on course for collapse!’- Just Stop Oil disrupt the Open",2023-07-21,"Three Just Stop Oil Supporters have disrupted the The British Open. They are demanding the UK government halt all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects. [1] At around 12:20pm, three Just Stop Oil supporters ran onto hole seventeen at the The Open in Royal Liverpool. They set off a smoke flare and threw orange powder paint on the green, before being removed by security. One of those taking action today is Hailey Birch, 19, a university student from Leicestershire. She said: “We’re on course for collapse! This week we have witnessed some of the dire consequences of our addiction to fossil fuels, with extreme heat warnings issued over three continents, putting countless people at risk of illness and death.” “Yet the government is still granting new oil and gas licences. How many more children fleeing wildfires do we need to see before we do something? This is not the world I want to live in and I will not be complicit in allowing this government to carry on with their genocidal policies. For all we love, we must Just Stop Oil”. Another of those taking action today is Noah Crane, 18, a community coordinator from Buxton, he said: “I’m disrupting the open today, not because I want to, but as a young person, I feel I have no other choice. This government is knowingly taking action that will kill hundreds of millions of people and destroy my future. They have made it clear that they value the profits of the few over the lives of the many. So now we must make it clear that we will not stand for that; that we will not roll over and allow them to sell our lives to line their pockets.” “Climate scientists are telling us the development of new oil, gas and coal projects will be beyond disastrous for humanity. This is not a situation where we can just sit back and hope someone else sorts it out for us; the stakes are too high.” Today’s action comes as scientists warn that successive heatwaves threaten nature’s ability to provide us with food. “Our food system is global,” said John Marsham, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Leeds. “There are growing risks of simultaneous major crop losses in different regions in the world, which will really affect food availability and prices. This is not what we’re seeing right now, but in the coming decades that’s one of the things I’m really scared of.” The 2018 European heatwave led to multiple crop failures and loss of yield of up to 50% in central and northern Europe. Heatwaves are expected to become 12 times more frequent by 2040 compared with pre-warming levels. Marsham said: “People are generally isolated from the effects of the weather on which we all depend. We go to shops to buy food – we don’t grow it ourselves. But if you talk to farmers anywhere in the world, they are extremely aware of what the weather is doing, and the impacts on their farming.” [2] Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,350 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. There are currently three Just Stop Oil supporters imprisoned for demanding an end to new oil, gas and coal. It’s time to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance to end new oil, gas and coal. We are inviting everyone to come and march with us every day in London from the 16th-22nd July.

"143","Just Stop Oil marches as UK’s leading climate scientist offers dire warning",2023-07-21,"Just Stop Oil supporters are approaching the end of week thirteen of their campaign of daily marching to demand an end to new oil, gas and coal in the UK. [1] 170 supporters in 16 groups set off at around 8am to march in Hammersmith, Redbridge, Kings Cross, Victoria, Whitechapel, Farringdon, and Earls Court. This morning Animal Rising will be joining in solidarity, slow-marching from Smithfield Meat Market, whilst LGBTQ+ supporters of Just Stop Oil are marching through Westminster. There have been numerous incidents of members of the public shoving supporters out of the road today, with several marchers knocked to the ground, including a visually impaired woman and a young student. Matt Black, founder of Ninja Tune Records and producer of 90’s hit ‘The Only Way Is Up’, has been arrested in Parliament Square for marching with Just Stop Oil this morning. He said: “I’ve been arrested today whilst standing against our government’s unbelievably corrupt and idiotic mishandling of the climate emergency. Just Stop Oil is ringing the fire alarm because oil and gas are burning down our home. Every day on the news, more extreme heat, floods are raging, and people are suffering and dying. And this is coming to the UK, trust me.” “When you ring the alarm it wakes people up and it’s a horrible racket, so they might get pissed off. But when you see the house is on fire, the alarm stops. We can worry about putting the flames out. First step, stop the guys chucking petrol on the house- the oil companies. And then get off our addiction to burning their products. Renewables already won the argument, being far cheaper and safer. But oil companies are doing everything to keep us addicted. They lie, they cheat, they murder and they bribe our government to protect them.” Another of those marching this morning, Tom Williams, 33, a scientist from Cambridge, said: “Climate collapse is here, now, you just have to look at the front page of the news. That means every fraction of a degree of warming matters, every tonne of carbon is more deaths and lives ruined. Our government knows that. Every day we see new and terrifying headlines, giving us a glimpse of the unliveable future they are pushing us towards.” “Our governments’ policy is killing people so they can line their own pockets. We need a government that moves past this corruption and greed and instead invests the money they pour into new oil and gas into clean energy, cheap public transport and all the other infrastructure we so badly need. Anyone can stand up, and if enough of us do, we can protect ourselves and others.” This morning’s marches come on the back of comments from Professor Sir Bob Watson who said: “I do not believe we will achieve the 1.5C limit; in fact, I’m very pessimistic about achieving even 2C, and that if we allow the target to become looser and looser, higher and higher, governments will do even less in the future.” Watson is currently Emeritus Professor of the UK’s Tyndall Centre for Climate Research. He previously worked at the UN, Nasa, UK’s Department of Environment and the US White House – and is perhaps one of the foremost climate scientists in the world. His comments, although candid, were supported by Lord Stern, Chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. The International Panel on Climate Change has said keeping temperature rises below 1.5C, rather than 2C, would mean 10 million fewer people would lose their homes to rising sea levels.

"144","Just Stop Oil marchers kettled by counter-protestors as scientists warn ‘we are damned fools’ for not acting on crisis",2023-07-20,"Just Stop Oil supporters are disrupting roads in central London during their thirteenth week of continuous resistance against new oil, gas and coal. [1] Throughout the morning, starting from 9am, 132 supporters began marching in nine groups around West, East London and South London. This morning’s marches have been eventful. On Cromwell Road, a coach was seen driving into the march, whilst in Elephant and Castle, a march was kettled by a group of counter-protestors wearing t-shirts emblazoned with ‘Just Stop Pissing Everyone Off’. Polite discourse about the necessity for culturally disruptive action ensued, as the Just Stop Oil supporters sat and gave personal testimonies whilst encircled. One Just Stop Oil supporter addressed the counter-protestors, who applauded her as she spoke: “I’d like to see how long you are willing to stand there, because this is great for us, we’re having conversations and I think it’s been so beneficial this morning being able to meet with some of you lovely people and have these conversations with you, and for us to find out why we’re here and why you’re here, because believe me we are the ordinary people and we have the power. The only thing that needs to happen now is we need to connect the dots and join together.” After some discussion the anti-Just Stop Oil protestors left cordially, and the march proceeded on the road. A further ten marches are currently under way from 11am. Yesterday, 55 people were arrested, many unlawfully after stepping in the road for a few seconds. This morning, a Just Stop Oil supporter was arrested after his house was raided by the Metropolitan Police. Daniel Knorr, the marcher who was assaulted by a motorist yesterday, is reportedly feeling well but at the encouragement of others sought treatment at A&E for a potential concussion. In interviews he asserted that he wasn’t interested in pressing charges to the individual involved, but would rather see climate criminal oil executives and politicians prosecuted. One of those on the road this morning, Jonathan Kennedy, 44, an Engineer and Parent of two young children, from Brighton, said: “I’m marching today with Just Stop Oil to demand that the government stops all new oil and gas licensing. We are on track for devastating climate chaos, food scarcity, water scarcity, hundreds of millions of climate refugees- leading to conflict and war. It’s already happening. As a parent, I can’t sit by and watch as the government actively makes the situation worse by issuing more oil, gas and coal licences. This is the complete opposite of what we need to do.” “When my children ask me what I was doing when there was still a chance to prevent the worst effects of climate breakdown. I will say I tried everything I could. Rishi Sunak and Grant Schnapps, what will you say to your children when they ask you the same question? You have the power to stop all new oil and gas licences. For the sake of your children and their generation, make the right choice. Be on the right side of history, be able to look at your children and say, ‘I did what I could’.” Another of those marching, Rajan Naidu, 72, from Birmingham, said: “Yesterday I was arrested. I do not like to be arrested, but if getting arrested is the only way that ordinary citizens, like us, can get our voices of desperation heard, as we sound the alarm for urgent action to be taken, then so be it.” “Rishi Sunak and his government act like science-deniers even though they have access to the very latest climate science. The very real climate crisis that has been devastating India and Pakistan- sabotaging their ability to feed themselves, does not seem to affect our government, or stimulate them to take decisive, effective action to keep us safe. Either we end the fossil fuel era or the fossil fuel era will end us.” Today, Eddie Whittingham will be facing a plea hearing for his action taken on Monday 17th July, which saw him spray orange paint at the University of Exeter graduation ceremony. He was tackled by university security and handed over to the police, and has been kept on remand since then. This student being imprisoned for nonviolent actions demonstrates the university’s unwillingness to tolerate criticism of their collaboration with climate criminals. Many academics and students have already spoken up in support of Eddie’s actions, calling on the university to end their greenwashing programme with Shell Oil. Yesterday, James Hansen, the US scientist who alerted the world to the greenhouse effect in the 1980s said “we are damned fools” for not acting upon warnings over the climate crisis. Hansen, whose testimony to the US Senate in 1988 is cited as the first high-profile revelation of global heating, warned in a statement with two other scientists that the world was moving towards a “new climate frontier” with temperatures higher than at any point over the past million years, bringing severe impacts such as stronger storms, heatwaves and droughts, which will lead to millions unable to eat and forced to flee their homes.

"145","Climate criminal think tank Policy Exchange painted by Just Stop Oil",2023-07-20,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted the headquarters of Policy Exchange, a conservative think-tank in Westminster. They are demanding that the UK government immediately halt all new licences and consents for new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] The pair threw 5l of orange paint before daubing the building with their bare hands. Policy Exchange is an ExxonMobil-funded think-tank that has a strong influence over the policies of Rishi Sunak’s government – which is responsible for criminalising protest, licensing fossil fuel extraction, and failing to create a transition to safe energy. Rishi Sunak worked at Policy Exchange before becoming an MP, and it had a major part in funding his campaign. [2] Observing the action at the Policy Exchange this morning was acclaimed naturalist and ‘Springwatch’ presenter Chris Packham, who is filming a documentary on nonviolent direct action. One of those taking action today was Ph.D. student Sean Irving, 24. He said: “Policy Exchange has been named the most powerful think-tank in the United Kingdom, yet hardly anyone has heard of them. Rishi Sunak has proudly claimed that they are behind both recent authoritarian policies that have cracked down on protest in the UK and the small boats rhetoric that has demonised refugees seeking refuge in the United Kingdom.” “The giant hypocrisy is that the new oil and gas projects that the government has in the pipeline will cause migration like we’ve never seen before. I’m taking action with Just Stop Oil today to call on the UK government to listen to the United Nations, the International Energy Agency and thousands of scientists over an opaque think-tank funded by fossil fuel money. We must do better.” Policy Exchange was founded by Michael Gove and others in 2007, and since that time has raised millions of pounds in funding from shadowy groups such as the US-based ‘National Philanthropic Trust’, an infamous vehicle for corporate and oil interests wishing to channel funds into right-wing projects. Key supporters of Sunak’s campaign to become the unelected PM were also Policy Exchange funders either individually or through family foundations. [3] [4] Speaking at Policy Exchange’s summer party on 28th June, Sunak boasted that the think-tank’s work “helped us draft” the government’s crackdown on protests. After receiving an infusion of cash from ExxonMobil in 2017, the institution published a report entitled ‘Extremism Rebellion’, calling for the police and the government to clamp down on climate protests. Sunak’s comments give weight to the allegations that this report shaped the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act which came into power in 2022. This draconian bill has massively extended the criminalisation of protest – granting the police new powers to decide what constitutes a ‘disruptive’ protest and to more harshly punish nonviolent protesters. [5] [6] Another taking action today was Ella Ward, 20, an Environmental Science student from Birmingham. They said: “I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I’m not going to stand by while my government continues with its genocidal and murderous plans to licence new coal, oil and gas. I’m 20 years old and I have so much to live for. Young people are being failed by the British government, and on behalf of young people globally, we deserve better. I am fed up of screaming into the void and being ignored whilst profit is prioritised over life. How many more people need to needlessly die before our government takes action?” “We have painted the Policy Exchange because they have been instrumental in implementing laws to restrict climate protesters. The prime minister praised Policy Exchange for their draconian and anti-democratic lobbying. They criminalise peaceful protesters for exercising their right to march for a liveable future. Meanwhile, the criminals in Parliament and in board rooms are getting away with murder.” Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,300 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Currently there are three Just Stop Oil supporters imprisoned for resisting new oil, gas and coal. It’s time to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance to end new oil, gas and coal.

"146","Open letter from Just Stop Oil to all those complicit in genocide: Your time is up",2023-07-19,"Tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of people will die in the current heat storms. Any government that refuses to put it’s country on a war footing that sees emissions slashed and an urgent programme of adaptation introduced is criminally negligent” – Prof Bill McGuire, 17 July 2023 “We are heading towards 3 to 4°C of warming across this century, an absolute climate catastrophe for all species including our own. And all we are doing so far is giving rhetoric and optimism and greenwash.” – Professor Kevin Anderson, 8 June 2023 “I thought fossil fuel firms could change. I was wrong.” – Christiana Figueres, 6 July 2023 The facts are clear. New oil and gas licensing in 2023 will kill hundreds of millions of people, adding to the already mounting global death toll from climate breakdown. It will push our climate, oceans and the living world beyond the point of no return, triggering runaway global heating and setting in motion an unstoppable process of global societal collapse. To know these facts and still encourage drilling for UK new oil and gas is reckless and immoral. There can be no greater crime. Since the declaration of a climate and environmental emergency by the British Parliament, in 2019, it has become obvious that our politicians and corporations have no intention of acting in accordance with the fundamental interests of either our young people or the country as a whole. Whether those in charge realise that they are engaging in genocide, is not the question. For this is how it will be seen by the next generation and all future generations. Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi, at his trial in Jerusalem, sought to defend himself by saying that he never killed any Jews as he was only in charge of transporting them to the death camps. The judges overruled this obscene defence and he was hanged. Similarly, when those in charge today go to court in the coming years, they will claim that they only facilitated the continued use of fossil fuels. They never actually killed the starving poor of Sudan and Pakistan. And likewise the judgement will be the same – you knew what you were doing and you did not stop it. Justice will be done. To this end, from this moment forward, Just Stop Oil, working closely with lawyers, will publicly gather evidence against fossil fuel executives, bankers, ministers and officials and members of the legal and media professions who order, administrate or facilitate the exploitation of new oil and gas resources or who conspire to prosecute those taking action to prevent the greatest act of mass murder in human history. We say to all these people, consider carefully your responsibilities to yourself, your family and the country. This is not a game. This is not a campaign for one small policy change. It is not just another protest. It is resistance against evil. Face facts before it is too late.

"147","Just Stop Oil marcher assaulted as wildfires rage across the globe",2023-07-19,"Just Stop Oil supporters are disrupting roads in central London during their thirteenth week of continuous resistance against new oil, gas and coal. [1] Throughout the morning, starting from 8am, around 160 supporters in 24 groups have been marching on key roads in London. They caused disruption in Victoria, Vauxhall, Charing Cross, Marylebone, Holborn, Bow, and Westminster. The marches elicited a range of reactions from the public, with support from well wishers as well as hostility from some pedestrians and drivers. At 8:20am, on the opposite side of Cromwell Road to the march, a driver crashed their Mercedes into another vehicle. The driver of the Mercedes then proceeded to cross the road to assault one of the Just Stop Oil supporters, throwing him to the ground and punching and kicking him in the head. Speaking after he was assaulted, Daniel Knorr, 21, a student from Oxford, who gained notoriety after being carried off the pitch at Lords by Johnny Bairstow, said: “I haven’t said anything to the police and I don’t plan to, but I’m afraid that the police might go after this man. I feel no ill sentiment or ill will against him. It’s a difficult situation for anyone to be in and it’s bound to create frustration. I can tell with the fact that he’d just been in a car accident, he was very stressed. Really, if the police spent more time going after the people at the top who got us in this mess- the people in government and at the top of these fossil fuel companies who are destroying the lives of future generations, as well as the media moguls who create this toxic media space, to keep us divided; instead of going after people like this man, I’d be much happier. Then marching in the road wouldn’t even be necessary.” At 9am the leader of Reform UK, Talk TV host and science-denier, Richard Tice, was seen arguing with police on Vauxhall Bridge. Starting at 10:35am, four groups of supporters began slow marching around Parliament Square, with up to 60 people in each march starting in 15-minute intervals. Police quickly issued Section 12 orders to each march as they started, and immediately proceeded with illegal arrests. At least 35 were arrested. Mitch Rose, 57 a mother of two from Derbyshire, said: “Let’s be very clear, this is a catastrophe of unimaginable human suffering, unfolding right now. What we’re seeing across Europe, the USA and Asia is just the start. And there are people in power who are guilty of crimes against humanity for their failure to act to protect the citizens of their country. The UK government, namely Rishi Sunak and Grant Shapps, know that by continuing to subsidise and support new oil and gas, they are causing the deaths of millions.” “My family in Barbados are on the front line, as water levels rise and small island nations disappear. It breaks my heart that my family will face catastrophic storms and hurricanes and destruction of their homes, livelihoods and perhaps even lose their lives. Or they could end up as climate refugees… and we know how that ends for people with dark coloured skin.” At the same time as the marches this morning, skyrocketing temperatures have been triggering natural disasters internationally. Wildfires in Greece are said to be causing widespread panic and destruction, while key cotton crops in China are at risk of failing due to unseasonal heat. Health warnings have been issued across Europe and the United States, and in Canada a child has died from effects of the wildfire smoke that is polluting the country. [2] [3] [4] The Daily Mirror described the devastating heatwave in southern Europe as the “terrifying reality of today’s climate crisis”. Temperatures in Greece are expected to exceed a record-breaking high of 43 degrees on Sunday – the same record that was set in Rome yesterday. [5] [6] George Simonson, 23, a Mechanical Engineering Graduate from London said: “Having studied engineering, I know that we already have all the technological solutions needed to transition away from oil and gas. We just lack the political will. That’s why I’m marching today. If we don’t step up, the government will continue licensing more fossil fuel extraction, sending millions to a painful death via drought, famine and slaughter.” “We have to challenge this, that’s why I’m on the road today. We have a responsibility to resist as this government continues with its genocidal policies. Just Stop Oil will be taking the action to University campuses from October, because our institutions are absolutely complicit in this genocide. I’m asking all young people in the UK to step up because new oil and gas is a death sentence for those on the front lines of the climate crisis in places like Uganda, Tanzania, Bangladesh and Pakistan.” Just Stop Oil will be making an announcement in Parliament Square at 11am this morning. Today at 7:30am supporters of the group spray-painted the department responsible for licensing over 100 new licences for oil gas and coal exploration in the UK- the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. The supporters used a fire extinguisher to cover the department’s headquarters in orange paint. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Just Stop Oil supporters Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker are serving three-year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal in the longest sentences for peaceful climate action in British history. It’s time to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance to end new oil, gas and coal. We are inviting everyone to come and march with us every day in London from the 16th-23rd July.

"148","Just Stop Oil paint the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero",2023-07-19,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. They are demanding that the UK government immediately halt all new licences and consents for new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] At 7:30am two Just Stop Oil supporters spray-painted the department responsible for licensing over 100 new licences for oil gas and coal exploration in the UK, with orange paint from a fire extinguisher, then sat down to await arrest. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “The people in this department are making decisions that will bring about the wholesale destruction of human civilisation. They are threatening the lives of all of us. The young people of today will look back in horror at the crimes of this government and will demand justice. In signing-off new oil, gas and coal projects, this department signs the death warrants of hundreds of millions of people. In the climate trials of the future, they will be held to account for the crime of genocide, it is not a matter of ‘if’, but ‘when’.” One of those taking action this morning, Matthew Cunningham, 25, a food producer from Suffolk, said: “I want to see a world in which there is good food for everyone, this is why I love my work. But if this government continues to ignore the facts, and forces through new oil and gas developments, then no matter how hard I work I will never get to see this future.” “We know that putting more carbon in the atmosphere is causing crop failures and threatening the fragile global food system. The UK is not immune, every grower we know has been troubled by drought this summer. I will not let famine be part of the future of my newborn nephew. I will not give up.” Another of those taking action, Imogen May, 24, from Suffolk, who also works in food production, said: “I’m taking action with Just Stop Oil because I feel like we’re living in a sort of dystopian nightmare. Three continents are under severe heat alerts right now. A billion people could be forced out of the conditions suitable for supporting human life by 2030. An area the size of Portugal has burned down in Canada. Yet our government’s response to that is to make the problem many times worse by licensing new oil, gas and coal?.. It’s total madness!” Today, Just Stop Oil will be making an announcement in Parliament Square at 11am. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,300 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Currently there are three Just Stop Oil supporters imprisoned for resisting new oil, gas and coal. It’s time to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance to end new oil, gas and coal.

"149","Over 30 Just Stop Oil Marches as leaked documents reveal climate failures",2023-07-18,"Just Stop Oil supporters are continuing to disrupt roads in central London during their thirteenth week of continuous resistance against new oil, gas and coal. [1] At 8am around 180 supporters in 15 groups marched on key roads across North, South and West London. Some members of the public were seen expressing support, whilst others allowed their frustration to get the better of them. Some people threw drinks at the marchers, a moped rider and a car driver steered their vehicles into people on the road and others shoved Just Stop Oil supporters out of the street. Police arrested several Just Stop Oil supporters including one at Hangar Lane at  8:20 and one at Elephant and Castle at 8:24. Two further arrests occurred on Borough High Street at 10:35. Starting from 10am, 15 more marches left causing further disruption. One pedestrian attacked marchers with a skateboard. One of this morning’s marches is made up of a group of scientists. One of those on the road is Dr Susi Arnott, 65, a research biologist from London. She said: “The science is in; fossil fuel use is killing our life support systems – but none of the people in power are taking climate breakdown seriously. Even the fossil fuel companies’ own research from decades ago is being ignored, as if you can stop it being true by hiding it in a drawer. I want them to stop lying to the public. I’ve tried teaching and writing about the crisis – I’ve asked my elected representatives to take climate collapse seriously.” “So marching is a last gasp for me – but actually it feels more like taking a deep breath, to be standing up with fellow scientists, not sitting on the sidelines studying disaster as it unfolds. I’m a biologist because I’m entranced by life on Earth – by other species and how we all knit together. We’ve let global heating run on for so long that radical change is inevitable, one way or another. If we act now, human civilisation and the biosphere it depends on can survive this, but ‘business as usual’ is taking us all to hell.” Another scientist marching today, Dr Tristram Wyatt, 66, Emeritus Fellow, Kellogg College, University of Oxford, said: “I study animal behaviour, across the animal kingdom. So many species are going extinct, even as we study them. They are victims of the climate catastrophe, driven by burning fossil fuels.” “The science is clear: we can have no new fossil fuel projects. We must just stop new oil, not give 100 more licences as this government is doing, against the advice of its own scientists and its own pledges.” “There’s an unprecedented heatwave all over southern Europe, including places like Spain that export fruit and veg to us. The heatwave is killing the crops we all depend on. Food prices will rise.” The marches today come as the government’s plan to cope with the climate crisis is being condemned as “very weak” by experts, who say not enough is being done to protect lives and livelihoods. The world is currently experiencing searing temperatures across three continents, however experts have highlighted the government’s failure to adequately protect people in the UK from extreme heat. The heatwave in 2022, when temperatures surpassed 40C for the first time, led to the early deaths of more than 3,000 people, wildfires, buckled rail lines and farmers struggling with drought. In March the government’s own Climate Change Committee described the government as “strikingly unprepared.” “The new plan falls far short of being a strategy that will ensure the protection of lives and livelihoods against more frequent and intense floods, droughts and heatwaves,” said Bob Ward, policy director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. [2][3][4] Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial.

"150","Student paints University of Exeter during graduation ceremony",2023-07-17,"A Just Stop Oil supporter has disrupted his graduation ceremony at the University of Exeter as a call for students to take action against the UK Government’s plans to licence new oil and gas projects. [1] At 1:15pm, Eddie Whittingham, 25, was tackled by security as he sprayed a university courtyard orange with a paint-loaded fire extinguisher, while his graduating cohort looked on. Shortly beforehand he had received his BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. He was arrested at the scene. Eddie is known for high-profile Just Stop Oil actions, including the interruption of the World Snooker Championship in April 2023, where he climbed a snooker table at The Crucible Theatre and released orange-coloured powder. Speaking before his action today, he said: “My name’s Eddie, I’m 25 years old and I’m about to disrupt my own graduation ceremony. Exactly 3 months ago, I disrupted the snooker world championship. I’m taking these actions because our government has failed young people like me.” “They have failed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with science. They have failed to prepare us for the inevitable disruption that they have caused. They’re driving our society towards collapse by continuing to allow new oil, gas and coal. This is a violation of the advice of the International Energy Agency, the United Nations and thousands and thousands of climate scientists all around the world, who have been warning us for years: new fossil fuels means death.” “As a result, 1 billion people may be displaced from their homes by 2030. That’s 7 years away. We face a future of mass-starvation and unimaginable suffering, including here in the UK. And all of this is happening so a small handful of extremely rich people can carry on getting even richer.” “Universities, rather than preparing young people for this inevitable disruption, are instead upholding a status quo that is going to kill millions, if not billions of people. That’s why I’m calling on students everywhere to join us in resistance against this criminal government.” “What use is a university degree if you can’t feed yourself? What use is an “education” if society is collapsing around you? Each one of us has a choice: die quietly or get into resistance. It’s now or never.” Also arrested was Kostja Junglas, 27, a PhD student at Oxford University. They were tackled by University of Exeter security for attempting to hold up a banner to the crowd of graduates. In 2022, the University of Exeter began a new partnership with Shell Oil, building on decades of collaboration between the university and the company. The stated aim of the project is ‘Carbon Sequestration’, a speculative technology that would allow Shell to continue producing fossil fuels whilst reducing their carbon emissions. However, experts that don’t stand to gain from Shell profits have declared carbon sequestration unviable: “Many international bodies and national government are relying on carbon capture in the fossil fuel sector to get to net zero, and it simply won’t work,” according to Bruce Robertson, the author of an Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis report on the topic. Students are campaigning for the university to cut ties with Shell under the name ‘Shell Out’. [2] [3] The first week of July 2023 is believed to have been the hottest in the history of humanity, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. The highest temperature in recorded history has been set repeatedly in the last few weeks, and this pattern is expected to continue. “We are in uncharted territory and we can expect more records to fall as El Niño develops further and these impacts will extend into 2024,” said Christopher Hewitt, World Meteorological Organisation director of climate services, adding “This is worrying news.”  The impacts of this climate crisis are already devastating, and will only multiply in the short term.

Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance against new oil, gas and coal. The time is now. Join us and slow march while you still can.

"151","Twenty one Just Stop Oil supporters arrested for marching as thirteenth week of disruption begins",2023-07-17,"Just Stop Oil are commencing their thirteenth week of marching. They are demanding that the UK government halt any new licensing or consents for oil, gas and coal extraction in the UK. [1] In an escalation of resistance from previous weeks, at 8am this morning around 180 Just Stop Oil supporters, in fourteen groups, began marching on key roads in central London. They marched in groups of between 5 and 25 supporters, carrying placards reading “new oil = murder”, “ hottest June ever” and “can’t eat oil”. Police followed numerous groups before marches began and stopped and searched dozens of people. Police began issuing Public Order Act (Section 12) notices at 8:10am, just minutes after the first march set off. Three Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested after 15 minutes of marching on Liverpool Street. Around twenty Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested as they attempted to leave Lambeth bridge, however 11 of these were de-arrested. The team in Victoria was removed by 8:35. Police were seen following marchers on the tube at 9:00am. Another two were arrested on Liverpool Street at 9:45. At 10:30 two were arrested on Victoria Street. Further marches are ongoing. Frances Davis, 20, from Norwich spoke to the camera as she was held in handcuffs: “I’ve been marching for just under 15 minutes and I’m under arrest for demanding the same thing as the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the United Nations and the government’s own scientific advisors have been demanding- and we’ve just been ignored. We’ve tried everything else and now I’m in handcuffs, just for going on a march.” One of those on the road this morning Louis Pilfold 32, an Engineer from Camden, said: “I’m marching because our children deserve lives as good as ours have been. They have done nothing to deserve the hardship of climate breakdown. It’s important that we engage with the reality of our predicament- that continued dumping of carbon into the atmosphere has put us in the midst of a human-made extinction event. Scientists are warning that irreversible tipping points have already been triggered.” “We have to face up to the fact that the quickly destabilising climate will result in chaos- as we are starting to see. We also have to realise our leaders have zero intention of resolving this crisis, due to criminal corruption amongst other factors. Our children need us to move quickly from despair into action, that is why I’m marching and you should be too.” Another of those marching today, Anne Taylor, a retired teacher from Oxford said: “I am an ordinary 74 year old grandmother to four amazing children, the youngest just 2 months old. Their future is so very bleak it just terrifies me to think about it. So I simply have to do whatever I can. That’s why I am marching today with Just Stop Oil. I hate to disrupt other people’s lives. But life simply cannot continue as usual. We are sounding the alarm. This is an emergency. It’s happening right now.” “As a 74 year old retired teacher I’d rather be working on my allotment or in my garden. But I have to be here marching on the streets – because we are in a climate crisis- described by the Secretary General of the United Nations as ‘out of control’. I have four grandchildren. I am terrified for their future.” This morning’s marches come as extreme heat continues to ravage Europe and now 110 million people have been issued extreme heat warnings in the US, as a heat dome over the US south-west has translated into coast to coast alerts. Temperature records could be broken in as many as 38 cities. In Las Vegas security guards can be seen guarding the fountains of upscale casinos and hotels to prevent people from jumping in, whilst mobile clinics are reporting treating homeless people suffering from third-degree burns. A heat dome occurs when an area of high pressure pushes air towards the ground, compressing it and causing it to heat. The warmer air then rises again, setting up a cycle in which air sinks through the centre of the ‘dome’ and rises up its sides. The pressure also prevents other weather systems that would cool the area – such as rain clouds – from forming.

"152","Breaking: Dozens more people risk prison for literally upholding the law",2023-07-17,"On Monday 17 July, a group of approximately 20 people will risk prison by holding signs outside Isleworth Crown Court. Their signs communicate the centuries-old right of all jurors in British courtrooms to acquit a defendant according to their conscience and irrespective of the directions of the judge.The show of resistance from the group (which includes Quakers, doctors, athletes, professors and a former government lawyer) comes amid mounting concern that jury trials for peaceful people holding the government to account through acts of nonviolent civil resistance are being turned into show trials, after a succession of jury acquittals have embarrassed ministers and politicians. Among others, in April 2021 a  jury acquitted 6 of Shell 7. In January 2022 a jury acquitted the Colston 4, who toppled a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston into Bristol Harbour. In November 2022 a jury acquitted members of Palestine Action for targeting the arms manufacturer, Elbit, which makes drones used to kill Palestinians. In January 2023 a jury acquitted Insulate Britain campaigners after an M4 roadblock. In February 2023 a jury acquitted Burning Pink campaigners who had splashed pink paint over Conservative,  Labour and Green Party HQs. In June 23 a jury acquitted the Brook House 3, who disrupted deportations to Jamaica, after the defendants shared it was their duty to resist violent and racist Government policies. [1][2][3][4][5][6] Given the importance of trial by jury to the British public, which is the British Justice system’s primary safeguard against the abuse of state power, it would be politically impossible for the Government to abolish it. Instead measures have been taken by Judges and lawmakers to render the role of jurors substantially meaningless, while preserving the appearance of jury trial, such as: The principle that juries can acquit a defendant as a matter of conscience has been enshrined in British Law since 1670. When sheep stealing was punishable with execution, juries refused to convict ordinary people, compelling a change in the law. When Clive Ponting exposed the Government’s lies about the sinking of the General Belgrano in 1982, at the cost of 323 lives, the jury acquitted him of breach of the Official Secrets Act, despite the judge’s direction that he had no defence. The principle, often referred to as jury nullification, is taught to our children in schools and is literally set in marble on display in the original entrance to the Old Bailey. [10][11] The people sitting quietly with signs outside Isleworth Crown Court on Monday are prepared to risk arrest and even prison time. As the campaign of civil resistance inside and outside of British courtrooms grows and builds, some of those who have already been part of previous events have been told their cases have been referred to the Attorney General for review and the Attorney General has this week given a clear indication she plans to prosecute the cases. [12][13][14]In 2023 we have leaders, politicians and judges in the UK who are prepared to imprison people for  literally upholding the law. Melinda Janki, Guyana-based lawyer, and winner of the Commonwealth Rule of Law prize, 2023 said: “For decades ExxonMobil suppressed evidence that burning fossil fuels would destroy the global climate system. Today we in the Global South are living with the impacts. People are dying. Animals are dying. It is unconscionable and contrary to the rule of law for any judge to seek to suppress evidence of the destructive impacts of fossil fuels.” The five people quoted below are sign holders who will be present outside Isleworth Crown Court on Monday 17th July. El Litten, 36, a Web Developer from Luton said; “I’m doing this because it’s so important that the legal system does not stop people from telling the whole truth in court, and does not stop jurors from making the decision they think is right when they have all the information. Our society often seems to allows those in power to lie with impunity, but the truth – the whole truth – ought to matter. At times like these, it is more important than ever that rights which have been enshrined in law for hundreds of years are not abandoned.” Dr Katharine Fallon, 60, a retired GP from Windsford in Cheshire said; “I am a mum of two, and a retired GP. We know that around 2,000 people died in the UK last July due to extreme heat. In Europe last year, over 60,000 died from heat related illness. Jurors need to hear the truth that rising CO2 emissions cause these heatwaves. When making decisions about defendants who have acted in nonviolent civil resistance to protect everyone, they need to hear defendants explaining why they acted as they did.” Laura Clarke, 70, a retired social worker from Southend-on-Sea said; “The right to a fair trial is fundamental to any civilised society. It ensures that the actions of ordinary people are judged by their peers who make up the jury. But juries must have a full understanding of mitigating circumstances in order to understand then make their considered decision. We are in danger of losing our right to a fair trial.” David Lambert, 64, a historian from Stroud, said; “I am here because the principle of a trial by our peers is fundamental to English common law.  A defendant has the right to say who they are, what they did and why they did it.  A jury has a right to hear the whole truth.  Judges attempting to curtail those rights is a shocking abuse of power and must be resisted, peacefully and resolutely.” Mary Light, 78, a retired nurse from Totnes in Devon said; “I am a retired nurse, and a grandmother. I simply cannot ignore this issue – men and women on trial for peaceful civil resistance being forbidden by the judge to explain their motives. At the beginning of a trial the defendants swear “I do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth”. The new limitations mean they CANNOT provide ‘the whole truth’.”","https://juststopoil.org/2023/07/17/breaking-dozens-more-people-risk-prison-for-literally-upholding-the-law/",2
"153","Be careful what you wish for! Just Stop Oil responds to The Last Leg’s call for disruption of every event.. With disruption of The Last Leg",2023-07-14,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted the TV comedy talk show, the Last Leg on Channel 4. They are demanding that the UK government halt any new licensing or consents for oil, gas and coal extraction in the UK. [1] At around 10.00pm, three Just Stop Oil supporters ran onto the set of the Last Leg, during the live show, in a cloud of confetti and jigsaw pieces blasting the song ‘Hit Me Baby One More Time’ by Britney Spears- in reference to the viral video featured on the program last week. The three supporters thanked the Last Leg presenters, Adam Hills, Josh Widdicome and Alex Brooker for their support and gifted them their own hi-vis vests. Tonight’s action comes after the presenters called for a disruption before every sporting event on last week’s show. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Be careful what you wish for! Thanks to the Last Leg for their kind words of support. We have taken on board their suggestion to provide disruptions before every event, and have decided to begin with The Last Leg. We would like to extend an invite to Adam, Alex and Josh to join us on the streets next week, as we continue demanding an end to new oil, gas and coal licences in the UK.” One of those taking action today, Kush Naker, 33, a doctor of infectious disease from London, said: “I’d like to thank The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker for their support of Just Stop Oil’s action at Wimbledon last week, and their proposal to take time at every sporting event to highlight the climate crisis. We need to be taking non-violent action everywhere and all the time in order to force this cruel and inept government to make the only sensible decision which is to end all new oil and gas licences” “I love The Last Leg, this action is not against them in any way, but in fact an opportunity to invite the hosts of the show and all its viewers to join us in civil resistance against this criminal government.” William John Ward, 66, a retired civil engineer from Epsom, who gained notoriety by throwing a jigsaw and confetti at Wimbledon, last week, said: “I don’t want my grandchildren, nieces and nephews to suffer. Right now, millions of people are being forced to live in conditions that are beyond those necessary to support human life.” “I can’t let this happen. I’ve had five meetings with my MP, Chris Grayling, and he simply doesn’t get it. He doesn’t seem to understand the warnings from the United Nations, from the International Energy Agency and from the governments’ own climate change committee. I have no choice but to get the message out in whatever way I can. I’m retired and want to enjoy my retirement, but I feel I have no choice but to take action. I’ve tried everything else.” Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Just Stop Oil supporters Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker are serving three-year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal in the longest sentences for peaceful climate action in British history. It’s time to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance to end new oil, gas and coal. We are inviting everyone to come and march with us every day in London from the 16th-23rd July.

"154","‘We cannot afford to fiddle while Rome burns’- Just Stop Oil disrupt the Proms",2023-07-14,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted the BBC Proms. They are demanding that the UK government halt any new licensing or consents for oil, gas and coal extraction in the UK. [1] At around 8:40pm, two Just Stop Oil supporters ran onto the stage at the Royal Albert Hall, on the opening-night of the BBC Proms. They sounded whistles, whilst holding a banner which read ‘Just Stop Oil.’ The pair attempted to address the audience before being forcibly removed. One of those taking action today, Kate Logan, 38, A mum of two from London, said: “Many years ago I sang with a youth choir at the Albert hall, never imagining I would one day disrupt a performance here to draw attention to the planetary crisis we find ourselves in. But that’s what this has come to. Our leaders and the press have failed us for decades and now it’s up to ordinary people to demand the changes we need.” “We cannot afford to fiddle while Rome burns, our children need us to drop everything and act like this is the emergency it truly is. We need the BBC and the wider media to change their tune, tell the truth and connect the dots. The BBC is there to serve the public, it cannot be a mouthpiece of this corrupt government and its big oil pals.” Also taking action this evening, Pia Bastide, 29, a community worker from London, said: “I’m sorry to harp on about it, but business as usual isn’t working anymore. We can no longer ignore this crisis, when extreme temperatures are scorching Europe right now. Last week, the Secretary General of the United Nations said that the climate crisis is ‘out of control’.” “I refuse to accept that my future is being sold away, one new oil licence at a time, and do nothing. The government is undertaking actions that will kill millions and the BBC is not doing enough to hold them to account. It’s the same old song and dance of false balance, the downplaying of the emergency and repeating government lies.” Tonight’s action comes in response to the BBC’s underwhelming coverage of the climate emergency. In recent weeks the BBC has been accused of ‘false balance’ as well as uncritically regurgitating government and oil company propaganda. [2] A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Humanity is at risk, and so is everything we have ever created. Our works of art, our music and our traditions – we’re terrifyingly close to losing everything. Our cherished institutions like the BBC, are failing us. Along with the billionaire owned press, the BBC has failed to communicate the perilous urgency of our situation and they have failed in their fundamental duty to identify and hold to account those who are responsible.” “We are calling on the BBC to do better. You cannot remain ‘neutral’ on the breakdown of civilization. You cannot see both sides of extinction. You are either fighting for human survival or you are complicit with genocide.” “It is immoral for cultural institutions to stand by and watch whilst our society faces inevitable collapse. We call on everyone involved in media, arts, heritage and culture to join us in civil resistance.” Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial.

"155","Just Stop Oil march through John Lewis",2023-07-14,"Just Stop Oil supporters are approaching the end of their twelfth week of marching at least six days a week, since the 24th April. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 8:30am, a single group of around 40 Just Stop Oil Supporters started marching on Marylebone Road, near Baker Street station, before they split into smaller groups. The marches elicited polarised reaction from motorists and passers by, with pedestrians offering words of support, whilst one driver was seen shoving people, snatching banners and smashing a phone at 9am. The main march on Marylebone road was issued a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice and was off the road by 9:05. Smaller ‘mini-marches’ continued on surrounding roads. At 11:30 around 30 Just Stop Oil supporters entered John Lewis department store and held banners in the atrium of the store. Police arrived by 12:15 and the supporters left the shop by 12:50. The supporters then stood outside and gave speeches. One of those marching today, Patrick Hart, 37, a GP from Bristol, said: “I’m a doctor and I’m doing this for my patients. When it comes down to it, our health and the health of the ones we love is the most precious thing we have. The climate crisis is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. Every day that we delay action people are dying. I won’t give up until we see the changes that we need to stop the harm being done to us.” Today’s marches come as new research warns that The UK and Switzerland will see a 30% increase in the number of days of uncomfortably hot temperatures if the world heats by 2C. Researchers found that while central Africa will see the most extreme temperatures overall, it is mostly northern European countries that will experience the greatest relative increases in uncomfortably hot days. The people and infrastructure in these countries are not prepared for periods of hot weather, the study, based on climate modelling and data from the UK Met Office, predicts. The estimates by researchers at the University of Oxford are conservative, and do not include external factors such as extreme heatwaves, which would come on top of this average increase. [2] Chrissie Aslett , 62, a former NHS nurse of 32 years the said: “I am marching because the climate crisis is causing many thousands of deaths from excessive heat. This is only getting worse as more are displaced due to extreme weather events and crop failure. A recent report published in the respected journal Nature Sustainability, warns that by 2030, one billion people could be forced to move as the areas they live in become uninhabitable. As a Nurse I cannot stand by and let that happen.” Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to eight marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 800 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been around 244 arrests this year. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial.

"156","Six arrested as Just Stop Oil dads march through Selfridges",2023-07-13,"Just Stop Oil supporters are on the streets of Central London today, demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 8:00am, around 43 Just Stop Oil Supporters in four groups began marching in the City, Lambeth and Westminster. One mini-march at Hyde Park Corner was issued a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice and off the road by 8:30. At around 9:30 five supporters were arrested on Clapham Road in Stockwell, for breach of Section 12. All other marches were off the road by 9:30am. Hannah Hunt spoke to camera as she was led away by police. She said: “I’ve got more faith in the people I’ve marched with today and been arrested with than our government to look after the people in this country, because these people and myself have picked a side, we’ve not picked oil, we’ve not picked money. We’ve picked life and survival and that’s what you need to do as well, so please sign up for a slow march at juststopoil.com. It really is the least that you can do.” Further marches began from 10:45am around the City. At 11am a group of nine dads marched through Selfridges. This follows a march through Hamey’s Toy Store by a group of mums yesterday. The dad’s marched through the store with signs saying ‘fathers for a future’ and ‘will our children survive 3.5 degrees?’ at one point posing next to a Delorean, the iconic car from ‘Back to the Future’. The dads were muscled out of the store by security by 11:15am. At 11:30 a sixth person was arrested for breach of Section 12 on The Highway in E1. Further marches are currently under way. One of the Dad’s marching in Selfridges today, Adam Beard, 54, a Gardener from Stroud, said: “The famous clock above the entrance to Selfridges depicts mother time. This clock and statue was designed 80 years ago by Gilbert Bayes, my great great uncle. In 80 years time, if we carry on putting carbon into the atmosphere as we are now, we will likely have seen three degrees of warming, tipping points passed and runaway climate collapse bringing untold misery and death around the planet, as well as the complete breakdown of our society. I wonder what Gilbert would think about the legacy that we’re leaving our grandchildren” Sally Webber, 66, a former eye surgeon of 20 years, and a mother and grandmother, said: “I’m a scientist and I’ve spent all my professional life caring for my patients and helping train the next generation of surgeons. After I retired I became increasingly aware of the climate emergency and the madness of continuing to burn fossil fuels. If our children, grandchildren and doctors of the next generation are to survive we must JUST STOP OIL.” “We already have all the technology, creativity, energy and caring that’s required. It needs everyone to demand that our politicians, banks & the fossil fuel industry give the next generation a future. Political change comes when enough people demand it. Everyone needs to ask “what am I doing to protect the lives of our children?” and “is it enough?” Today’s action comes amid reports that Europe’s record breaking heatwave has claimed its first life this summer, prompting health warnings for tourists. The European Space Agency suggests that the heatwave has only just begun. Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Poland are all experiencing extreme heat. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia are expected to hit 48°C– potentially the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Europe. ESA reports that yesterday land surface temperatures reached over 50°C in Sicily, and Spain saw land surface temperatures reach 60°C.  [2][3] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April.

"157","Cllr Richard Morgan quits the Labour party after being suspended for taking action with Just Stop Oil",2023-07-12,"A town councillor for Bridgwater, who was suspended from the Labour party for taking action with Just Stop Oil, has now quit the party. [1] Richard Morgan, a renewable energy engineer, has been arrested twice with Just Stop Oil. The first at Kingsbury oil terminal in September 2022, the second a month later in central London – both for peacefully sitting in the road. His suspension came after the arrests were brought to the attention of government minister Grant Shapps by a Conservative councillor in Bridgwater. Richard’s actions at the time – and since – have drawn praise from fellow Somerset Labour councillors. He received no push-back from Labour until June, when Grant Shapps wrote an article in The Daily Mail calling for his suspension. In the piece, Shapps made accusations about Just Stop Oil’s influence on the Labour Party, whilst failing to mention the scientific consensus calling for an end to new fossil extraction, or the £3.5m the Conservatives received last year from fossil fuel lobbyists and high polluting industries. [2] Of his decision to quit the Labour party, Cllr Morgan said in a statement: “I’m sad to leave the Labour Party but the current leadership is clearly seeking to expunge those on the left, and it’s not a good place for any socialist at the moment. The treatment of my Constituency Labour Party has been appalling and I don’t trust Keir Starmer to honour his pledge of no new oil, gas, and coal.” “I have no intention of stopping my actions with Just Stop Oil, so – unless Labour U-turn on their support for peaceful protests – it’s likely I would have been on permanent suspension from the party.” “This week, Rachel Reeves called Just Stop Oil “pathetic”, which shows just how far away from its civil-resistance roots Labour has strayed. This issue should not be used as a political football. It’s life and death – and we’re rapidly running out of time to save ourselves.” “I took action for those I love and for all life on earth, because the future looks terrifying. Licencing new oil and gas in 2023 is an act of genocide and Labour could – and should – be calling this out. Not bowing to pressure from the fossil fuel zealots intent on destroying our country and our lives.” Morgan was remanded in HMP Pentonville in September after peacefully sitting in the road, blocking an oil terminal and was sentenced to 23 days’ imprisonment, suspended for a two-year period. Last week, in a trial at Stratford Magistrates court he was ordered to pay £336 costs for his October protest and given a conditional discharge of six months. Since he has not breached the Councillor’s Code of Conduct, he currently remains seated as an Independent. Two weeks ago, Cllr Brian Smedley, the Leader of Bridgwater Town Council wrote in the Bridgwater Mercury: “we in Bridgwater Labour Party firmly defend people’s right to peaceful protest and would point out that the climate crisis is real and happening and that the Daily Mail is not on the side of ordinary working people and never will be.” With Keir Starmer under continuing pressure for comments that he would honour new gas and oil licences issued before his election, the Labour Party remains split over an issue that the voting public and scientists are clear on. Polls have shown that climate policy will influence 54% of voters, and scientists are unequivocal that new oil and gas is untenable. This week, shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves called Just Stop Oil “tedious”, while on the same day Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norwich South tweeted in support of civil resistance, saying he’ll take “nuisance over the alternative” of climate breakdown any day. A spokesperson from Just Stop Oil commented: “What we find tedious is the Labour Party’s total lack of a spine in facing up to the oil industry who seek to profit from the wholesale destruction of life as we know it.” “Putting more carbon into the atmosphere in 2023 – and the years to come – in the quantities planned is nothing short of evil. It will bring about mass crop failure, drought, and starvation on an unimaginable scale. It will trigger the total collapse of our civilization, end the lives of countless millions of people – and shorten the lifespan of our children.” “Richard Morgan has been forced from the Labour Party for peacefully trying to protect our fundamental right to life. When we stand on the precipice of irreversible global heating and the loss of everything we love, he should be applauded not attacked.” “What’s become clear in the last few weeks is that Just Stop Oil is the only real opposition because we are the only people acting like we are in an emergency.” “New gas and oil is an act of genocide and we call upon every last person who cares about their families to pick a side: life or death – and join us in civil resistance before it’s too late. The next five years will be the most important in human history.” It’s time to pick a side and join in civil resistance to end new oil, gas and coal. We are inviting everyone to come and march with us every day in London from the 16th-23rd July.

"158","Just Stop Oil mothers march in Hamleys Toy Store",2023-07-12,"Just Stop Oil supporters have been slow-marching in Central London today. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 8:00am, around 71 Just Stop Oil Supporters in eight groups began marching in Southwark, Lambeth, and the City of London. A group of four marching on Tower Bridge were issued a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice and were off the road by 8:15. A group of six doctors, surgeons and GPs were issued an illegal Section 12 notice and forced off the road by 8:30. Two other mini-marches in Clapham and Tower Hamlets were off the road by 8:40. All other marches were off the road by 9am. Two marches, including the doctors ‘mini march’, were issued illegal Section 12 notices for the whole of London, despite the law stating that a Section 12 notice must be applied to a defined area for a defined time period. Further marches continued at 10am, including a ‘mums-march’ of 25 mothers, during which three mums were arrested for breach of a Section 12 notice. All marches were off the road by midday, however At 1:15pm, a group of around 15 mums began marching around Hamleys toy store holding signs such as ‘give our kids hope’ and ‘scared for my son’. The ‘mums-march’ was removed by security by 1:40pm. Angela Holland, 79, a grandmother of five, from Bristol, was one of those in the road today. She said: “Today at 1.2 degrees of global heating, the impacts of climate breakdown are everywhere and are becoming harder to ignore. We’re on course for my children to see nearly three degrees of heating in their lifetimes, and the implications of that are terrifying!” “Large parts of the world made uninhabitable, wet-bulb temperatures where high heat and humidity cause thousands to just drop dead, runaway feedback loops that bring about irreversible collapse, are just a few. Yet the UK government is still issuing licences for new oil and gas. Resisting this is the most important thing I can do.” The marches today come as scientists announced that the searing heat of last summer killed 61,000 people across Europe. Public health experts looked at the unusually high death rates and used epidemiological models to work out how many deaths could be traced back to high temperatures. They found 61,672 people died of heat-related causes in Europe between 30 May and 4 September 2022. [2][3] Another of those in the road today was Darcy Mitchell, 48, a mother from Totnes. She said: “I’m a parent, so I have to be here. This crisis has killed hundreds of thousands of children, and it’s getting worse in front of our eyes. I won’t let our government prioritise donations from fossil fuel interests over human lives. That’s my responsibility as a parent. My children know I will protect them.” Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 800 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been around 238 arrests this year.

"159","Just Stop Oil supporters disrupt rush hour traffic as Europe faces deadly ‘Cerberus’ heatwave",2023-07-11,"Just Stop Oil supporters were slow marching in London this afternoon. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] Starting at 4:33pm, three groups began marching from Picadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square. One march issued a Section 12 notice, with all leaving the road by 6:03pm. This action comes at the same time as news of an impending heatwave in the Mediterranean being delivered by a ‘Cerberus’ anticyclone weather system coming in from Africa. The hottest temperature ever recorded in European history was in 2021 when Sicily saw 48-degree heat. This heatwave is expected to breach that record. [2] Sara Makhmudova, 20, a student from Camden, was one of those in the road today. She said: “I am taking action with JSO because I have tried everything else and nothing has worked. We are now in the middle of the climate collapse which the government has been ignoring for decades. It’s clear that nothing short of mass disruption will force them to act.” “I am terrified for my future, the future of my 7-year-old niece and everyone else I hold dear, but most of all I am terrified for the billions of people in the global south who will be displaced or killed by natural disasters.” Prof Luca Mercalli, the president of the Italian Meteorological Society, said: “We know that there will be temperatures above 40C or 45C… We could get close to the record. Either way, the levels will be very high.” Heatwaves in Europe last year are believed to have caused more than 20,000 excess deaths. These heatwaves were less severe than what has been predicted for 2023. [3] [4] Also in the road today was Liz Rees, 39, a project manager from Cardiff. She said: “The International Energy Agency has stated that there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal if we are to stand a chance of maintaining a liveable planet.” “I am an auntie and not much is more important to me than my nephews. My civil liberties count for nothing while their futures are in jeopardy, and in 10 years’ time when they ask me what I did to try to save them, I need to be able to answer ‘everything that I could’. “The climate crisis is not an accident or an inevitability. Our leaders and institutions have the power, responsibility and ability to make the tough decisions that will mitigate its worst impacts and protect current and future generations. I am here asking them to step up, be accountable, and just stop oil.” Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April.

"160","Five arrested as Just Stop Oil supporters begin 12th week of continuous civil resistance",2023-07-10,"Just Stop Oil supporters are slow-marching again in London this morning. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] Starting at 7:59am, 60 supporters in 3 groups began marching in Kensal Rise, Hampstead, and Kensal Green. They were issued Section 12 Notices and were off the road by 9:00am. At 10:00am Just Stop Oil supporters began marches in Holborn, The Strand, and Oxford Street, causing disruption to the West End. Five were arrested for breaching Section 12 Notices that were placed in Holborn and Oxford Street. One of those arrested was Sue Parfitt, an 81-year-old vicar from Bristol. Sophie Holland, 52, a speech therapist and mother-of-three from Bristol was one of those in the road today. She said: “I am here for my three children. Their future is vanishing before my eyes with every week that our government does nothing to tackle the climate emergency. Stopping oil and gas licences is only the first step, and instead what we see is their criminal negligence with continued licensing and new deals for profit.” “I am also here in solidarity with hundreds of thousands of mothers in Somalia who are watching their children die in one of the worst humanitarian crises the world has ever seen. These scenes of starvation will be replicated in the UK before the end of this century unless we see radical action.” “I will not stay quiet while our children’s future is stolen. I know I will look back in five years and wish I had done more. It is life or death, and it is happening on our watch.” Yesterday, US climate envoy John Kerry singled out Just Stop Oil as an example of the growing civil resistance movement, hailing “a 66-year-old gentleman going out in the middle of the Wimbledon court, and demonstrating, and willing to be arrested – there is civil disobedience growing in communities around the world.” [2] Also in the road today was Matt Cooper, 48, a father-of-two from Bath.

"161","Confettigate: a statement from Just Stop Oil",2023-07-09,"The lady who threw confetti in Bruton yesterday was upholding a tradition that is common across many cultures.  We absolutely defend the right for people to throw confetti (of whatever colour) at weddings and other celebrations. If it was a form of protest (which is yet to be established) we applaud it and thank the person concerned. It was peaceful and not especially disruptive but got massive media attention for Just Stop Oil’s demand. It has also helped people to recall that George Osborne, one of the main architects of economic austerity, is directly responsible for over 300,000 excess deaths and that as a newspaper editor he was responsible for some of the most egregious climate denying nonsense ever to darken the pages of mainstream mass media. However, much as we applaud the use of orange confetti at this wedding we were not responsible. Perhaps the press could focus on something more important now? Like the current government’s plans to licence over 100 new oil and gas projects which will result in excess deaths the likes of which we have never seen. Or the fact that the UN Secretary General has said that ‘climate change is out of control’, as we’ve just seen the hottest average temperatures since records began. Or the fact that Canadian wildfires have now burned an area the size of Portugal. We are in catastrophically dangerous territory and the press have a moral responsibility to inform and educate people as to the causes of the crisis so that we can take action to defend ourselves. In 2023 it is simply criminal not to check your facts. Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"162","Just Stop Oil supporters continue their disruption after the hottest week ever recorded",2023-07-07,"Just Stop Oil supporters are slow-marching in central London this morning. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] Starting at 8:00 am, 26 supporters in 3 groups began marching in Vauxhall and Pimlico. Two marches blocked both directions of traffic on Vauxhall Bridge Road, which leads to Victoria. They were issued Section 12 Notices and were off the road by 8:21am. A third march in Vauxhall saw support from passers-by, whilst also experiencing aggression from road users, with a van forcing itself through the crowd. All marches were off the road by 8:38, but further marches are expected this morning. The marches this morning were spurred on by global temperatures reaching a new record average on Monday, topping 17 degrees Celsius for the first time, with Tuesday breaking that record again at 17.2 degrees. [2] Jane Touil, 56, is from Rochdale. She is visually impaired and was one of those marching in the road today. She said: “Licensing new oil and gas is a crime against humanity. I cannot stand by and do nothing, knowing that millions are going to die.” “Our government is lying about the need for new oil, gas and coal. We have the solutions and if we implement them quickly, climate breakdown will not be so severe. If we carry on this path, human civilisation will collapse within my lifetime and billions will die. It’s already starting to happen.” Not only did Monday see the hottest average air temperature in recorded history, but the record was immediately broken by 0.2 degrees the following day. Judging by these figures, from The University of Maine Climate Reanalyzer, analysts have said this may have been the hottest week on record. Dr Karsten Haustein, a researcher of atmospheric radiation at Leipzig University, said that July is likely to be the hottest month on Earth for at least 120,000 years; UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned that “climate change is out of control”, adding, “If we persist in delaying key measures that are needed, I think we are moving into a catastrophic situation, as the last two records in temperature demonstrates.” [3] A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “There is a direct link between pumping oil and mass human death. Last summer, we had a taste of it with thousands of excess deaths recorded during a heatwave. In Europe, we suffered the worst drought in 500 years, wildfires, and flooding – this will only get worse. It will claim more and more lives each year. That’s our family’s lives on the line. It’s time to pick a side – oil and gas profits or human life. New oil and gas is genocide, and oil pumped from the North Sea will be sold off by rich foreign investors without providing any energy security for the UK. Switching to renewable energy will secure jobs at home and stop deadly emissions.” Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been around 235 arrests this year. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Just Stop Oil supporters Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker are serving three-year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal in the longest sentences for peaceful climate action in British history. Time’s up for new oil, gas and coal. It’s time everyone got on the streets, marching every day to demand change. Join us to march from the 16th-23rd July.

"163","Just Stop Oil supporters continue marching after it’s revealed that Sunak plans to ditch climate pledges",2023-07-06,"Just Stop Oil supporters are slow-marching in central London this morning. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. Their action was spurred on by the fact that the UK Government is signalling that it may fail to honour its commitments to essential climate funds. [1][2] Starting at around 8:00 am, 25 supporters began marching in four groups in Southwark and Tower Hamlets. Two marches converged on Tower Bridge and were issued a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice and off the road by 8:30am. The mini-march in Vauxhall was issued a Section 12 notice and was off the road by 8:10. A mini-march in The City of London started at 8:52 and was issued a Section 12 by 9:15, just before Blackfriars Bridge. Further marches are expected later this morning. One of those marching today, Kate Bramfitt, 50, a mum-of-two from Hexham in Northumberland, said: “I read our local newspaper every week. There are always front-page stories about the threat to wildlife, schools closed because of flash floods, and fires linked to the climate. My teenage kids are growing up confronted by these threats. A friend’s 10-year-old son asked him, ‘What are you doing about the climate emergency, Dad?’. He didn’t know what to say. Then he joined Just Stop Oil and now he has an answer.” “We’ve all done everything we could to raise the alarm but this is an emergency and needs to be treated like one. I want a safer, healthier, liveable future for all of our kids. I know that it’s possible. No new oil and gas licences.” Commentators have said that Rishi Sunak risks “shattering” the UK’s global standing by slipping out of its £11.6bn commitments. Factors being blamed include the financial impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Over this period, the Conservative Government was accused of awarding £3.5 billion of corrupt contracts – over twice the amount spent on international climate finance in 2021/22 financial year. [3] [4] One of those in the road today was Catherine Rennie-Nash, 73, a retired teacher and grandmother from Kendal. She said: “This year the UK —and 72 other countries— experienced the hottest June since records began. This terrifies me – our government is doing virtually nothing to address one major cause of our collapsing climate: fossil fuels. I have no choice but to be in civil resistance with Just Stop Oil and do what I can for my children and grandchildren’s future and for the future of all people with no voice.” “I will do whatever it takes to non-violently expose the genocidal activity of this inadequate, self-serving government. Granting new oil and gas licences when we’re already deep into climate collapse is immoral and insane. I’m terrified that we’re losing all we hold dear.” Today, seven Just Stop Oil supporters will appear at Wimbledon Magistrates Court after being held overnight in police custody. Four were arrested yesterday for slow marching after police issued Section 12 notices. A further three who disrupted the Wimbledon Championships yesterday, will also be facing a magistrate this morning. Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th of April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events, there have been around 234 arrests this year.

"164","‘We can’t leave it to the next generation to pick up the pieces’- Just Stop Oil supporters disrupt Wimbledon in a cloud of confetti and jigsaw pieces",2023-07-05,"Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. They are demanding that the UK government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal. [1] At around 14:10 two Just Stop Oil supporters ran onto Court 18, disrupting the match between Sho Shimabukuro and Grigor Dimitrov. The supporters threw environmentally-friendly orange confetti glitter and jigsaw pieces onto the courts, before being removed. The game was delayed whilst marshals picked up the pieces, until rain once again halted play. One of those taking action today, Deborah Wilde, 68, a retired teacher from London, said: “I’m just an ordinary grandmother in resistance to this government’s policy of serving us new oil and gas licences. In normal circumstances this sort of disruption would be entirely unacceptable, but these aren’t normal circumstances. We’ve just had the hottest June on record, breaking the previous record by nearly a whole degree! We don’t need Hawk-eye to see that our government issuing over 100 new fossil fuel licences is a very bad line-call.” “Forget strawberries and cream, scientists are warning of impending food shortages, mass displacement and war. We are facing new pandemics, economic inflation and increasingly authoritarian governments who will attempt to crush civil unrest. This is a crisis and it needs a crisis response. I want a safe future, not just for my grandchildren but for all children around the world and the generations to come.” Also taking action, Simon Milner-Edwards, 66, a retired musician, from Manchester said: “I’m here for my grandchildren and everybody else’s. I’m not prepared to let our politicians wreck everything and leave the next generation to pick up the pieces. The last thing I want to do is spoil people’s enjoyment of Wimbledon, but right now, on Centre Court, it’s humanity vs oil and gas- and the umpire is getting every call wrong. How long are we going to take this before we see a McEnroe-level meltdown!?” After the game between Sho Shimabukuro and Grigor Dimitrov had concluded, Just Stop Oil then disrupted the second match of the day. One Just Stop Oil supporter stormed Court 18 in yet another cloud of jigsaw and confetti pieces, this time halting play between Katie Boulter and Daria Saville. The lone supporter was William John Ward, 66, a retired civil engineer from Epsom, he said: “I don’t like making a racket, but I don’t want my grandchildren, nieces and nephews to suffer. Right now, millions of people are being forced outside of the conditions necessary to support human life.” “I can’t let this happen. Our government is courting disaster. I’ve had five meetings with my MP, Chris Grayling, and he simply doesn’t get it. He doesn’t seem to understand the warnings from the United Nations, from the International Energy Agency and from the governments’ own climate change committee. I have no choice but to get the message out in whatever way I can. I’m retired and want to enjoy my retirement, but I feel I have no choice but to take action. I’ve tried everything else.” Today’s action comes as the Met office confirmed on Monday that June was the hottest on record, with the average monthly temperature of 15.8C exceeding the previous highest average June temperature, recorded in 1940 and 1976, by 0.9C. Paul Davies, Met Office chief meteorologist and climate extremes principal fellow said: “An increase of 0.9C may not seem a huge amount, but it’s really significant because it has taken the average daytime and the night time temperature for the whole of the UK. That’s significant in a warming climate and because of the consequential impacts on society.” [2] The Wimbledon Championships are currently under fire after signing a sponsorship deal with Barclays Bank, which has been accused of using the tournament as a means of greenwashing its reputation. Barclays gave $38bn (£30bn) to oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil, Shell and TotalEnergies, in the last two years. [3] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part.

"165","Just Stop Oil supporters slow-march through Harrods as El Niño arrives to supercharge the Climate Crisis",2023-07-05,"Just Stop Oil supporters are slow-marching in central London this morning. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 8am, 34 supporters began marching in six groups in Hammersmith, Victoria, Westminster,  Westminster Borough, Kensington, and Tower Bridge. Public reaction to the marches has been diverse, ranging from strong opposition, to shouts of support and encouragement. The mini-march on Tower Bridge lasted around 10 minutes before police issued a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice, forcing the march off the road. All six marches were off the road by 9am, with four issued section 12 notices. A further four marches continued from 10am, which saw four Just Stop Oil supporters arrested in Parliament Square, including Reverend Bill White, 68, a priest and grandfather, who was arrested for the third time this week for peacefully marching. All groups were issued Section 12 notices, many for a five mile radius from the marches, and were off the road by 10:50. Another slow-march set off from inside Harrods department store. Security was seen assaulting independent press photographers, wrestling them from the shop. Today’s marches come as the El Niño effect starts to impact our weather the world over; it is set to combine with carbon emissions to create record-breaking heat crises. Judy Judkins, a mum of three and grandmother of three, from Preston, was in the road today. She said: “I’m pursuing other legal methods to make changes but still think it’s necessary to be on the streets. We are in an emergency and I’m marching in the same way as those who won us universal suffrage, decent working conditions and LGBTQ+ rights to name a few. This is how we change the political conversation.” “All over the world, governments are choosing to silence those warning us how bad the situation is, rather than deal with the problem. Last week in France, the group ‘Les Soulèvements de la Terre’ was forcibly closed down by the police. Where does it end?” The climate emergency is set to be exacerbated by El Niño, causing impacts all over the world. “We can reasonably expect even an increase in infectious diseases because of the temperature,” said Maria Neira, Director for Environment, Climate Change and Health at the World Health Organisation. The weather event is known for directly impacting areas around the Pacific Ocean, but its impacts will be felt all over the world. [2] [3] Sue Houseman, a 53 year-old mother-of-two from Lancaster, whose family has been flooded out of their home, was marching in the road today. She said: “I am here because I can no longer sit back and watch this corrupt government sit back and take no positive action. Instead, they seem intent on committing arson on a monumental scale.” “The last straw for me was the Rosebank oil-field approval – no benefit for ordinary people, whilst throwing our money at fossil fuel companies. This will do nothing to alleviate the cost of living crisis or halt the climate breakdown.” Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been around 230 arrests this year.

"166","Just Stop Oil slow march from the hottest June ever recorded into the hottest July ever predicted",2023-07-04,"Just Stop Oil supporters are slow marching in Charing Cross and Marylebone today. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. [1] At 15:50 a group of 28 Just Stop Oil supporters set off marching down Marylebone Road. Police issued a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice by 16:15, forcing the procession off the road.  A further march is expected later this afternoon. Today’s marches come as it was confirmed that this June was the hottest in recorded British history, with the same expected for the current month of July. Kate Nisbet, 59, a carer from Leeds who was on the road today, said: “I am doing this for my grandchildren, so they and others across the world have half a chance of a safe home to live in, free from drought, crop failure and massive social unrest.” “I have learnt the hard way that you must stand up to a bully. This government is removing all of our civil rights to speak out against them; instead of talking about our very reasonable demand to stop looking for more oil to burn. Their actions are genocidal, against the European Court of Human Rights and against their own science advisors. This must be resisted.” The Met Office says the extreme temperatures the UK is facing are the “fingerprint” of the climate crisis. June 2023 was the hottest on record, both in average temperature and hottest recorded temperature, also being drier than average. Records date back to 1884, and this year broke records by a “considerable margin”. [2] Mike Holmes, 49, a father and sales manager from Warrington was in the road today. He said: “In the face of inaction by the government, I could no longer be a bystander and hope that other people would drive change. I wanted to support Just Stop Oil in calling for an end to new oil and gas licences, so here I am slow marching.” “The impact of challenges we will face, food shortages, droughts, and the collapse of the NHS, can be reduced if we all take action now. We need to put real pressure on our government to own the situation, tell the truth, and make plans for meaningful change.” “We have a moral obligation to do what’s right, it really is time to pick a side. What will you do?” Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been around 225 arrests this year.

"167","“I’m taking action for all children everywhere” – Just Stop Oil begin 11th week of slow marches as Sunak’s climate failings stack up",2023-07-03,"Just Stop Oil supporters have entered their eleventh consecutive week of slow marching today. They are demanding that the government halts all new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK. Over the weekend, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was rocked by a series of blows to his credibility after a series of failings on climate policy. A group of 34 Just Stop Oil Supporters began marching in Ealing, Hammersmith, Elephant and Castle, Bayswater, and Victoria. 19 people entered the road in Hangar Lane, West London this morning at 08:13am. They began marching on this arterial road, impacting traffic on the A406 and A40. Police issued a section 12 and they were off the road by 8:40. Reverend Bill White was arrested for peacefully marching in the road with a sign that said ‘Act out of Love’ on King Street in Hammersmith at 8:37. The march in Bayswater was issued a section 12 notice and was off the road after 20 minutes. All other marches were off the road by 9:25. Further marches are expected this morning. [1] Reverend Bill White, 68, a priest and grandfather from Macclesfield who was arrested this morning, said: “The situation we’re in demands no new oil, gas or coal. It’s not fair that others are suffering and dying, because of our addiction to burning oil.” “Our disgraced government can’t get this right without our help. They hear the message of the oil industry loud and clear, now they need to hear the voices of ordinary people, your voice. To protect our loved ones we must step off the sidelines and demand change.” “We can win this, come and join us, next Saturday, 12 noon, Parliament Square.” For his New Statesman column, Andrew Marr yesterday railed against the Conservative government and demanded a withdrawal from oil, gas and coal, saying: “we’re not thinking nearly enough about climate change… we can no longer say to other countries: stop using fossil fuels, stop going into gas, stop going into oil, stop building coal-fired power stations – we can’t do that, because we’re doing so little ourselves.” [2] [3] Environment Minister Zak Goldsmith abruptly left his cabinet role on Friday, citing that the UK “has withdrawn our leadership on climate and nature”, adding that Sunak was “uninterested” in the environment. To cap it all off, revelations that Rishi Sunak is failing to loosen the planning regulations that prevent onshore wind farms in the UK have caused major rumblings in the Tory party. [4] [5] Zoe Cohen, 53, a self-employed mum from Warrington was marching with Just Stop Oil today. She said: “I’m taking action for all children everywhere. For my daughter and for my three-year-old niece. She’s so little that she has no idea the world she has been born into, what awaits her, and how the Government is actively pursuing policies of new oil and gas that will shorten her life expectancy and worsen her quality of life. I wonder if she marched with me whether the police would arrest her too?” After 10:00am, Just Stop Oil supporters began another road of marches in Barbican, Islington, The Strand, Knightsbridge, and Kensington. Two more marchers were arrested. All marches were removed from the road by 12:10 by police, with a total of ten Section 12 orders being issued today by the Metropolitan Police. At Baron’s Court, a frustrated driver forced his car through the march before stopping his car out in the middle of the road to jump put and remonstrate with the marchers. Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part.

"168","Civil Resistance as the Heart and Soul of Queer Existence- A call to Action",2023-07-01,"As another Pride month is coming to an end with London’s much-anticipated Pride Parade, it’s important to reflect on the responsibility that we as members of the LGBTQIA+ community have: to stand in civil resistance against the greatest threat to our lives yet. The UK Government is planning to licence over 100 new fossil fuel projects, at a time of lethal heat waves, floods, and food shortages. In the face of the deaths of thousands, if not millions, ordinary people will be presented with a choice: either we come together and we fight for our lives – and the lives of every single person who is unable to fight for themselves – or we choose complacency, and allow the government to fund the deaths of our children. We can stand on the side of life, or on the side of murder. It is a simple choice to make, but one that so many have neglected to confront. There is no time to sit back and assume that someone else will stop the crisis for you. As long as the Government does not meet Just Stop Oil’s demand for no new oil, they are proving that they are hell-bent on destroying us. The demand is simple, obvious, and most importantly, life-saving. If the Government is not acting to save the lives of the people that they are sworn to protect, it is up to the people to hold them to account. You may be asking yourself: what does civil resistance have to do with me, as an LGBTQIA+ person? The answer is history. Our government has forgotten the fire that runs through the veins of every single LGBTQIA+ person, and what happens when that fire is fanned by injustice. They have forgotten that we lay our roots in the Stonewall Riot, ACT UP, and every single queer person who has lived, fought, and died for our rights. When the government hoped that we would lie down and die quietly during the AIDS crisis, we came together. Lesbians became nurses to the victims and led protests in their honour; transgender people fought tirelessly for our right to exist; we fought in solidarity and our community survived. Now, the Government once again expects us to go away, to die quietly. But we will not be quiet. We have not forgotten. Our Government has been corrupted by the fossil-fuel industry: they are in each others’ pockets and beds. To distract the media and general public from this, they are prosecuting anyone who tries to hold them to account. Such was the case with Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker who were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, with Marcus now facing deportation. This is just the beginning. The new Public Order Bill and surrounding protest-related charges are of course intimidating. But remember where you came from. If laws had not been broken in 1969 by the Stonewall Rioters, there would be no Pride today. If laws had not been broken in 1990 by OutRage! we would not be able to show our love for each other in public. Within the lifetimes of many in our community, existence meant breaking the law. We owe it to those who bravely stood up to an unjust system before us to continue breaking laws that counter our intrinsic human rights. What will you do when the Government once again takes away your right to exist freely, if not act? No one is going to fight for us so we must fight for ourselves. This fight includes standing up against those who claim to be on our side, like the organisers of London Pride. Partnerships with the Fossil Fuel Industry shame the LGBTQIA+ community at a time when much of the cultural world is rejecting all ties to this toxic industry, including The Royal Shakespeare Company, The BFI and Southbank Centre, Picturehouse Cinemas and the British Museum. Today we are calling for Pride to return to its roots. To once again stand against all injustice; to refuse to see LGBTQIA+ liberation as separate from other struggles for a better society and world. Pride has forgotten the protest for the sake of the celebration, but until we can be sure that we have secured a safe and happy future for the next generation of young LGBTQIA+ people, we are celebrating too soon. Now is the time to fight. No brand has ever fought our fight for us, and they aren’t about to start now. Don’t let the rainbows and #loveislove hashtags fool you. We demand that we be the last generation of queer people who has to fight for our own survival. If the UK Government continues criminally supporting the murderous fossil fuel industry, we will be the last generation. We can rise up against genocidal and exploitative governments and corporations, we can take back the rights that they are trying to strip from us. We can be the radical, beautiful people that our heritage has made us and demands from us. This fight will not be won with a petition, a rally, or a debate. It is won by civil resistance. When society collapses as a result of the climate crisis, if we are not prepared, who do you think will take power? Who do you think will suffer the most? While the climate crisis has killed so many people, and the cost of living crisis has forced us into desperation, queer people are already suffering destructive levels of dehumanisation and scapegoating. Dehumanisation and scapegoating will turn to assault and murder. We’ve seen this destruction begin in America, how long until the hatred makes it to us in the UK? Do you think you have time to wait and debate? How many of our community do we need to lose before we start to fight back? How many are you willing to let die? Death plagues the history of the LGBTQIA+ community. Do not let it plague our future too. Civil resistance is in our blood, and we will not stop fighting until we know that a safe and happy future has been won for the next generation. Ask yourself: when future generations talk about how the LGBTQIA+ community fought for our survival, will my name be mentioned? Remember who you are. Remember your history. Remember who you owe it to to join the fight.  Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. We demand a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

They are also calling on London Pride to cease accepting sponsorship money from high polluting industries and stop allowing the inclusion of floats from these organisations in the parade. [1][2] At around 1:25pm, nine LGBTQ+ Just Stop Oil supporters blocked the Pride parade in front of the Coca-Cola float- the world’s worst plastic polluter, accused of numerous human rights abuses. Some supporters blocked the float whilst two others sprayed pink and black paint over the road. This afternoon’s action comes after LGBTQ+ representatives from Just Stop Oil met with London Pride to discuss their demands, after it was revealed Just Stop Oil would consider disrupting the event. London Pride have so far failed to make a commitment to take necessary steps to protect the LGBTQ+ community from the unfolding climate collapse, and have failed to address their relationship with destructive industries co-opting Pride to ‘pinkwash’ their reputations. Meanwhile, at 1pm, a group of Just Stop Oil supporters set off marching from Parliament Square on their own Pride-themed slow march. James Skeet, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Pride was born from protest. It speaks to how far we’ve come as a community, that high polluting industries and the banks that fund them, now see Pride as a useful vehicle for sanitising their reputations, waving rainbow flags in one hand whilst accelerating social collapse with the other. It is queer people, and particularly queer people of colour in the global south, who are suffering first in this accelerating social breakdown. What would those who instigated the gay liberation movement, during the Stonewall riots in 1969, make of the corporatised spectacle Pride has now become?” “These partnerships embarrass the LGBTQ+ community, at a time when much of the cultural world is rejecting ties to these toxic industries. We call on Pride to remember the spirit in which it was founded and to respect the memory of all those who fought and died to secure the rights we now possess, whilst taking the necessary steps to protect our community long into the future.” Peter Tatchell (he/him), the legendary LGBTQ+ rights campaigner, and prominent member of the Gay Liberation Front and the civil resistance group OutRage! Said: “I helped organise the first Pride in the UK in 1972 and have attended every Pride London march since then. Pride was always meant to be both a celebration and a protest. From the outset, we stood in solidarity with other struggles for freedom and social justice, against corporate pinkwashing and all forms of exploitation. We saw queer liberation as just one aspect of a wider liberation movement.” “Climate destruction is destroying communities, jobs, homes and lives across the world, especially in poorer countries. Fossil fuels are endangering the survival of humanity – including LGBTQ+ people. Our community must not collude with environment, species and climate destroying companies.” One of those taking action today, Ben (she/her), 68 a retired librarian, from Hebden Bridge, said: “I’m a lesbian mother and grandmother. I came to my first Pride in 1985, and I remember being spat at in the street for holding hands with my partner, and the fear that our kids would be taken away because lesbians weren’t ‘fit’ mothers.” “Our community got to where we are through civil resistance (I did a bit of spray painting myself) and I think we owe it to young people today, especially this wonderfully diverse LBGTQIA community, to protect their future. That’s why it’s so important to fight to avert the coming climate catastrophe, and I want our Pride to be part of this, not to enable pinkwashing by fossil fuel funders and airlines. It’s time to Just Stop Oil!” Anna Holland (they/them), 21, a university student from Newcastle, said: “I went to Pride for the first time last year, and I was so disappointed to find that, instead of continuing the fight for the safety of LGBTQIA+ people, they were platforming companies like Barclays, United Airlines, British Gas, to name a few. I’ve previously seen floats from weapons manufacturers like BAE Systems!” “If Pride continues to allow the companies that are accelerating climate breakdown to Pinkwash themselves, then we have to fight back and show them that they are standing on the wrong side of history. As victims of oppression ourselves, LGBTQIA+ people must stand in solidarity with the victims of fossil fuel production. There can be no Pride in climate destruction and those who enable it.” Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Just Stop Oil supporters Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker are serving three-year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal in the longest sentences for peaceful climate action in British history . Just Stop Oil is calling on all queer people and allies to remember our roots, reclaim pride and join us in civil resistance against against new oil gas and coal.

"170","Another win for Just Stop Oil as Police fail to arrest student bail breakers",2023-06-30,"A group of student Just Stop Oil supporters disrupted traffic in Waterloo today, whilst three others defied their draconian bail conditions at Parliament Square. This is the tenth consecutive week of slow marches to demand an end to new oil, gas, and coal projects in the UK. [1] A group of 25 students began marching outside Waterloo station at 12pm and continued for almost half an hour before receiving a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice from the Metropolitan Police and leaving the road. The students elicited strong reaction from the public, receiving both support and hostility from some quarters. The students then proceeded to Parliament Square, to witness three students defying their draconian bail conditions banning them from ‘protesting without police permission’ for the next three months. The students then sat down on the pavement outside the Houses of Parliament with placards and gave speeches through a megaphone. The repressive bail conditions had been imposed on the three after they were arrested for peacefully sitting outside Total Energies headquarters on Tuesday. 27 students were arrested that day, many of whom have had similar bail conditions imposed despite not being charged with any offence. A Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “This criminal government is threatening young people’s lives by encouraging new oil and gas and changing the law at the behest of big oil corporations to ensure that no-one can stop them.” “The Met Police’s arbitrary imposition and enforcement of vague bail conditions is part of a campaign of intimidation to silence young people, who have every right to defend themselves against a government that is intent on annihilating their futures. The Police’s failure to arrest these three breaking bail is a tacit acknowledgement that they have overstepped their authority.” “This illegitimate Prime Minister is now openly boasting that the laws the police are enforcing were written with the aid of dirty oil company money and we already know that the government has bypassed parliament in order to impose them. This from a political party that took £3.5 million in bribes last year from the fossil fuel industry. Corporations have overthrown democracy.” “We must assert our centuries old right to resist. Every right we have was won through civil disobedience – the right to strike, the right to vote. The stakes at this moment in history are higher than they have ever been.” “We will continue to take reasonable, proportionate measures in defence of our young people, and all those on the frontline of climate collapse in the UK and around the world. ” On Wednesday this week, the Prime Minister revealed that the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which seriously restricts the right to protest, was written in collaboration with the Policy Exchange – a notorious and influential right-wing think tank funded by oil giant ExxonMobil. Rishi Sunak previously worked at the think tank before becoming Prime Minister. [2][3] One of those in the road this morning, Tara Vellani, 22, a Psychology student from Manchester said: “I have been marching with Just Stop Oil this week because I am sick of seeing people, primarily in the Global South, constantly suffering as a result of the choices our government is making, and so we are coming together to demand no new fossil fuel licences.” “Being sat with my friends in front of the Total headquarters on Tuesday and watching at least half of our group get arrested for simply sitting on the floor was a complete attack on our right to freedom of speech and assembly, at a time when we all need to be speaking out.” Evan Usher, a 19-year-old student from Leeds was also marching in the road today. He said: “The reality that my generation is living with, is one in which we can’t have children without knowing that we’ll have to raise them in a world without food security, where there are annual deadly heat waves, where hundreds of millions of people are forced to flee from their homes as they are pushed outside conditions that are suitable for human survival. We have to face that prospect every day.” “Once you realise that the climate crisis is something that’s been done to us by a very small number of people, it becomes very clear what has to be done. I don’t feel I have a choice in this anymore.” On Tuesday of this week, seven Just Stop Oil supporters sprayed black and orange paint over the exterior and interior of the Total Energies headquarters in Canary Wharf, East London in resistance to the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project they are principally funding. This project will displace 100,000 people, wreaking devastation to homes, farms, and landscapes in Uganda and Tanzania, as well as produce monstrous amounts of carbon emissions that are accelerating climate collapse. [4] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been around 217 arrests this year over 60 people have been charged with various offences including failure to comply with Public Order Act (section 12) conditions. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial.

"171","LGBTQ+ supporters of Just Stop Oil issue statement on London Pride",2023-06-30,"We are a group of LGBTQ+ supporters of Just Stop Oil. We have been taking action against the licensing of new oil, gas and coal in the UK, repeatedly putting our bodies and our liberty on the line, in resistance to a government which has been bought by corporations and fossil fuel capital. We take action because the government is continuing to develop new fossil fuel projects in 2023, even though the world’s climate scientists agree that this threatens the collapse of our food systems and the breakdown of ordered society. [1] As those of us in the queer community are acutely aware, this government is stoking culture wars against us, with a particularly virulent focus on trans and non-binary folks. They do this as a means of distracting the wider public from their criminal incompetence; however their policies threaten our safety, both directly and indirectly. The climate crisis they are facilitating has already killed, and made homeless, millions of people including many LGBTQ+ people. In the coming decades, hundreds of millions of people are likely to be forced from their homes as conditions become unsuitable for human survival. Scientists are warning of mass displacement, famine and war. We are facing new pandemics, economic inflation and increasingly authoritarian governments who will attempt to crush civil unrest. It is queer people, and particularly queer people of colour in the global south, who are suffering first in this accelerating social breakdown. Pride was born from protest. It speaks to how far we’ve come as a community, that high polluting industries and the banks that fund them, now see Pride as a useful vehicle for sanitising their reputations, waving rainbow flags in one hand whilst accelerating social collapse with the other.

If London Pride fails to take these basic steps necessary to protect our community, we will have to consider potential escalations which may result in the disruption of Pride. We will also call for the entire LGBTQ+ community to join us in protest and boycott – for the safety of LGBTQ+ people everywhere.

"172","Time’s Up",2023-06-30,"Why we are in civil resistance Our system is killing us. The root of the wreckage we see around us is a broken democracy, not a broken climate. Climate chaos is just a symptom of the endless greed of the powerful – who won’t stop until they’ve trashed even what they need to survive. This reality is so terrifying that we all want to believe it’s not true. Surely our lives are in good hands, minus a few bad apples. But for more and more people, these last shreds of comfort are going up in wildfire smoke. We’re told to watch the world burn while politicians license new oil – and still obey? If that makes your head and heart explode, there’s only one place to go: Civil Resistance. It’s the step we take when we definitively turn our backs on the criminals in power, refusing to give them one more second of our time and respect. All over the world, this is happening. A Glasgow community spontaneously gathers to save neighbours from deportation. The Stop Cop City movement in Atlanta refuses to let the police raze the forest for a vast training complex. People block the subway in New York, in rage and defiance, after homeless black man Jordan Neely was murdered. Just Stop Oil’s partners in the A22 network send shockwaves across Europe – blocking roads, throwing paint over private jets, turning fountains black. Like these sister movements, Just Stop Oil is clear about what civil resistance means: we no longer consent to a system that doesn’t care if we live or die. A system so dysfunctional it’s willing to sacrifice us to a clique of criminals profiting from shortened lives, hunger and despair. Resistance means we no longer cooperate with a state that holds us in utter contempt, lies to us and treats us as worthless. If the State has no regard for us, we owe it nothing in return. The good news amongst all this darkness is that civil resistance works. It’s not a miracle cure by any means, but the balance tips decisively in its favour. It’s got rid of dictators like Serbia’s Slobodan Milosevic, brought down segregation in the US, won votes for women, removed the British from India, and helped Polish trade unionists free themselves from Soviet oppression. Just Stop Oil could be just months away from joining this roll of honour. The techniques of civil resistance can include strikes, boycotts, blockades, cultural disruption and occupations. Its results are just as varied. Civil resistance sometimes wins by sparking mass mobilisation, compelling people to leave the sidelines and join in. Sometimes by dividing the State against itself, winning over police and the judiciary. Victory can also come from raising the costs of keeping a system going – until it’s easier for the oppressor to give way. But behind all these tactics and objectives is the absolute withdrawal of consent from a system that’s failing in its duty to provide protection, care and justice for ordinary people like us. Here, this failure is stark. Our government takes our hard-earned money, via taxpayer subsidies, and pours it into new oil and gas projects, which will lead to misery, deprivation, suffering and death. It breaks its own climate targets, marching us towards social, economic as well as environmental collapse. It lies to us and gaslights us – telling us new oil will cut our energy bills when we all know it’s going to be sold for profit on the global market, at a global price. As one of our spokespeople, Emma Brown, put it so clearly in an interview: ‘The British public isn’t silly.’ We know we’re being lied to. We know we’re being thrown to the wolves. If you can’t un-know these horrifying truths, join us in civil resistance before it’s too late. Policy and legislation can’t get us the change we need. They can codify the progress we make – but that will come afterwards. Now is the time to resist and that means all of us. The method will work its magic, but not without you.

Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"173","“Politicians have failed for 50 years”- Just Stop Oil students march after damning report on government inaction",2023-06-29,"Just Stop Oil student supporters are marching in central London to demand that the UK Government halts all licences and consents for new oil, gas, and coal projects. This is the tenth straight week of marching in London to demand that the government takes basic steps to protect the public from climate collapse. [1] At 8am, 47 Just Stop Oil supporters in four groups began marching in Kensington, Southwark, the City, and the West End. As one of the demographics most at risk to the detrimental effects of climate breakdown, this week is led by students who are demanding action to safeguard their future. A mini-march on Fleet Street was issued a section 12 notice and forced off the road by 8:15. A march on New Kent Road was moved off the road by police at 8:30, after they issued a section 12 notice. All teams were off the road by 9:20. Further marches are expected this morning. On Tuesday, 27 young people were arrested. Many of these were wrongfully arrested for simply sitting outside the headquarters of Total Energies in Canary Wharf, which had previously been painted by a small group in defiance of the company’s environmental and human rights abuses in the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. Many of those wrongfully arrested have subsequently been given bail conditions forbidding them from protesting ‘without police permission’, in breach of the human rights act. A Just Stop Oil Spokesperson said: “The Climate Change Committee report reveals in graphic detail how broken our democracy is. The government is criminally disregarding its most fundamental duty of care to its citizens while the opposition is too cowardly to effectively challenge them.” “The truth is that putting more carbon into the atmosphere in 2023 will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society. The IPCC itself has said that unless urgent action is taken, young people will face five times as many extreme events – such as heat stress, drought, poverty and hunger – as previous generations. These catastrophic impacts will combine to shorten their lives and they know it.“ “New oil and gas is the greatest criminal act in human history and politicians who conspire to support it are complicit in mass murder. The next thousand generations’ very existence is dependent on what we do right now. Just Stop Oil is on the right side of history, which side will you be on?” [2] One of those on the road this morning, Oliver Sworder, 20, who is studying Biology at Oxford University, said: “I’ve spent two years studying biology and the collapse of the biosphere; every single lecture points to the issue, and the first easy, obvious solution: stopping any new oil, gas and coal. I’ve spent so long supporting Just Stop Oil from afar, thinking ‘they’re doing good things, I should do that one day’. But there’s no time left, so I’m finally taking action.“ “If you think that a few students blocking a road for a few minutes is an inconvenience, wake up. Given the state of the situation, which calls for so much more, walking on a road is the least anyone can do.” Another taking action with Just Stop Oil, Ben Johnson, 26, a PhD Student from Oxfordshire, said: “I’m here because I don’t want my mum to go hungry. When climate collapse leads to food shortages, we will be panic buying like in the pandemic. My mum, in her wheelchair, won’t be able to get to the supermarket shelves before they are cleared in front of her.” “I’m also here because politicians have failed for 50 years to stop the progression of the climate emergency. In the face of this, I don’t see many options other than resistance. We can’t vote our way out of climate breakdown.” “The science is clear. We cannot invest in new fossil fuel projects and avoid climate breakdown. This is an emergency on a scale humanity has never before seen: it requires an emergency response.” Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been around 217 arrests this year over 60 people have been charged with various offences including failure to comply with Public Order Act (section 12) conditions.

"174","It’s ‘just not cricket’ to licence new oil, gas and coal whilst the climate crisis knocks us for six- Just Stop Oil disrupt The Ashes",2023-06-28,"Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted The Ashes 2nd test match, at Lords cricket ground, between England and Australia. The Just Stop Oil supporters are demanding the UK government immediately halt new oil, gas and coal projects in the UK, and are calling on Lords to make a statement demanding an end to new fossil fuels. [1] At around 11:05am, three Just Stop Oil supporters stormed the pitch at Lords in a cloud of orange powder-paint. The supporters were removed from the pitch, one being carried off by Jonny Bairstow. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “Cricket is an important part of our national heritage, but how can we enjoy England vs Australia when much of the cricketing world is becoming unfit for humans to live in? We can no longer afford to distract ourselves when the sports we play, the food we eat, and the culture we cherish is at risk.” “It’s time for cricket lovers and all those who understand the severity of this situation, to get onto the streets and demand action from this illegitimate, criminal government. When our children ask us ‘what did we do’ to avert this crisis, we better have a good answer.” One of the people taking action today, Judit a 69 year old grandmother from Epsom, said: “My family were refugees from Hungary in 1956 when I was a young child. I despair for all the desperate people who have to leave their homes and countries because they are no longer able to feed their families or eke out a livelihood. It is estimated that there will be over 1.2 billion displaced people by 2050 because of the climate emergency.” “I have worked in environmental education since the 1980’s. We knew about the dangers of global warming then, yet nothing much has happened. I have to take action for my seven beautiful grandchildren. I can’t bear to imagine the suffering that they will have to endure because of this government continuing to licence new oil, coal and gas, against all better judgement and expert advice.” Reports indicate that cricket will be the hardest hit of all the major pitch sports by the extreme conditions wrought by the climate crisis. Much of the cricketing world is at serious risk. In recent weeks, Asia has been experiencing a historic heatwave, with some Indian cities experiencing temperatures over 44C. Climate scientists are warning that this could be the year where summer temperatures in India pass the wet-bulb threshold of 35 degrees – a measure incompatible with human life. 230 million people around the world live less than one metre above sea level, including nearly 75% of Bangladesh – and sea levels are rising. 33 million people were displaced in Pakistan last year due to extreme flooding. [2][3][4] Lords cricket ground boasts about being powered by 100% renewable energy; yet their ‘principal partner’ is JP Morgan, the world’s worst “fossil bank,” that contributed $317 billion in fossil fuel financing from 2016 to 2020, and continues to ‘greenwash’ to distract from business as usual.

"175","Just Stop Oil supporters march against EACOP in London as Ugandan students are arrested in Kampala",2023-06-27,"Just Stop Oil supporters are marching in London to show support for students campaigning in Kampala, against the East African Crude Oil Pipeline in Uganda. This is the tenth week of slow marching on the streets of central London to demand that the UK Government halts all licences and consents for new oil, gas, and coal projects. [1] At around 11.15 am, 34 Just Stop Oil supporters began marching on London Bridge. As one of the groups most at risk to the detrimental effects of climate breakdown, this week, students will be marching every day to demand an end to new oil, gas and coal. The march was stopped by police at around 11:30 am as it reached the middle of the bridge. Today’s march is in solidarity with Students Against EACOP, a group of Ugandan students in resistance against the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. This morning, a group of brave students marched to the Ugandan parliament in Kampala to demand that lawmakers take a clear position against the EACOP pipeline. Bagiire Sharif, a student from Kyambogo University has been arrested and remains in detention. Those speaking out against the pipeline in Uganda risk police brutality and imprisonment. There have also been incidents of forced disappearances and kidnappings recorded. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “We are calling on the Ugandan authorities to immediately release Bagiire Sharif. The international community is paying close attention to the treatment of these peaceful protestors. The illegal detention of Bagiire Sharif is a human rights violation that underlines the authoritarian pact between EACOP Ltd and the Ugandan Government.” One of those on the road in London today, Kostja Solveig Junglas, 27, a PhD student in archaeological sciences from Oxford, said: “As an archaeologist, I am aware that no society has ever faced environmental change at the scale we are experiencing now and will experience even more so in the future. In the past, far smaller-scale changes in the environment than we are currently experiencing have caused immense suffering.” “If we were to take lessons from the past seriously, we would realise that we have to take immediate action to minimise the global suffering that is already happening on a massive scale.” Another taking action with Just Stop Oil today is George Simonson, 22, an engineering graduate from London. He said: “This government is fucking us over. Continued oil and gas extraction will be a death sentence for millions across the globe. I’m terrified about what life will be like when I get older. I used to be excited about growing old, having a family and settling down. But I don’t think about that future anymore.“ “If this government doesn’t stop new oil and gas, I’ll grow up into a society filled with social unrest, food and water shortages, war and conflict. Students from around the country and around the world are tired of governments screwing them over. The cost of living crisis, the climate crisis, it’s all connected by corporate greed and corrupt politicians. Young people have had enough, that’s why we’re taking matters into our own hands.” Yesterday, weather forecasters said that Britain is expecting a further five heatwaves, with two stints of unusually hot temperatures in early and late July, two more at the start of August and another in September. They refused to rule out the possibility that another stint of 40-plus temperatures could blast the UK within weeks. Last year, the extreme conditions resulted in thousands of excess deaths, with the London ambulance and fire services on black-alert. 60 families lost their homes as wildfires destroyed more than 90 buildings. Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said “We got 40C last year and before that happened, no-one thought there was an outside chance.” Adding that “there’s a possibility we do continue to see those trends.” [2][3][4][5][6] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part.

"176","Students Against EACOP Uganda Unite in Non-Violent Protest Against Harmful Project",2023-06-27,"Students Against EACOP press release- 27th June 2023 Uganda, June 27th, 2023: Today, in a historic display of solidarity, Students Against EACOP (East African Crude Oil Pipeline) joined forces in a peaceful protest march to the Parliament of Uganda. The united student community, in a concerted effort to protect their future and the environment, are delivering a powerful petition to honorable members, urging them to halt the EACOP project due to its detrimental impact on the student community and beyond. As representatives of the vibrant we recognize the urgency of addressing the dire consequences that the EACOP project poses. Our collective voices speak for the countless young minds who are deeply concerned about the environmental ramifications, economic inequalities, and potential displacement of local communities resulting from this venture as illustrated in our petition with attached evidence. EACOP, as a crude oil pipeline spanning across Uganda, Tanzania, and international waters, raises alarming concerns regarding its impact on climate change and biodiversity. Our generation understands the urgent need for sustainable solutions and demands a shift towards renewable energy sources. We firmly believe that investing in clean, green technologies will pave the way for a healthier, more prosperous future Furthermore, the EACOP project threatens to disrupt the lives and livelihoods of countless Ugandan communities, including our fellow students. The potential displacement of families and disruption of local economies will not only jeopardize education but also perpetuate social and economic inequalities. We stand united in advocating for justice and equity, ensuring that the voices of marginalized communities are heard and respected. The non-violent protest march to the Parliament of Uganda is a testament to our unwavering commitment to peaceful activism and constructive dialogue. We applaud the honorable members and urge them to exhibit their will to engage with the concerns of the student community. We implore them to consider the long-term implications of the EACOP project and take immediate action to halt its progress. The petition delivered today is a culmination of tireless efforts and extensive research conducted by Students Against EACOP and Justice Movement Uganda. It represents the voices of thousands of students who are determined to safeguard our shared future and protect the environment for generations to come. We sincerely hope that our plea resonates with the honorable members, fostering a genuine dialogue and inspiring tangible steps towards a more sustainable and equitable Uganda. By halting the EACOP project, we can redirect our efforts and resources towards embracing clean energy alternatives, preserving our natural heritage, and cultivating a prosperous future for all. Together, as students, activists, and concerned citizens, we stand united against the EACOP project. We call upon the honorable members of Parliament to champion our cause and prioritize the well-being of our communities and the environment.

"177","Just Stop Oil Students paint Total Energies HQ in resistance to Ugandan pipeline atrocities",2023-06-27,"Just Stop Oil supporters, acting in solidarity with ‘Students Against EACOP’ have painted the UK headquarters of Total Energies orange and black, in resistance to the companies’ continued participation in human rights violations, in the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). The Just Stop Oil supporters are demanding an end to new oil, gas and coal projects in the UK, and Students Against EACOP are demanding an immediate suspension of the destructive pipeline in Uganda. [1][2] At around 8am four Just Stop Oil supporters entered the UK headquarters of Total Energies, the French multinational and majority shareholder in the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) at Canary Wharf. They sprayed the interior of the lobby with black paint from fire extinguishers. Meanwhile outside, four further supporters sprayed the exterior of the building with orange paint and then sat down to await arrest. They were joined by a group of about 60 students who gave speeches describing the crimes perpetrated against the people of Uganda by the EACOP project. Experts have described the project as a ‘carbon bomb’, which would release over 379 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere- 25 times the combined annual emissions of Uganda and Tanzania, the host nations. [3] Todays’ action is in solidarity with Students Against EACOP, a group of Ugandan students fighting against the environmental devastation and human rights violations being wrought by the project. At the same time as this morning’s action, around 50 Students Against EACOP supporters are planning to march to the Ugandan parliament in Kampala to demand lawmakers take a clear position against the EACOP pipeline. They are anticipating brutal repression with many of the participants likely to face arrest and imprisonment. A spokesperson for Students Against EACOP, said: “Total Energies are involved in grave human rights violations. Thousands of people have lost their property and many have been evicted from their land with little or zero compensation. Those who have raised their voices to speak-out against the dangers of EACOP have been silenced. Journalists have been arrested, there have been incidents of forced disappearances and kidnappings. “This pipeline is destroying national parks, lakes and rivers, causing massive ecological damage and displacing wildlife. We are calling on everyone in the UK to come out and resist Total Energies for its direct participation in these criminal acts. Many financial institutions have refused to underwrite this project and if Total Energies backs off, the government of Uganda would have a hard time funding this project, so we can win.” One of those taking action at Canary Wharf this morning, Solveig, 27, a Doctor of Philosophy student at the University of Oxford, said: “I believe that it is my duty to support the brave protesters of Students against EACOP, who are standing up to Total Energies as it destroys the lives of people for profit. The extractive colonialism executed by Total is not only making 100,000 people homeless, but it will exacerbate climate breakdown globally. I wish we could stop these atrocities through peaceful and quiet protest, but we can’t. This is why I have to stand up to Total and push for the de-funding of EACOP.” In October, a group of over 50 Ugandan university students were brutalised after marching to deliver a petition on the pipeline to the European Union Embassy in Kampala. Nine students were imprisoned and are currently facing trial on a charge of common nuisance. [4][5] The pipeline runs 900 miles from a biodiverse national park in Uganda, to a port in Tanzania. The project could lead to the displacement of over 100,000 people and outrage has been sparked at the multitude of human rights abuses being imposed on those in the path of construction. The EACOP pipeline will cut across several ecosystems, including forests, wetlands and rivers, displacing wildlife and destroying vital habitats that support rich biodiversity. The main backers of the multibillion dollar project are Total Energies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). [6] Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Just Stop Oil supporters Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker are serving three year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal. [5] Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance against new oil, gas and coal. The time is now. Join us and slow march while you still can. Our indefinite campaign of civil resistance is underway and will not end until our government makes a meaningful statement halting new fossil fuel projects in the UK.

"178","Students demand action to safeguard their future",2023-06-26,"Just Stop Oil supporters are commencing their tenth week of slow marching on the streets of central London to demand that the UK Government halts all licences and consents for new oil, gas, and coal projects. [1] At around 8 am, 59 Just Stop Oil supporters, in four groups, began marching on key roads in North, West and South London. It is the students’ turn to march and young people will be taking to the streets every day this week to demand action from our criminal government. All four marches were issued section 12 notices and off the road by 9:30. Further marches are expected later this morning. Public reaction has been mixed, with the usual signs of support from sympathetic public, contrasting frustration from some corners. A group of teens implored marchers to keep amplifying their message, calling out “tell them again!” Moments later a car was driven into students on Camberwell Green SE5 at 8:50am. In Archway N19 one member of the public leapt to the defence of the Just Stop Oil supporters when another bystander attempted to physically intervene in their march, de-escalating the situation with the words “brother listen – you can’t physically touch somebody”. One of those on the road this morning, Arthur Clifton, 22, a student from Devon, said: “I have been called many things whilst marching with Just Stop Oil, but strangely the one that has stuck with me the most is ‘unreasonable.’” “If what I am doing is unreasonable then 33 million Pakistanis wrenched from their homes by floods must seem reasonable. Then 1.2 billion climate refugees in a couple of decades is reasonable. Then 3.6 billion people living in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate collapse is reasonable.” “I do not believe this unimaginable heartbreak, loss, and death is reasonable. I am being ‘unreasonable’ alongside the United Nations, the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who all say there can be no new oil and gas. If this is where the line is drawn, I encourage everyone to be as unreasonable as possible for as long as it takes.” Another of those taking action this morning, Hannah Smith, 20 a student from London, said: “As one of the leading polluting countries of the world, we have a responsibility to make sure we don’t continue. Historically, we are the eighth biggest emitter and with the huge diversity of renewable sources we have available we have all the resources to leave fossil fuels behind.” “This situation is fixable and it is in everyone’s best interests to do so. It would ensure energy security, at a fraction of today’s prices. That’s why the government is resisting change; a small number of people are getting very rich off the current sky high energy costs. We are here because we have hope that things can be better.” This morning’s marches come as nearly half a million people in India have been affected by severe flooding, killing at least 19, whilst thousands have been evacuated. There were similar scenes of flooding and evacuations in Chile, with officials stating they’ve been at the receiving end of the worst weather front in a decade. Meanwhile, Texas and other parts of Southern America are facing a record-breaking heatwave, which experts have ascribed to “human-caused climate change”. [2][3][4] Droughts ravaging Uganda and other parts of East Africa have left hundreds dead and show no sign of abating, with half a million facing starvation. At the same time, a spate of lawsuits and civil actions against agents of the climate crisis are in motion globally. They range from the Oregon county suing fossil fuel companies for a fatal heatwave they endured in 2021, to Sarah Finch who is taking Surrey Council to court in order to challenge new permissions for oil drilling in the area, to students in Uganda fighting to avoid prison after they were brutalised and arrested for peacefully protesting the maligned “carbon bomb” EACOP pipeline. [5][6][7][8] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been over 160 arrests this year and 50 people have been charged with various offences including failure to comply with Public Order Act (section 12) conditions. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Just Stop Oil supporters Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker are serving three year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal.

"179","Don’t Deport Marcus: Public march to demand Home Office end deportations of peaceful demonstrators",2023-06-24,"Supporters of Just Stop Oil, Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and many others are joining forces in a show of solidarity and resistance to march to the Home Office today. They are demanding an end to new oil and gas and that the government end its deportation proceedings against one of the QE2 bridge climbers. [1] Marcus Decker, a German citizen, who has leave to remain in the UK, faces automatic deportation after serving one of the longest sentences in British legal history for peaceful civil resistance. Together with Morgan Trowland, he climbed the QE2 bridge as part of Just Stop Oil’s six-week campaign of daily disruption in the capital last October. [2] Indigo Rumbelow, a spokesperson from Just Stop Oil, said: “We will be sending a clear message to the Home Secretary that the cowardly ‘double punishment’ of peaceful people in civil resistance to stop government criminality and protecting the lives of their families will not go unchallenged. We’re demanding that Marcus stays in the UK and is not deported at the end of his sentence so that he can remain with his family, friends, and stepchildren.“ Today’s march, which will start at Parliament Square at midday, will be joined by hundreds of supporters from a range of climate groups that Marcus is involved with. This includes Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain, Just Stop Oil, and Haringey Community Action Network. The march will make its way from Parliament Square to the Home Office, with speakers including Peter Kennard, Marcus himself (via telephone from prison), and his partner Holly Cullen-Davies who will speak on the impact Marcus’s absence is having on their children. A petition calling to secure Marcus’ right to remain in the UK has already reached over 77,000 signatures. Lord Deben, former Conservative MP for Suffolk Coastal, said: “These people are doing what they’re doing because we are not moving fast enough – and we have to. The whole political establishment should realise these protests come from people who are desperate because they realise our future is emperilled because we’re not doing enough. I want everyone to realise how absolutely urgent it is – they ought to be in touch with their MPs, and they ought to make themselves a nuisance in every circumstance they can because we have to act now.“ Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb, former Deputy Mayor of London, said: “I have watched this awful piece of legislation going through which is already the cause of deep repression. I want to send a message of solidarity to Marcus and Morgan – I am so sorry that you’ve had to suffer this and I hope that we can do something for you. For me, you represent martyrs – and there will be others. Solidarity.” Just Stop Oil’s campaign continues nationwide – today 15 supporters in Northampton were threatened with arrest after marching in the road for about 200 metres. Simultaneously in Lancaster, 14 marched on the A6 before taking their protest to a shopping centre. Yesterday Just Stop Oil supporters disrupted traffic for over an hour during a slow march in Chippenham, Wiltshire. On 25th May after spending eight months in prison, and one month after being found guilty of the charge of Public Nuisance, Marcus received a letter from the Home Office indicating that he faces automatic deportation to Germany. This means Marcus would not be able to return to his partner and family upon release. Although Marcus is appealing his draconian prison sentence of two years and seven months, his case is not expected to reach the Court of Appeal until at least January 2024. [3] Marcus is a German citizen who has made his home in the UK. He is an upstanding member of his local community who undertakes voluntary work alongside his professional career as a teacher and musician. He received a custodial sentence of two years and seven months for scaling Dartford QE2 Bridge in October 2022 with Morgan Trowland. Their action, part of a six-week campaign of actions by Just Stop Oil to demand the UK Government halts new fossil fuel licences, led to traffic delays as the bridge was closed for more than 41 hours. Both men were immediately remanded to prison and have so far been held for nine months in HMP Chelmsford and HMP Highpoint. [3] Legal expert Melanie Strickland, from Lawyers Are Responsible, said: “The Home Office says it’s ‘not conducive to the public good’ for Marcus to remain. But it clearly is. Marcus stood up for our futures against our ecocidal and increasingly authoritarian government. Breaking up families is not conducive to the public good. We stand in full solidarity with Marcus, Morgan, and all climate activists fighting for our futures.” Marcus and Morgan’s case has become a ‘cause célèbre’ nationally, with an outpouring of support recognising the state of the UK government’s depravity in sending ordinary people to prison for longer and longer sentences amidst the backdrop of increasing climate breakdown, unprecedented wildfires, floods and famine. Iconic musician Peggy Seeger addressed her thanks to the pair: “You didn’t expect to go to prison for what was, until recently, a human right… thank you, thank you, thank you – you’re on our minds.” END Press contact: 07762 987334 Press email: [email protected] High-quality images & video here:https://juststopoil.org/press-media Website: https://juststopoil.org/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JustStopOil/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/just.stopoil/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/JustStop_Oil Youtube: https://juststopoil.org/youtube Notes to editors: [1] https://juststopoil.org/2023/04/21/bridge-climbers-get-3-years-in-longest-ever-sentence-for-peaceful-climate-action/[2] https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12144097/German-Just-Stop-Oil-protester-scaled-Dartford-Crossing-bridge-faces-deportation.html [3] https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/30/section/32 [4] https://www.facebook.com/events/s/dont-deport-marcus/791138829252931/ [5] https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-deportation-of-a-peaceful-climate-activist [6] Just Stop Oil is a coalition of groups working together to demand that the government immediately halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK.

Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

[1] At around 8 am, 28 Just Stop Oil supporters, in four groups, began marching on key roads near Vauxhall, Waterloo, Fleet street and Islington. A frustrated white van man was seen shunting marchers with his vehicle on Millbank at 8:05. Two marches were issued section 12 notices and forced off the road by 8:20. One march had no traffic behind, so couldn’t even meet the threshold of causing minor disruption. The two remaining marches were off the road by 8:35, one having been forced off after a lorry attempted to run over the mini-march at Highbury Corner. Further marches are expected later this morning. One of those on the road this morning, Mella Shaw 45, a Teacher from Edinburgh, said: “I am here for my son and all the young people who currently have a terrifying future of climate chaos ahead of them. I can’t just stand by, be silent and do nothing, while this government ignores even the recommendations of its own scientific advisors.” “I am here so that I can look my six year old son in the eye and tell him that I am doing everything I can to give him a future. I have to do everything I can to stop this criminal government issuing more oil, gas and coal licences.“ Another of those on the road this morning Felix Lozano, 60, a graphic designer from Hastings, said: “I don’t want to be causing disruption, in any other circumstance walking in the road would be totally unacceptable, but what else can I do? If I stood on the pavement I’d be ignored, but by causing disruption it forces the conversation.” “I have to put my body in the way of business as usual. We cannot continue ignoring this crisis pretending everything is fine. Our home is dying; we need action now.” Today’s marches come as a new study published yesterday warns that Ecological collapse is likely to start sooner than previously believed. The study models how tipping points can amplify and accelerate one another. Based on these findings, the authors warn that more than a fifth of ecosystems worldwide, including the Amazon rainforest, are at risk of a catastrophic breakdown within a human lifetime. “It could happen very soon,” said Prof Simon Willcock of Rothamsted Research, who co-led the study.

"181","Just Stop Oil: We are the Real Opposition",2023-06-22,"Just Stop Oil responds to news that Ed Miliband, Shadow Secretary of State for Climate Change and Justin Rowlatt, the Climate Editor for BBC News, have been banned from speaking at Glastonbury Festival, because representatives from Just Stop Oil are also speaking at the event. [1] We understand that Ed Miliband, the former Labour Party Leader, has been forbidden by the Labour Party leadership from attending the Glastonbury Festival where he was due to share a platform with Just Stop Oil co-founder Indigo Rumbelow. Justin Rowlatt, who was due to share a platform with Just Stop Oil’s Sarah Lunnon, has been banned by the BBC. The event is scheduled to feature a number of talks over the weekend with representatives of Just Stop Oil. Just Stop Oil issued the following statement: Contrast the cowardice of Ed Miliband and Justin Rowlatt, with the actions of Dale Vince and Gary Lineker, who in recent weeks stood up for something in the face of far-right mudslinging. History will be kind to those who did what was right, regardless of whether or not it elicited the ire of the Daily Mail. The only Real Opposition in Britain is Just Stop Oil, because only we are speaking the truth and acting as if that truth is real. The Labour Party is led by a pathological liar, who rose to leadership on falsehoods, in what was one of the most dishonest leadership campaigns in recent history. They are already rolling back on their pledges to halt new oil and gas and they have no intention of stopping the projects that this illegitimate, zombie government is furiously rubber-stamping, in one last-ditch arson spree. No new oil and gas is not ‘a policy’ – it is a question of whether you decide to commit mass murder. It’s a question of whether you put into question the very continuation of the British state and our society. Throughout history, every authoritarian regime with genocidal aspirations has been facilitated by a weak political opposition, as well as the legions of collaborators, bureaucrats and people ‘just following orders’ that continue business-as-usual. In the UK we have a pantomime democracy. It has been bought by oil companies, hedge fund managers and media billionaires who sell us the lie that the status quo can be maintained. The truth is that putting more carbon into the atmosphere in 2023 will bring about the wholesale destruction of ordered society. It will destroy our ability to grow food. It will destroy the world trading system and create permanent depression. It means the collapse of our health systems, education systems; it means the loss of our pensions and savings, and don’t even mention law and order. It is all going to be beyond fucked. The next thousand generations’ very existence is dependent on what we do right now. Just Stop Oil is on the right side of history, which side will you be on? The revelation comes in the wake of backtracking by the Labour Party over their pledge to halt licensing of new oil and gas. Keir Starmer has said that if Labour wins the next election, he would not block any new oil and gas developments agreed by the Conservatives between now and then. This includes the massive Rosebank oil and gas field, which is expected to get the government’s green light within weeks. Labour have also watered down their £28bn a year ‘green investment’ plan.

[1] At around 8 am, 24 Just Stop Oil supporters, in four groups, began marching on key roads in Camden, Battersea, Wandsworth and Borough. At 8:10 a frustrated resident threw a bucket of water over a ‘mini-march’ of six people on Rochester Road in Camden. A section 12 notice was placed on Tower Bridge at 8:13 until midnight tonight, forcing the marchers off the road. All marches were issued section 12 notices and were off the road by 8:50. Further marches are expected later this morning. Yesterday, three people were arrested for marching in the road to demand action on the most critical issue facing us as a species, bringing the total arrested for marching since April 24th to 129. One of those on the road this morning, Ru Kenyon, 44, a teacher from London, said: “I’m 45 years old and the climate crisis has defined the whole of my adult life. My heart breaks for how it must feel for young people today to understand what’s happening. We could turn this situation around, if we come together as a global community and treat it like the emergency that it is.” “I hate causing disruption, but my conscience says I have to put myself in harm’s way by marching in the street, in the same way those demanding change have done for hundreds of years. If I could speak to the Prime Minister I’d tell him he needs to get out of the way quite frankly, along with the entire corrupt establishment, and let the young get on with dealing with this crisis. But he may as well make amends first by announcing the end of all new fossil fuel licences in this country” Another of those taking action this morning, Paul Bleach, a gardener and fulltime carer from Portsmouth, said: “We are marching in the road because sadly all other forms of dissent are ignored. For example, I attended the Extinction Rebellion ‘Big One’ event over Easter this year. Over 60,000 people outside parliament received almost no media coverage, and most certainly no response from our government. As Chris Packham said “what options are we left with?” “Citizens are being denied sufficient information and support by our corrupt government and the media. This is the mother of all humanitarian problems, there is no, and will never be, a bigger crisis. Where the heck is the sense of urgency from global governments?” This morning’s actions come as a YouGov poll commissioned by the Sun newspaper has shown huge cross party support for measures to achieve net zero carbon emissions. This is despite a major attempt by right-wing newspapers over recent months to promote a backlash against any attempts by ordinary people to tackle the climate crisis. The poll showed that 65% of the public support measures to achieve net zero carbon emissions, with just 19% opposing it. There was cross-party support for net zero, with 54% of Tory voters supporting it, whilst 31% opposed it. Despite the mounting evidence that an overwhelming majority of the public now support efforts to achieve net zero, these startling facts were conveniently missed from the headlines – in keeping with the paper’s divisive agenda. [2] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. Including arrests at the Coronation and cultural and sporting events there have been over 160 arrests this year and 50 people have been charged with various offences including failure to comply with Public Order Act (section 12) conditions.

"183","Cllr Richard Morgan challenges his Labour Party suspension over taking action with Just Stop Oil",2023-06-21,"A Town Councillor from Bridgwater, suspended by the Labour Party after this was called for by Tory Energy Secretary Grant Shapps, has today spoken out in defence of his actions with Just Stop Oil. [1] Just Stop Oil supporter Richard Morgan was suspended by the Labour Party on the 17th of June 2023 after the Conservative Energy Secretary Grant Shapps published an op-ed in the Daily Mail the day before, calling for his suspension and ridiculing his scruples for taking action on the climate crisis. The protest in question took place in September 2022, more than six months ago, with no qualms from the Labour Party until this recent Tory challenge. [2] Shapps’ article made fatuous statements about Just Stop Oil’s influence on Labour policy, but this latest development begs the question: why is Labour under the influence of Grant Shapps? [3] Councillor Richard Morgan, a renewable energy engineer has made the following statement: “I can confirm I have been administratively suspended by Labour and I will be challenging that suspension. The Labour Party was built on protest and should be supporting our democratic rights not helping get rid of them. “I have joined the protests because I am at the end of my tether and sick of the suffering being caused by the continued unnecessary use of oil, gas and coal for energy. I am afraid for my loved ones and for all life on Earth. The government is continuing to issue new licences despite all the major expert bodies saying this is the wrong thing to do, and people are dying and will continue to die as result. And not just people, we are talking about total ecosystem collapse. “I stand by my actions and will continue until the government takes real action and calls an end to new oil, gas and coal licences. I call on all ordinary people like me to join us before it’s too late.” Elected in May 2022 as a Labour councillor for Fairfax East on the Bridgwater Town Council in Somerset, Richard Morgan unseated Tory incumbent Cllr Diogo Rodrigues. In September of that year, he took action with Just Stop Oil as part of our ongoing civil resistance campaign to demand the UK Government halt all new fossil fuel licences. He was arrested for sitting in the road outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal, along with 50 other protestors. He was remanded to HMP Pentonville before being sentenced to 23 days’ imprisonment, suspended for a two-year period. [4] Cllr Morgan was applauded by his peers in Somerset Labour, for taking action with Just Stop Oil whilst being excoriated by his rival, Cllr Rodrigues – a local operator who switched party allegiances twice in 2019. The Councillor’s Code of Conduct stipulates a “custodial or suspended sentence of three months” minimum to be eligible for removal as a councillor. Morgan has not breached this, so he currently remains seated as an Independent. [5] In the last few days Labour leader Keir Starmer has pledged to “not grant licences to explore new fields in the North Sea” while at the same time coming under fire for insisting that Labour would honour any licences in existence at the time of the next election and for rowing back on Labour’s pledge to invest £28bn a year in green industries. [6] A spokesperson from Just Stop Oil remarked: “The only real opposition in Britain is Just Stop Oil because only we are speaking the truth. The truth is this: putting more carbon into the atmosphere in 2023 will end civilisation because it will destroy our ability to grow food and end global trade. Governments will run out of money and water, health services will collapse, pensions and savings will have no meaning. Law and order will be a memory. Richard Morgan shouldn’t be penalised for taking the side of ordinary people against a fossil fuel industry that is driving an irreversible climate crisis for their own profit. Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak must understand that new oil and gas equals climate catastrophe in our own country. No new oil and gas is not just a matter of policy; it’s a question of whether to secure or destroy the United Kingdom. Any nation that digs for fossil fuels is perpetrating a genocide against countless millions now, and every future generation thereafter. The next five years are the most important in all of human history. Everyone must pick a side.”","https://juststopoil.org/2023/06/21/cllr-richard-morgan-challenges-his-labour-party-suspension-over-taking-action-with-just-stop-oil/",1
"184","Just Stop Oil supporters march as government paves way for 19th Century energy policies",2023-06-21,"Just Stop Oil supporters are once again slow marching on the streets of central London, in their ninth week of daily action to demand that the UK Government halts all licences and consents for new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] At around 8 am, 38 Just Stop Oil supporters, in four groups, began marching on key roads in Hammersmith and Bow. They continued for around an hour, before police issued S12 notices. All the marches ended by 9 am. Further marches are expected later this morning. One of those on the road this morning, Linda Lancaster, a grandmother of three, from Bognor said: “I am marching this morning out of concern for my grandchildren. Rishi Sunak thinks that he can licence over 100 new fossil fuel projects, destroying not only my grandchildren’s futures, but his own daughters’ futures as well. The scientists are telling us, there can be no new oil, gas and coal projects if we want to survive. Even the oil company scientists were saying it decades ago!” “What Just Stop Oil is calling for, is a sensible basic first step in dealing with the breakdown of our climate, improving our energy security and reducing our sky-high energy bills. It will free us from dependence on international energy markets. Get on with the job Rishi! It’s what everyone (apart from oil company CEO’s) wants you to do.” Another of those taking action this morning, Claire Brook, 56 a therapist from Brighton, said: “I am taking action today to demand a safe future for all young people. While our government continues to invest in new oil, gas and coal projects, they are choosing profit over life.” “We have so little time to make the changes needed to avert the full extent of the climate catastrophe. I believe that engaging in civil resistance is the only course of action we have left. It’s time to pick a side and be on the right side of history. Sign up to march at juststopoil.org.” This morning’s marches come as the government attempts to implement further regressive policies that bear resemblance to 19th century ideas, rather than ideas fit for the 21st century. It was announced that the government plans to remove a ban on opening new coal mines from a bill that is going through Parliament. Green MP Caroline Lucas called the decision “reckless” and Lord Teverson said it was “totally and absolutely obvious” that building a new coal mine “would be a really stupid thing for a country to do”. Meanwhile, in a transparent attempt to hamper progress away from the dirty energies of the past, the government is planning to ditch measures put in by the House of Lords that would enable small community renewable energy projects to sell electricity directly to local consumers. [2] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April. Over 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. To date there have been over 100 arrests and 40 people have been charged with failure to comply with Public Order Act (section 12) conditions. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. Just Stop Oil supporters Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker are serving three year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal. We stand with these political prisoners, with the 1,800 victims of the UK’s broken criminal justice system, imprisoned for over a year without trial, and with the 1,700 murdered across the global south, for protecting all our lives. Thousands are dying every year from unnatural temperatures and extreme weather events, and this will soon rise to millions. Ordinary people must come together to resist this criminal government and hold them to account for their genocidal policies. [3][4] Just Stop Oil is calling on everyone to get off the sidelines and join in civil resistance against new oil, gas and coal. The time is now. Join us and slow march while you still can.

"185","Just Stop Oil supporters slow march again to resist new oil and gas",2023-06-20,"Just Stop Oil supporters are slow marching on the streets of central London to demand that the UK Government halts all licences and consents for new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] At around 4:50 pm, 26 Just Stop Oil supporters began marching on Queen Victoria Street, near Mansion House tube station. They continued for around 25 minutes on key roads through the City, before police issued a S12 notice bringing the march to a close by 5:15 pm. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “What is happening in this country is outrageous. As the world hovers over the dangerous 1.5 degree warming threshold, our corrupt government is too busy arguing about lockdown parties to care that they are shuffling our children into the furnaces.” “Meanwhile, we have a spineless leader of the ‘opposition’ already rolling back on promises to halt new oil and gas projects, before anyone’s even gone near a voting booth. Democracy has failed; overthrown by oil companies and corporate interests. Our leaders are on course to murder hundreds of millions of people, because they need yet another new yacht. Civil resistance is our only option to sort this out. Sign up to march at juststopoil.org.” One of those on the road this afternoon, Nicola, 58, a charity manager and mother of two, from Brighton said: “I’m feeling so scared for my childrens’ future. For my own peace of mind I need to take action with Just Stop Oil. The world’s top scientists are all telling us we need urgent action to stop the worst effects of climate breakdown.” “I can’t stand by and do nothing. I’m taking action with Just Stop Oil because I’m so scared about the future my children and all young people face, if we don’t move urgently to slow this crisis. Governments need to act on the alarms that are sounding.

"186","An open letter to the British LGBT Awards",2023-06-20,"Dear British LGBT Awards Directors, We are a group of LGBTQ+ activists who are part of Just Stop Oil standing in solidarity with Fossil Free Pride who will be taking action on the night of your event. We are writing this open letter to demand that you: reject all involvement and sponsorship of the British LGBT Awards by the fossil fuel companies and the banks that fund them, issue a statement to demand that the government end new oil and gas; and, encourage your peers to join us in civil resistance. We are in an unprecedented climate emergency which is being catastrophically fuelled by the oil and gas industry. As a result of corporate greed, the UK has faced food shortages, floods, and heatwaves. Millions of people in East Africa are facing starvation due to drought; Pakistan is still suffering from last year’s devastating flood; and wildfires have destroyed 13.3 million acres of Canada so far. This is only a small percentage of the scale of devastation caused by the climate crisis. By signing the complete IPCC report, our Government has made it clear that they are aware of this enormous threat as well as the cause of it, but they are continuing to fund the murderous industry that is causing so much destruction. Knowingly causing the deaths of millions by acting in the interests of the fossil fuel industry is not just illegal, it is genocidal. By choosing to accept sponsorship from BP, Shell, and the banks that fund them the British LGBT Awards is choosing the side of genocide. Fossil fuel partnerships shame and embarrass the LGBTQ+ community at a time when much of the cultural world is rejecting all ties to this toxic industry, including The Royal Shakespeare Company, The BFI and Southbank Centre, Picturehouse Cinemas and The British Museum. As you know, 1 in 5 LGBTQ+ people – and 1 in 4 transgender people – have experienced homelessness (Stonewall research) at some point in their lives. LGBTQ+ young people are already four times more likely to become homeless than their non-LGBTQ+ peers. When the climate crisis means that we will have to fight for loaves of bread, many of us won’t be able to afford to house ourselves or pay our bills, and thousands of homes will be destroyed every year, who do you think will suffer first? In the face of sponsorship deals from the billionaires who are forcing us to choose between resistance or death, it seems you have forgotten to put our safety and futures first. We in the LGBTQ+ community will not allow the deadliest and most dangerous companies to use our existence to greenwash and rainbow wash their brands. This is a line in the sand for us. No company should be involved in the British LGBT Awards whose business model includes knowingly killing LGBTQ+ people. We urge you to think again and act to put things right by excluding these sponsors from all aspects of this year’s British LGBT Awards, and the fossil fuel industry from all future awards. It is shameful that in 2023, when the climate crisis has killed so many people, and fossil fuels are undoubtedly the leading cause, you still have chosen to take money from such abusive and negligent companies as Shell and BP. While we are aware that you may say that it is too late to cancel sponsorships, the science tells us that it is now or never. It is NEVER too late to choose the side of life. Please attempt to right this wrong by publishing a statement of regret over your decision, and agreeing to distance your event entirely from the fossil fuel industry now and in all future circumstances. The climate crisis is a war between the fossil fuel industry and everyone else. Civil resistance is in our blood, and we will not stop fighting until we know that a safe and happy future has been won for the next generation. Yours sincerely, Just Stop Oil Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

[1] At around 8am, 45 Just Stop Oil supporters, in three groups, began marching on roads in Stratford and Ealing. Police issued S12 notices bringing all the marches to a close by 8:45am. Further marches are expected to take place later this morning. One of those on the road this morning, Arran Allison, 49, a woodworker and father of three, said: “I’m forced to take this action as the government is determined not to listen to other forms of appeal. I worry so much about what the future holds for my children.” “I cannot stand by and watch the government continue on this high carbon path of licensing over 100 new fossil fuel projects, despite them being branded ‘hypocrites’ by their own Tory peer, who chairs their Climate Change Committee. We know disruptive civil resistance works, so that’s why I’m on the road this morning and you should be too.” Another of those on the road this morning, Rosie Moran, 65, a former social worker from Tunbridge Wells, said: “It’s time to pick a side – staying neutral will only advantage the government who are failing to undertake their primary task of protecting the people and safeguarding the future of our children and grandchildren.” “I don’t want to be doing this – I would rather be playing with my grandson than disrupting people’s journeys but ordinary people coming together is one of the most powerful tools we have to achieve change as history has shown. We cannot achieve the level of change needed by individual action – recycling, lifestyle changes, being ethical shoppers – we have to have government action and we have to have it now.” This morning’s marches come as scientists confirmed disturbing news that the world breached – for a time – the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold this month, as they issued warnings on how fast humanity is approaching the critical warming limit set by the Paris Agreement. The first 11 days of June were the hottest on record for this time of year, the European earth observation programme, Copernicus, reported. It isn’t the first time that the world has hit 1.5C; but it’s evidence that warming is increasing as countries break their pledges to cut emissions – taking us to “point of no return”, according to scientists.

[1] At around 8am, 42 Just Stop Oil supporters, in four groups, began marching on roads in the City, South and West London. Two of the marches were “mini marches” of three or four people. One of the mini marches was cleared off the road by police after only 5 minutes. All the marches finished by 9am, further marches are expected later this morning. One of those on the road this morning, Jessica Upton, 53, a veterinary surgeon, foster carer and mum of two, from Oxfordshire said: “I’m a vet, foster carer and mum. I do not stop caring in my time off, so I’m in the road to get our government’s attention. They need to step up and do what’s right and stop issuing any new fossil fuel licences. The United Nations agrees with me on this!” “I’m on the road and I’m frightened, but it beats being at home doing nothing. The solutions ARE out there to ensure jobs, clean energy and prosperity for all, but our corrupt government seems to be blind to them.” Another of those on the road this morning, Maggie Lippiett, 72, Retired palliative care nurse from Cambridge, said: “I am deeply concerned about the climate crisis and I have found that other ways of expressing concern fall on deaf ears. I have three children and six grandchildren and I need to be accountable to them. I am not prepared to stand aside and do nothing. I feel a deep responsibility to influence power to stop issuing new licences for gas and oil exploration. Making lifestyle changes has not been enough.” Whilst the UK government is subsidising the fossil fuel industry to the tune of 230 million pounds a week, and creating tax incentives to encourage new oil and gas projects; new polling has found that 54% of Britons prefer tax cuts to be focused on renewables, compared to only 15% who think they should be given to oil and gas companies. [2][3][4] This is whilst the industry is reporting record profits, due to hikes in the price of wholesale oil and gas on the international market. The government has also effectively banned onshore wind, through complicated planning regulations, despite lifting a moratorium on wind farms. It was reported that the Conservative party accepted 3.5 million pounds in donations from polluters, fossil fuel interests and science deniers in 2022.

They are demanding that the UK Government halt all licences and consents for new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] At around 5:20pm, Just Stop Oil supporters blasted air-horns and set off glitter canons during ‘Dialogues des Carmélites’, which is being performed at the world-renowned festival. They then displayed a Just Stop Oil banner as they attempted to address the audience, before being forcibly removed from the venue. One supporter was assaulted by an audience member. One of those taking action this afternoon, Sean Irving, 24, a PhD Student, from Norwich, said: “I am here because I am scared for my generations’ future. I am angry that our illegitimate government, corrupted by oil money, is actively and knowingly pursuing a course of action that threatens all of our lives and the lives of our children.” “By signing off on the development of over a hundred new fossil fuel projects, the government signs the death warrants of hundreds of millions; who face crop-failure, displacement, war and famine.” “The pursuit of new fossil fuel projects in 2023, is moral and economic madness. Our culture cannot survive sustained crop failure.” Another of those taking action, Pia Baas, 29, a community worker from London, said: “This government is sacrificing everything we know and love, to enrich themselves. But you cannot eat money! We are on a course for mass hunger and societal collapse if we do not act urgently.” “Our cultural institutions have failed to admit this truth and failed to address the urgency of action. It is immoral for cultural institutions to stand by and watch whilst our society faces inevitable collapse.” “We call on art and cultural institutions, like Glynbourne, to make a statement demanding that the government end new oil, gas and coal. Those working in cultural institutions must join in civil resistance against this criminal and illegitimate regime.” Today’s action comes as John Gummer, the outgoing Conservative peer, who chairs the U.K.’s Climate Change Committee, has told Politico that the government is “failing fundamentally” to adequately cut emissions. He said that the current stance in favour of expanding production of fossil fuels, meant that the U.K. had “perfectly properly been called hypocrites.” He stated that new oil, gas and coal licences were “not only unnecessary, but set a bad example to the world.” Adding that, “we can’t ask other people to restrain their production, if we don’t do it ourselves, there are no two ways about it!” [2] Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been over 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial.

Nine supporters were arrested for failing to comply with a section 12 notice issued on a march at Hanger Lane. All the marches finished by 8:45am. One of those arrested this morning, Allie Law, 23, a programmer from Bury St Edmunds, spoke to camera whilst detained: “I’m Allie, I’m 23. I’ve just been arrested under section 12 of the Public Order Aact, for exercising my democratic right to march, protected by the United Nations. I’m being searched, as if I’m going to hurt anyone, when they know we’re completely nonviolent; unlike our government.” “The government has been told by their own advisers that continuing to licence fossil fuels will kill millions, but they don’t seem to care! It could be to do with them getting paid a lot from fossil fuel companies…I couldn’t possibly comment on that. Join us at juststopoil.org.” Another of those on the road this morning, Christopher Ford, 46, a nursery school teaching assistant from Cambridge, said: “As a father of two sons and a nursery school teaching assistant I am terrified for the future of younger generations and I am horrified by the response of the government to the climate crisis. The United Nations and scientific institutions around the world are screaming that we need to stop the development of new fossil fuels to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. Yet our government is ignoring them and their own scientific advisors by releasing over 100 new fossil fuel licences!” “They are putting their profits before my children’s safety and as a father I must do what I can to protect them. The corruption and profiteering within our government is at epidemic proportions, public disaffection is at its highest and the new laws they are bringing in are designed to squash all dissent, breaking international human rights laws as they do so. Protest is now effectively banned.” Another of those taking action, Canon Dr Peter Lippiett, 76, a Retired GP and Anglican priest, from Twyford said: “I’m marching for my grandchildren. It’s madness that our leaders are sleepwalking us into a climate catastrophe. The science has never been clearer, we know that burning fossil fuels is raising the planet’s temperature beyond ‘safe’ levels. People are dying already from the effects of global warming.” “This is climate murder, and so long as we chase after burning yet more fossil fuels, we are complicit. I’ve done everything ‘acceptable’ that I can do personally to combat climate change, but our problems are systemic. What more can I do? I’m marching with Just Stop Oil to force the issue to the forefront of the news agenda.” This morning’s marches follow the introduction of new police powers on Tuesday that reclassify ‘major disruption’ as anything more than ‘minor’. This effectively bans the right to march in the street, a cornerstone of liberal democracy that has been fundamental to every progressive development for centuries.

"191","Open letter to Good Morning Britain",2023-06-14,"Dear Daniel, Susanna, Richard, Ben and Charlotte, I was booked by your producer, Patrick, to appear in the Studio this morning for your discussion on whether Just Stop Oil should be made to pay for its own policing. After making a series of plans for my kids to be looked after in my absence overnight, and on the verge of getting on a train to London, I was cancelled. It turned out you had scored Dale Vince, who whilst being a brilliant man and a valued and vocal supporter of Just Stop Oil, is not a spokesperson for our group.  So you proceeded this morning with a story about us, without us. The editorial bias of your programme, evident now for many months, is a disgrace to you as journalists and a betrayal of your viewers.  As public broadcasters, you are responsible for shaping how the public think about key issues.  And you’ve certainly shaped this one.  Of course 80% of GMB viewers agree with you that Just Stop Oil should be made to pay for the policing of their protests: every single time we’ve been mentioned on your programme you’ve othered us, smeared us, mocked and belittled us.  The occasional violence that protesters experience on the roads is legitimised and perhaps even encouraged by the unbalanced and contemptuous attacks on Just Stop Oil supporters which are repeated by you and your guests, like Peter Bleksley who I was on with two weeks ago. This circular conversation about Just Stop Oil’s tactics has to stop.  We need to be talking about WHY we’re protesting, not HOW.  Why is it that a group of ordinary people – doctors, teachers, social workers, plumbers, electricians, mums, grandparents and more – who have previously been upstanding and law-abiding citizens are putting themselves and their reputations on the line?  Do you really believe it’s because they like annoying people and spending time in prison cells?  Or do you think it might be something else? I don’t believe that any one of you has read the IPCC’s 6th Report.  If you had, we’d be having a more grown-up conversation.  We’ve read it.  And we’ve listened when Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the UN, says that we’re on ‘a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator’.  When he says this is ‘Code Red for Humanity’. When he calls the report ‘an atlas of human suffering’.  When he says that whilst climate activists are often depicted as dangerous extremists, the real extremists are the governments and multi-nationals who are expanding fossil fuel extraction when we know that it is killing us. So, you could read the most important report that has ever been published in the history of humanity, and you could start framing the debate around that.  Or you could look out of the window.  Canada is on fire: the smoke drifting south is suffocating New York.  Farmers in places as disparate as Spain and India are walking away from their crops this year: there is either no moisture in the ground for them to grow, or they are inundated with flood water.  Flash flooding is destroying homes in this country this week.  And this year will be the hottest on record: 60 UK families saw their homes go up in smoke last year – how many this year? You have chosen to present us as the enemies of ordinary people – yet it is ordinary people who are suffering first and worst from this crisis, here in the UK and around the world.  It is ordinary people who will not be able to afford food when crops fail and shortages bite.  Ordinary people who can’t pay their energy bills while CEOs like Darren Woods of Exxon pocket $24m every year (plus bonuses).  We are the ones whose homes and livelihoods are at immediate risk. And we are the ones who will suffer when law and order breaks down – as it will, because the climate crisis is the biggest threat to our civilisation that has ever been faced.  What happens when it’s not loo roll we’re fighting over in the supermarket aisles, but food?  And what will happen when ordinary people realise the extent to which they have been betrayed by their governments and by the journalists and editors who have chosen to waffle on about tactics and the cost of policing whilst ignoring the nightmare which is steaming down the tracks towards us? How safe do you think you will be in your homes then? Our government needs calling to account.  If you won’t do it, we will.  You challenged Dale Vince on the money that he has donated over several years to Labour, and he made it very clear that he is not expecting to influence any policy in return for those funds.  Why aren’t you challenging the Government on the £3.5m they received from fossil fuel lobbyists just last year, and asking them whether that has anything to do with the 100 new fossil fuel licenses that they are seeking to issue?  Where is the balance?  Where is the editorial justification for ignoring massive problems while focusing on tiny details somewhere else?  Where is the truth? And why are you continuing to illustrate stories about Just Stop Oil with images of us on the streets, frequently selecting those clips which show us being assaulted by police officers and members of the public?  Why aren’t you showing the support we’re receiving?  And, more importantly, why aren’t you showing images of the environmental and humanitarian degradation which is resulting from the fossil fuel use that we are standing up against? You need to do better.  You need to facilitate balanced, reasoned, calm-headed discussion around these issues.  Stop putting us up against ex-coppers who have nothing new to say.  Start putting us on with climate scientists who will express their gratitude for the work that we are doing to amplify their evidence and data.  Put us on with people who are on the frontline of this crisis and are suffering now. Give us more than 5 minutes to discuss this in a way that respects the intelligence of your audience – it is no less than they deserve. The parties to the Paris Agreement in 2015, which includes the UK Government, not only agreed to use their best endeavours to limit annual average global heating to 1.5 degrees above the pre-Industrial average, they committed to communicating with their citizens about the facts of the climate crisis and the extent to which we are all at risk.  Our Government has not kept its promises towards the former, and is not even trying to do the latter.  Our unelected Prime Minister cannot even make the climate crisis one of his top five priorities, despite it driving almost all of the problems he is seeking to address and being the biggest threat to his precious economy.  Until the Government steps up, and until you journalists hold their feet to the fire, our presence is essential, and we will not give up. Do better.  For your kids, for my kids, for all of us. Chloe Naldrett Fully-employed working mother of two sons and volunteer Just Stop Oil spokesperson, Bristol Follow us on social media. Just Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK. In 2022 we started taking action to demand the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects. We have won on this . Civil resistance works. Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030. Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition. This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.

"192","Just Stop Oil supporters unlawfully arrested after new ban on right to dissent",2023-06-14,"Just Stop Oil supporters are once again marching in their eighth week of daily action in the capital to demand that the UK Government halt all licences and consents for new oil, gas and coal projects. [1] At around 8am, 68 Just Stop Oil supporters, in five groups, began marching on roads around West London including the Westway and Cromwell Road, and near the Chiswick roundabout. Two supporters were arrested at around 8:20 am for walking on the A205 near Chiswick roundabout. Another supporter was unlawfully arrested on Cromwell Road after police did not appropriately issue a Public Order Act (Section 12) notice. The arrests come following an important vote on new public order regulations in the House of Lords last night. At the end of April, the government introduced new Public Order regulations which redefined the meaning of “serious disruption” in the Public Order Act to mean anything more than minor. An attempt to strike down these regulations was defeated in the House of Lords last night. [2][3] One of those on the road this morning, Eddie Francis, 74, a retired joiner from Lincoln said: “I’m terrified of a collapsing society because of the climate crisis, we’re experiencing crop failure already. I feel I have to stand up and take action to get the government to stop new oil, gas and coal, because I can see, right now, that it’s presiding over a disaster.” Another of those on the road this morning, Rachel White, 52, a former NHS Health professional from Rochford, said: “I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I have tried writing to MPs and signing petitions, I even walked 500 miles from London to Glasgow to COP26 to try and raise awareness, but our government is still issuing new gas and oil licences. This is a death sentence for millions. Canada is on fire, the Arctic is melting at a rapid rate, Europe is already reaching record temperatures, but this is hardly reported by the media.” “If my grandchildren are to have a liveable climate, all new gas and oil must stop. What other choice do I have other than to take action? There is no other choice now, as it is clear the government will carry on business as usual unless everyday people like me demand otherwise.” Today’s marches come against a backdrop of increasingly extreme weather events in the UK. Flash flooding has hit parts of the country. Patients were urged to  stay away from the A&E department in Luton, due to flooding. Meanwhile, drivers on the M1 found parts of the road submerged. [4] Just Stop Oil supporters have completed up to seven marches a day, six days a week since the 24th April –  a total of 114 marches. Around 600 ordinary people from all over the UK have taken part. To date there have been 98 arrests and 40 people have been charged with failure to comply with public order act (section 12) conditions. Since the Just Stop Oil campaign launched on 14th February 2022, there have been 2,200 arrests and 138 people have spent time in prison, many without trial. There are currently two Just Stop Oil supporters serving three year prison sentences for resisting new oil, gas and coal. We stand with these political prisoners, with the 1,800 victims of the UK’s broken criminal justice system, imprisoned for over a year without trial, and with the 1,700 murdered across the global south, for protecting all our lives. Ordinary people must come together to resist this criminal government and hold them to account for their genocidal policies.
