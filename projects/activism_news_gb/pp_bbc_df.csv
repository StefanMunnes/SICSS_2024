"Just Stop Oil activists get conditional bail","By Shivani Chaudhari",2024-07-04,"Police investigating an incident in which private jets were sprayed with orange paint by Just Stop Oil activists have released two women on bail. Jennifer Kowalski, 28, from Dumbarton, and Cole Macdonald, 22, from Brighton, were arrested after angle grinders were used to break through fencing at Stansted Airport at about 05:00 BST on 5 June. Both women deny charges of criminal damage, aggravated trespass and interfering with national infrastructure. They were granted conditional bail and released from HMP Peterborough on Wednesday. Just Stop Oil had said the private jet of popstar Taylor Swift was targeted at the Essex airport, but police said it was not there at the time. Two private aircraft on a taxiway were sprayed with fire extinguishers loaded with orange paint during the incident, police said. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court had previously heard 75 flights were disrupted during a 38-minute delay, affecting thousands of passengers. The pair were originally denied bail and were due to appear for another hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court on 22 July. Follow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

"Just Stop Oil pair sentenced for snooker protest","By Oli Constable",2024-07-10,"A Just Stop Oil protester who jumped onto a snooker table and covered it in orange powder during the World Snooker Championship has been given an 18-month community order. Edred Whittingham, 26, disrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on 17 April 2023, with an international TV audience witnessing the protest. On Wednesday at Sheffield Magistrates' Court, he was also told to pay £899 in compensation for damaging the table and asked to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Whittingham, of Exeter, denied a criminal damage charge but was found guilty after a one-day trial in May. Co-defendant Margaret Reid, 53, from Kendal, in Cumbria, was given a two-year community order and told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work after being found guilty of attempting to cause criminal damage on another table. Completion of the first-round match was delayed until the following day as a result of the protest, with Whittingham throwing dyed corn starch powder. Reid's attempts to disrupt the match on the other table, on which Mark Allen and Fan Zhengyi were playing, were foiled when she was stopped by referee Olivier Marteel. District Judge Daniel Curtis told the pair prison was ""almost inevitable"" if they continued their criminal activities. Spectators were ""robbed"" of entertainment when the matches were stopped, World Snooker Tour chief executive officer Simon Brownell said in a victim impact statement read to court. ""They bought a ticket to our event and gave their best effort to destroy it, without a care in the world for the thousands of people who saved their money to attend,"" he said. Security costs had increased by ""hundreds of thousands of pounds"" following the incident, he added. In mitigation for Whittingham, the court heard the type of substance was selected ""not to cause maximum damage but simply to have a visual effect as part of the protest"". Representing herself in court, Reid said: ""I'm a pretty boring middle-aged person that, like a lot of people, tries to do their best - it would have been much easier to stay at home and pretend my little community was going to be fine."" Sentencing the pair to community orders, Judge Curtis said some people ""will be highly critical"" of not sending them to prison, adding he had to apply the sentencing guidelines. Outside court, Whittingham told the BBC he would continue protesting, adding: ""We're facing a climate crisis. ""Prison time, community service, it's not going to deter us."" Whittingham was also told to carry out a 25-day rehabilitation order along with paying £390 in trial costs. Reid was given a 10-day rehabilitation order, told to pay £390 trial costs and handed a £114 victim surcharge. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

"Two cleared over Just Stop Oil rugby final protest",NA,2024-06-25,"Two Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters who invaded the pitch at Twickenham during a rugby final have been cleared of criminal damage. Samuel Johnson, 41, a construction worker from Essex, and Patrick Hart, 38, a GP from Bristol, threw orange powder during the Gallagher Premiership final between Saracens and Sale in May 2023. They were acquitted by a jury at Kingston Crown Court on Tuesday. The pair still face a charge of aggravated trespass, which has been sent back to Wimbledon Magistrates' Court to be dealt with at a later date. JSO said prosecutors struggled to prove that the two men had intended to cause criminal damage, because they would not have realised how difficult it would be to clean the powder paint from the Twickenham pitch. Similar paint was thrown by activists during the Ashes at Lord's and was easily cleaned up with a leaf blower, but the hybrid pitch at Twickenham is a combination of natural and plastic grass and much more difficult to clean. Mr Johnson said: ""I took part in this action because our politicians continue to issue licences, knowing full well it will result in the deaths of millions of people. “Thousands have died due to extreme heat brought on by climate change while we were on trial. ""This is happening now.” Dr Hart said: “I told the jury that I am taking the most effective action I can, on the best available evidence, to protect the health of my patients. ""To put it simply: I am doing my duty as a doctor.” The Crown Prosecution Service said it respected the jury's decision.

"Stonehenge covered in powder paint by Just Stop Oil","By Leigh Boobyer",2024-06-19,"Part of Stonehenge has been covered in orange powder paint by protesters. Two Just Stop Oil campaigners sprayed the powder paint on the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday. The move comes the day before celebrations begin for the Summer Solstice at the 5,000-year-old landmark. Wiltshire Police confirmed two people had been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. Just Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and it would ""wash away with rain"". The group named the two protesters as Niamh Lynch, a 21-year-old student from Oxford, and Rajan Naidu, a 73-year-old from Birmingham, in a statement. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the incident as a “disgraceful act of vandalism”. Leader of the Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer said the damage was ""outrageous"" and described Just Stop Oil as ""pathetic"". Members of the public were heard shouting ""no"" and seen running to intervene as the campaigners ran up to the stone circle at the Unesco world heritage site. Nick Merriman, chief executive of English Heritage, said the vandalism was ""deeply saddening"". He told the BBC's Today programme the stones are ""testament to people's desire to connect to nature"", and while he respected the rights of people to protest, he hoped they would channel their activism away from museum sites in future.  BBC correspondent, Paul Clifton, the first reporter to get to the scene shortly after the incident, said the three stones closest to the public path were ""splattered"" with the powder. He added that many of the tourists visiting the monument were ""slightly bemused"". ""Stonehenge managers and security guards are standing by the path,"" he said. ""I've heard a suggestion that because it is powder paint and the weather is dry and sunny, it may perhaps be removed without lasting damage, but they will need experts to inspect the stone before forming an opinion."" Just Stop Oil said the motivation behind the incident was to demand the next UK government end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. A spokesperson for the group said: ""Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. ""We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything."" Mark Verbinnen, councillor for Amesbury East and Bulford, arrived at the site a few minutes after the incident. He said many members of staff at the site were left ""shaken"", particularly one who attempted to tackle a protester. Mike Pitts, archaeologist and author of How to Build Stonehenge, said the impact of the action was ""potentially quite concerning"". He said: “The monument has been fenced off for decades and the megaliths' surfaces are protected. ""They are sensitive and they are completely covered in prehistoric markings which remain to be fully studied and any surface damage to the stones is hugely concerning. “A rich garden of life has grown on the megaliths, an exceptional lichen garden has grown. So it’s potentially quite concerning.” The orange powder was removed from the stones using blown air, which has helped preserve the rare lichen on the surface of the stones, Mr Merriman confirmed. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ""We responded to a report that orange paint had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects. ""Our enquiries are ongoing and we are working closely with English Heritage.""  Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"Silverstone track invaders await appeal ruling","By Martin Heath and PA Media",2024-06-27,"Five Just Stop Oil activists who disrupted the 2022 British Grand Prix must wait to discover if they have successfully challenged their public nuisance convictions. Three of the protesters got onto the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire during the race. At an appeal hearing on Wednesday, the group's lawyers argued their convictions were ""unsafe"". Three appeal court judges will give a written ruling at a later date. Alasdair Gibson, Louis McKechnie, David Baldwin, Emily Brocklebank and Joshua Smith were convicted at Northampton Crown Court last year of risking ""serious harm"" to drivers and race marshals during the track invasion. They had all denied causing a public nuisance and argued they had followed a ""meticulous"" safety plan. McKechnie, 23, and Brocklebank, 26, have previous convictions for gluing themselves to the frame of a £70m Van Gogh painting days before the F1 protest. They were given suspended prison sentences of 12 months and six months respectively, both suspended for two years. Baldwin, who is 48, Gibson, 23, and Smith, 30, were handed 12-month community orders. At the appeal hearing, the group's lawyers argued their convictions were ""unsafe"". The protesters' lawyers argued that only a ""handful"" of individuals were potentially put at risk by their actions, which did not amount to an impact on ""a section of the public"" as required by the relatively-new public nuisance offence. Nadesh Karu, representing Smith and Brocklebank, said Silverstone's Wellington Straight, where the track invasion took place, was not open to the public. He added that prosecutors accepted the 115,000 spectators were not at risk of serious harm. Simon Jones, for the Crown Prosecution Service, told the court: ""From the moment each individual jumped the first fence, they were going into a dangerous prohibited area,"" he said. ""There were clearly sections of the public who were at risk."" Brocklebank, of Yeadon, Leeds, Gibson, from Aberdeen, McKechnie, from Manchester, and Smith, from Oldham, went on to the race circuit during the protest. Baldwin, from Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, the only member of the five to attend court, was found in a car park along with glue, cable ties and a Just Stop Oil banner. Lord Justice Holroyde said appeal judges needed to reflect on legal arguments, adding that the cases took the court into ""new territory"". Follow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

"Dozens of campaigners held over alleged airport plans",NA,2024-06-28,"Dozens of Just Stop Oil supporters suspected of planning to disrupt airports this summer have been arrested across England. The Metropolitan Police said 27 people were taken into custody, including some believed to be ""key organisers"" for the climate group. Six arrests were made in east London, four at Gatwick airport, and the rest from forces across the country. The force added the six who were arrested on Thursday evening at a community centre in London were there ""as part of a publicly-advertised event promoting airport disruption"". The operation took place in Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Devon, Essex, Manchester, Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk and West Yorkshire, a Met spokesperson said. The 27 were detained under the Public Order Act which makes it illegal to conspire to disrupt national infrastructure. Four people arrested on Tuesday after being identified at Gatwick Airport and have since been released on bail.  Ch Supt Ian Howells added: “We know Just Stop Oil are planning to disrupt airports across the country this summer which is why we have taken swift and robust action now. ""Our stance is very clear that anyone who compromises the safety and security of airports in London can expect a strong response from officers or security staff. ""Airports are complex operating environments which is why we are working closely with them, agencies and other partners on this operation."" Suspects released on bail are subject to conditions which include not travelling within one kilometre of any UK airport unless passing by while on a mode of transport. In response to the wave of arrests, a Just Stop Oil spokesman said: ""It isn’t a massive surprise."" He added that disruption is necessary because people are ""dropping dead around the world"" from extreme heat, and ""tipping points"" are being passed.

"Heathrow Airport granted court order against protests","By James W Kelly & PA Media",2024-07-09,"Heathrow Airport has been granted a High Court injunction against potential environmental protesters on the site. On Tuesday, lawyers for the airport appeared before a judge in London to ask for an order preventing demonstrators from trespassing on the site. Katharine Holland KC, for the airport, told the court that the site was a ""clear and obvious target for planned disruptive action"" by protesters affiliated with Just Stop Oil and ""other environmental campaigns"". It follows two Just Stop Oil activists being arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after appearing to spray orange paint over private jets at Stansted Airport. Ms Holland said Heathrow Airport was featured in a video published on the Just Stop Oil website, which represented ""the identification of a specific threat to this location"". The court was told that the airport - Europe's busiest - handles more than 1,300 flights and about 227,000 passengers on average daily, with the actions of potential protesters risking ""significant"" harm. In written submissions, Ms Holland continued: ""There would also be severe disruption to passengers, and the proper operations of the airport more generally."" At the end of the hearing, Mr Justice Julian Knowles granted the injunction, which lasts for five years and will be reviewed every 12 months. He said: ""If these protesters want to stand on public land near the entrances to Heathrow Airport then they can do. ""What they can't do is go on to private land and do it."" Following the hearing, a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said: ""We agree that aviation must decarbonise, however disrupting people's well-earned travel plans with irresponsible action is not the way to deliver the transition to net zero. ""This isn't a decision we've taken lightly, but we cannot condone activity that endangers the safety of our passengers and colleagues."" The move comes days after Stansted, Manchester and East Midlands airports were given similar injunctions against would-be protesters.

"Third arrest after Stonehenge sprayed with powder paint","By Emma Grimshaw & PA Media",2024-06-29,"A third person has been arrested in connection with a Just Stop Oil protest in which part of Stonehenge was covered in orange powder paint. Campaigners sprayed the substance on the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday 19 June. A man aged in his 30s, from Essex, was detained by Met Police officers on Thursday. He has been arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting criminal damage, aiding and abetting unauthorised entry and damage to an ancient monument, and aiding and abetting aggravated trespass. He has been released on bail. Two other people, a man in his 70s and a woman in her 20s, were previously arrested in connection with the incident. They remain on bail. Following the protest, English Heritage said experts had quickly removed the orange powder from the stones. It confirmed there appeared to be no visible damage from the paint but the act of removing it could erode the fragile stone and damage the lichens. Just Stop Oil said the motivation behind the incident was to demand the next UK government end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.

"'Slow-walk' protests banned at 1,200 locations","By Tom Wall and Josephine Casserly",2024-07-02,"The scale of efforts by oil companies and public bodies to protect their premises from environmental protesters can be revealed in new BBC analysis. More than 400 demonstrators are named in court orders that restrict protests at more than 1,200 locations, the data gathered by File on 4 shows. The civil injunctions - in force at places like oil terminals, petrol stations and racetracks across England and Wales - also apply to “persons unknown”, meaning anyone could be prosecuted. The enforcement of civil injunctions has been reported before, but our analysis is the first time the extent of their use has been calculated. Oil companies and public bodies say the orders are needed to prevent disruptive and dangerous protests. But a lawyer acting for protesters says they are unfair and amount to a “privatised system of justice”. Raj Chada, the head of criminal law at Hodge Jones and Allen, has told us his firm had no injunction cases until 2021, but it is now representing close to 80 individuals. “There was the odd case previously, but the scope and number of [protest] injunctions is now unprecedented,” he says. Listen on BBC Sounds now, or on Radio 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday 2 July and 11:00 on Wednesday 3 July The anti-protest injunctions limit what people can do, who they can associate with and where they can go. The punishment for breaching one can be up to two years imprisonment or an unlimited fine - a heavier penalty than for equivalent offences in criminal law. Eight have been taken out by oil companies including Shell, Esso and ExxonMobil. National Highways and Transport for London account for five more - and the other two were taken out by local councils (one by North Warwickshire and a joint injunction by Essex and Thurrock). These organisations argue the measures are needed to deter protesters, because police can only act after an offence has been committed. However, lawyers acting for the protesters argue that civil injunction proceedings lack some of the safeguards of the criminal system. A civil injunction application can be made without the knowledge of the defendant or any representation in court. Once an order is granted, attempts should be made to inform those named - including putting up signs, sending emails to protest groups and serving papers on individuals in their homes. Few applications to the High Court are challenged because legal aid is not available for the initial hearing, says lawyer Raj Chada. Protesters can argue their case at a second hearing, but must abide by the injunction's rules until then. Breaching an injunction is not technically a criminal offence - however, local authorities can apply for special powers to give police the power of arrest. Sarah Benn, a retired GP from Birmingham, was imprisoned for 32 days in 2022 for repeatedly breaching an injunction preventing protests near Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire, the largest inland oil storage depot in the UK. Her breach consisted of protesting on a grass verge and sitting on the private road leading into the terminal. “They could easily have… arrested us for obstruction of the highway,” she says, “but because [we had] breached the High Court injunction we all went to prison.” Benn was one of 10 people given custodial sentences for breaching the injunction three or more times. Fifty-one people spent time in prison on remand after being arrested for breaking the injunction.  North Warwickshire Borough Council - which took out the injunction - has declined to comment as it is applying to the High Court to renew the measure for three more years. However, court documents filed by the council’s lawyers claim the actions of the protesters, which included entering the site and climbing oil storage tanks, could have led to an explosion affecting the entire area. Oil companies on the Kingsbury site have declined to comment. Valero Energy, which operates out of the terminal, has a separate anti-protest injunction in place. A Freedom of Information request submitted by the BBC shows North Warwickshire council officers met oil company representatives 10 times, partly in relation to obtaining the injunction. The council does not hold minutes of the meetings. The request also reveals the council spent £155,000 on legal fees in the process. Lawyer Raj Chada argues the proliferation of injunctions amounts to “private justice” - only available to those who can afford to pay. Protesters risk being ordered to pay their opponents’ legal bills if they make an unsuccessful challenge to the injunction, he says. “[This} can run to hundreds of thousands of pounds.” The environmental group, Friends of the Earth, is now taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights, challenging the use of anti-protest injunctions in the UK. File on 4 has contacted the other organisations to have successfully applied for civil injunctions. National Highways says it is unable to comment due to the general election, but it has previously said it sought injunctions to deter extremely dangerous and reckless protests on motorways. Transport for London says it took out injunctions to ensure London’s road network could operate safely and that emergency service vehicles could move freely through the city. Essex County Council and Thurrock Council say their injunction does not restrict anyone’s right to carry out lawful protest. “It simply seeks to stop protestors from unlawfully blocking or damaging the public highway as part of that protest,” says a spokesperson. Shell says the injunctions are not about preventing freedom of expression but preventing “unlawful and dangerous protests”. Esso and ExxonMobil told us they were unable to comment on active litigation matters. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Women deny £52k spray paint damage to private jets","By Alex Pope  & PA Media",2024-06-22,"Two women have denied causing £52,000 worth of damage after private jets were sprayed with orange paint by Just Stop Oil activists at Stansted Airport.

"Youth club forced to shut after 'senseless' vandalism","By Katie Waple",2024-07-13,"A charity that runs youth clubs for 11 to 18-year-olds has been forced to stop its services after its centre was vandalised. Vision 4 Youth in Yateley, Hampshire, said a ""small group broke in and covered the place in cooking oil, eggs and rubbish"" last weekend. The organisation, which works to support 160 young people each week, is fundraising to help pay for the clear-up so it can reopen. Abby Roper, development manager at Vision 4 Youth, said vandals had left the site ""a complete mess and it was totally senseless"". She said: ""Nothing was stolen, but vandals got hold of cooking equipment, oil and eggs - they've just thrown it around, it's everywhere - the walls, the floor, the games, our TV - everything is covered. ""We have had to close this week - we usually support 160 people so we've had to turn them all away. ""The place is not safe - it's so slippery in there it's like a skating rink."" Ms Roper added: ""It's so bad we are having to have it professionally cleaned and then we will have to repaint and replace our equipment."" The charity has so far raised about £1,000.

"PCC to be quizzed over 'security lapse' at Duke's wedding","By Belinda Ryan",2024-07-16,"A police commissioner will be asked to look into an ""unacceptable security lapse"" that enabled protesters to disrupt the Duke and Duchess of Westminster's wedding, which was attended by the Prince of Wales. Just Stop Oil protesters sprayed orange powder from a fire extinguisher, stopping the wedding party as they left Chester Cathedral last month. At a meeting on Friday Cheshire police and crime commissioner Dan Price will be asked to explain how this happened. The panel will also ask the full cost to the force of policing the event, which was also supported by neighbouring forces. In a written question already submitted to the commissioner, the county's police and crime panel has asked if an investigation has been carried out into the ""lapse in security which led to the offence where protesters managed to expel two fire extinguishers"". The question goes on to ask if there has been an ""acceptance that this situation was an unacceptable security lapse which could have resulted in a much worse and more dangerous outcome"" for the police officers, wedding guests and to the wider public. The commissioner will also be asked about costs involved in the policing operation ""given the continued very challenging fiscal situation faced by Cheshire Police"".

"Worker dies at plant owned by Gething donor firm","By Jack Grey",2024-07-09,"A worker has been killed at a recycling site owned by a firm that gave £200,000 to Vaughan Gething's Welsh Labour leadership campaign. Emergency crews were called to the Atlantic Recycling plant in Rumney, Cardiff, on Monday at 12:45 BST, South Wales Police said. The man died of his injuries, police added, and his family had been informed. The firm's parent company, Dauson Environmental Group, said it involved a ""contractor carrying out maintenance"" at the site. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been informed and an investigation is ongoing, the force said. Det Sgt Richard Hill, from South Wales Police, said: “We would like to offer our condolences to the family of the man who sadly lost his life. ""Our aim now, together with the Health and Safety Executive, is to carry out a robust investigation and establish the cause of this tragic incident.” Dauson said in a statement: ""We are continuing to support the emergency services and regulators with their ongoing investigations at this time."" The company's £200,000 donation to Welsh Labour leadership candidate Vaughan Gething became controversial when it was revealed its director David John Neal, was previously prosecuted for environmental offences in 2013 and 2017. The first minister said he broke no rules, but lost a vote of no confidence in the Senedd last month over the issue. Atlantic Recycling admitted a health and safety breach in the death of a worker in January and was fined £300,000. Anthony Bilton, 59, was run over by a shovel loader at the firm's site in Rumney in September 2019. An HSE investigation into that incident found an improper risk assessment had been done.

English Heritage chief executive, Dr Nick Merriman, said there appeared to be ""no visible damage"" to the 5,000-year-old landmark after experts cleaned the site. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Merriman also confirmed the site would be open for summer solstice celebrations as normal from 19:00 BST on Thursday. Wiltshire Police said the two protesters were released on bail ""to allow us additional time to work with specialists and progress our enquiries"". They had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity. English Heritage said the orange paint had been removed using a ""specialist handheld blower"". It told the BBC that if rain had come into contact with the powder, damage could have been significant. The stones are covered in more than fifty different lichens, some of them rare. This meant brushing or washing the paint off was not possible. An English Heritage spokesperson said: “We can’t understand why anyone who professes to care for the environment would attempt to harm such a monument and to distress people from all over the world, including those for whom Stonehenge holds a spiritual significance.” Dr Merriman said: ""It's difficult to understand and we're deeply saddened about this vandalism, but we've been really touched by the messages of sympathy and support we've had. ""Our experts have already managed to clean the orange powder from the stones because we were really worried about what would happen if they got in contact with water. ""So far, there seems to be no visible damage. The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow."" Dr Merriman called the act ""vandalism to one of the world's most celebrated ancient monuments"". He added: ""We wish people would channel their protests away from cultural heritage sites, museums and galleries because we feel that doesn't actually help their cause, and causes huge upset and disruption to the operation of these important sites."" The demonstration had been condemned by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer. Just Stop Oil said its motivation was to demand the next UK government to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. The group said the orange powder paint was cornflour and would ""wash away with rain"". It named the two protesters as Niamh Lynch, a 21-year-old student from Oxford, and Rajan Naidu, a 73-year-old from Birmingham, in a statement.

"Two women charged after jets sprayed with paint","By Danny Fullbrook & PA Media",2024-06-21,"Two women have been charged after private jets were sprayed with orange paint by Just Stop Oil activists at Stansted Airport. Jennifer Kowalski, 28, and Cole Macdonald, 22, are accused of causing more than £5,000-worth of damage. Essex Police said Macdonald, of Baker Street, Brighton, and Kowalski, of Williamson Avenue, Dumbarton, have been charged with criminal damage, aggravated trespass and interfering with national infrastructure. Both women are due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Saturday. The force confirmed the private jet of pop star Taylor Swift, which Just Stop Oil said had landed at Stansted ""mere hours before"", was not at the airport at the time. Activists entered the airfield and painted two private jets using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint, the environmental group said. Police said said two people were arrested within nine minutes of them being called to the airport at 05:10 BST on Thursday. Ch Supt Simon Anslow said: ""I would like to reassure passengers and the wider public that we are well prepared and resourced to deal with incidents of this nature.

"Newspaper headlines: 'Slip N Slide incident' and Stonehenge drama",NA,2024-06-22,"Headlines on local websites and newspapers in the West of England have been dominated by a mixture of Glastonbury Festival news and Stonehenge. Earlier in the week, Bristol Live's network content editor Steven Smith reported on the Just Stop Oil campaigners spraying Stonehenge with an orange paint. He explained how members of the public tried to intervene during the incident near Salisbury on Wednesday - the day before the Summer Solstice. The Swindon Advertiser also covered this and a day later wrote an article on the successful removal of the paint. It said a ""specialist handheld blower"" was used to clean the orange cornflour paint from the ancient monument. Early Friday morning brought a flurry of photographs from news outlets across the west on the summer solstice celebrations, where around 15,000 gathered at Stonehenge to watch the sunrise. The Wiltshire Times reported King Arthur Pendragon, a senior druid and pagan priest, had disapproved of the action earlier in the week. But explained this did not diminish the celebrations for those attending which he said included people from “every single continent”. The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald reported a group of people dressed as Mexican mushrooms took nine days to travel to the site. With only a handful of days to go until the gates of Glastonbury Festival open to revellers, Somerset Live kept a close eye on all of the weather reports. Content editor Daniel Clark reported on Great Western Railway revealing its 'Shania Train' ahead of the event. The new train will be used to drop off some of the thousands of festival-goers set to descend upon Castle Cary station next week. The Somerset Gazette, shared a special ""star filled"" photograph"" inspired by the festival's Pyramid Stage. In other news, a special tribute film for Wilf 'the egg man' Peddle' made by Tor Theatre was shared on the Normal For Glastonbury, Facebook page. Somerset Live, reported an air ambulance airlifted a boy to hospital after he got injured at the Slip N Slide attraction in Frome. Bristol Live, published an article on the latest in the Bristol Downs van dwellers saga where caravans and vehicles parked on the beauty spot were told to leave within the next two weeks. A post on the Weston-super-Mare in the Spotlight Facebook group gainied attention earlier this week when a resident reported seeing poeple walking all over the town's floral clock mural. The clock had been restored after being concreted over in February. Volunteers from Weston Lions Club have been responsible for looking after the clock for the last decade. Do you remember when that lorry that hit the M5 Gantry? The lorry driver was found guilty of dangerous driving this week and Burnham-on-sea.com re-shared the shocking footage. Anthony Baker, 48, had denied the charge, but was convicted by a jury after a two-day trial at Bristol Crown Court. Finally, a fun day of dressing up in Victorian clothes was had by Chalford Hill Primary School pupils in Stroud this week. The school was celebrating its 150th birthday. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?","By Kevin Keane",2024-06-27,"""Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?"" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of ""unlicenced"" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels. Environmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit. Nowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had ""just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs"" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs. The Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs ""at risk"" is 27,000  across the whole UK, not just Scotland. The industry argues that more investment in future oil and gas production will directly affect the total number of jobs which can be created in green industries, like hydrogen and wind, because it keeps supply chains going. The most optimistic forecast from RGU suggested there could be 104,000 jobs in UK renewables by 2030 – but it said this could be as low as 36,000 if there was low investment. Offshore Energies UK says the sector is ready to invest £450bn in the UK economy by 2040 with support from government. The industry says it can scale up the supply chain capacity, sustain skilled jobs and deliver energy security - all while delivering on climate goals. But be in no doubt, that means allowing them to keep drilling for more oil. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"'Tory wipeout' and 'nothing sacred'",NA,2024-06-20,"The Guardian leads on Labour plans to close the gender pay gap. In an interview with the paper, Rachel Reeves says she'll make flexible working the norm if she breaks the ""last glass ceiling in politics"" and becomes the UK's first female chancellor. Noting that a woman has never been in charge of the nation's finances before, she tells the paper she she feels a ""big responsibility"" to solve inequality in the workplace ""once and for all."" ""Tory Wipeout"" is the headline in the Daily Telegraph. An opinion poll for the paper suggests both Rishi Sunak, and the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, are at risk of losing their seats at the election.  According to the analysis - by the research companies Savanta and Electoral Calculus - around three quarters of the cabinet could be voted out. Analysing the results of the poll, the Telegraph's associate editor, Gordon Rayner, says Kemi Badenoch could become the future of the Conservative party ""by default"" - as the only ""big beast"" in the cabinet left standing. The results of another, YouGov poll of 35,000 voters is the main story in the Times. The seat-by-seat analysis suggests Labour are on course to win the biggest majority of any party in a century - with the Conservatives haemorrhaging support to Reform and the Lib Dems. The Financial Times says the latest figures on inflation ""delivered a filip"" to the prime minister, as he seeks to ""turn around"" his party's election campaign. Hitting the two per cent target for the first time in three years marks what it calls a ""milestone for the economy."" The Sun calls it ""Rishi's reward"" - for fighting off crazy union pay demands in the NHS. The Daily Mirror says he deserves no credit - given so many households are still struggling to make ends meet. The Daily Mail reports that the Post Office has published on its website the full names and addresses of 555 sub-postmasters, wrongly accused of fraud in the Horizon IT scandal. The paper says it appears to have uncovered a ""staggering data breach"" - described by some of the victims as another ""betrayal."" The confidential list has now been taken down. The Post Office said it had begun an investigation. ""Is nothing sacred?"" the Mail asks, on its front page, after Just Stop Oil protestors sprayed the Stonehenge with orange paint. The paper says the stunt, by what it calls ""eco fanatics"", caused outrage on the eve of the summer solstice. ""Just lock them up"" is the headline in the Daily Express. The paper carries a comment piece by the home secretary, James Cleverly, who describes what happened as a ""reckless and idiotic assault on the fabric of our nation"" - by what he calls ""hemp-wearing hoodlums."" The Times reports on what it says is the first ever scientific experiment on one of the most talked about consequences of the coronavirus pandemic - the rise of working from home. The randomised trial, involving more than 16 hundred workers at a Chinese technology company, sought to establish whether work from home makes employees more productive - or gives the lazy an excuse to slack off. The conclusion: staff who are allowed to stay home for part of the week are no more efficient than those who stay in the office....but they are happier.

"Oil and gas expansion is growth opportunity say Reform",NA,2024-06-26,"Oil and gas expansion is Scotland's ""greatest growth opportunity"", Reform UK's chairman has claimed. The party's former leader Richard Tice accused the SNP of ""gross negligence"" regarding the sector, as he launched their Scottish manifesto in Grangemouth. Mr Tice said his party - predicted by some polls to be ahead of the Conservatives in voting share - were having success due to ""common sense"" policies and for ""telling it like it is"". The party's key policies include scrapping all net zero targets, curbing immigration and raising the personal allowance threshold on income tax to £20,000. Mr Tice, who stood down as leader to let Nigel Farage take over earlier this month,  reiterated his party's regular attacks on net zero and climate change targets. He said: ""I can’t think of another nation in the world blessed with huge reserves of energy treasure that says 'I’ll just leave it underground...' Net zero is the greatest act of negligence imposed on a country by its leaders."" Mr Tice, who is running to be MP in the Lincolnshire seat of Boston and Skegness, claimed that axing all net zero projects would provide around £30bn to spend elsewhere, although this figure referred to the UK as a whole and not just Scotland. He said outsourcing energy to the likes of France and Norway was ""absolute madness"", and that both the SNP and Labour were wanting to ""double down"" on it. The party is standing candidates in every Scottish seat. Mr Tice said the SNP was ""obsessed with the wrong issues"", citing gender reform and Brexit. He also said that although Brexit's opportunities had not taken effect, this was due to the Conservatives having ""betrayed us"" in their handling of leaving the European Union, and not Brexit itself. And on gender reform he claimed that parents were saying ""thank heavens someone is telling it like it is"". The party proposes to ban what it calls “transgender ideology” in primary and secondary schools. It says this would stop any gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping in schools. However, education is devolved to the Scottish parliament, so this proposal could not be implemented in Scotland by taking power power at Westminister. Mr Tice stated that the party's proposal to introduce considerable tax cuts for small businesses would help the rest of the country as well. These plans include introducing a corporation tax free allowance of £100k in profits and lifting the threshold when businesses have to be VAT registered to £150k from £90k. He said: ""You can’t tax your way out of a crisis – you can grow your way out. Focus on growth - a rising tide lifts all boats and then we all become prosperous."" He added that this would then create more revenue to be invested in public services. Mr Tice also said that his party's policies would help young people, and that he would like to see a ""proper debate"" on healthcare in the UK, although it would remain free. The chairman praised Mr Farage, saying he provided a ""turbo boost"" to Reform since taking over as leader. Elsewhere on the campaign trail, the parties have been asked about reports of  election betting. Five Conservatives, including three candidates, are being looked at by the Gambling Commission for betting on the date of the election. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has admitted he placed bets but said he did not break any rules. The commission is also investigating Suffolk Labour candidate Kevin Craig for betting on himself to lose. Scottish Labour said his behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"". Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton admitted he placed ""very small"" bets for a Lib Dem victory in two seats to show ""confidence in my friends"". SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, campaigning in Inverurie, said he was not aware of any party members being investigated for election bets. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Players to perform Hay Wain near Constable painting","By Lewis Adams",2024-07-15,"A theatre show based on one of John Constable's most famous paintings will be performed at the Bristol gallery where the artwork is being exhibited. The Colchester-based Packing Shed Theatre has created a performance celebrating The Hay Wain. The painting is based on Flatford Mill, in East Bergholt, Suffolk, which was owned by Constable's father. The theatre company's artistic director, Neil Jones, said the cast was ""itching"" to get on stage. Shows would be held at Bristol Museum and Art Gallery from 14 to 17 August, Mr Jones added. He said the performance had been devised for the painting's 200th anniversary in 2021. ""One of the biggest thrills for us when staging plays is having a unique opportunity to perform it in a space which gives the story extra meaning and relevance,"" Mr Jones said. ""When it comes to The Hay Wain, I don't think it gets much better than being in the same gallery where the painting is literally hanging on the wall."" Mr Jones said it would be a ""huge adventure"" that would help to raise the profile of the show, which has attracted interest from a number of West End producers. ""It's been a bit like being told we're getting the best Christmas present ever - but back in July,"" he added.

"Stonehenge solstice sunrise attracts 15,000 people","By Sophie Parker, Harriet Robinson, Dan O'Brien & Marie Lennon",2024-06-21,"About 15,000 people have gathered at Stonehenge to watch the summer solstice sunrise. It is one of the rare occasions people can get close to the stones at the historic site near Salisbury in Wiltshire. It went ahead as normal after Just Stop Oil protestors sprayed orange powder paint on the stones on Wednesday. English Heritage has removed the paint with a specialist air blower, but if rain had come into contact with it, there could have been significant damage. The charity's historic properties director Kate Logan said: ""I think all the people who attended solstice today were just really pleased to come and see the stones looking spectacular. The incident is behind us now. ""We're really thrilled with how the event has gone this year. We don't often get such a glorious sunrise but today we've been very lucky."" People come from all over the world to see the summer solstice at the 5,000 year old site. Tammy McCollam said she had travelled about 5,000 miles from Washington in the US specifically for the event. “It’s amazing. When I was able to touch the stones, it just felt so emotional, incredible. ""I just felt called to come, this is a bucket list trip.” The site opened on Thursday evening and there was a crowd for the sunset, with many staying throughout the night to watch the sunrise on Friday morning. The sounds of drumming and cheers from the crowd could be heard as the sun came up. Druids and other members of the pagan community gathered too, with the event a spiritual time for many. Carolyn Pare was one of the visitors and said: “There's a beautiful camaraderie and energy. It's a completely moving, spiritual experience to be here.” Wiltshire Police always has a presence at the event but after the Just Stop Oil protest, Deputy Chief Constable Craig Dibdin said they had immediately reviewed their plans with organisers and were happy with them. DCC Dibdin said it had been ""very safe"", with only been one arrest for a minor assault. ""It's been a really successful, good humoured event,"" he added. Other places in the West Country also attract solstice crowds, in particular at Avebury, also in Wiltshire, and Glastonbury Tor in Somerset. Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"Key oil project must count full climate impact - court","By Justin Rowlatt",2024-06-20,"The Supreme Court has ruled a local council should have considered the full climate impact of burning oil from new wells - a landmark decision which could put future UK oil and gas projects in question. Under planning law the assumption has always been that only the impacts from constructing the wells and not the use of the final oil products should be considered. The case brought against Surrey County Council by Sarah Finch, on behalf of campaigners could threaten new UK fossil fuels projects. The council said it believed at the time it had followed planning law.  The Supreme Court judges did not rule that Surrey County Council should reject the proposal for new oil wells but that it should have considered the downstream emissions. While this precedent for taking emissions from products like oil into account does not stop new drilling it is something companies will have to consider when looking at new projects. “I am absolutely over the moon to have won this important case,"" Sarah Finch told supporters. Today’s judgement relates to the Horse Hill oil well in Surrey. The site was given planning permission to expand its operations in 2019, a decision that was challenged by Ms Finch, on behalf of Weald Action Group. Lawyers acting for Ms Finch said that as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment the council should have considered not just the greenhouse gas emissions from building the wells but also burning any oil that was then used – known as downstream emissions. In a three-to-two majority the Supreme Court judges agreed. Summing up the case Lord Leggatt said it was “inevitable” that oil from the site will be burned, and the resulting greenhouse emissions were “straightforwardly results of the project” which should be considered. The six wells at Horse Hill are expected to produce 3.3 million tonnes of crude oil over the next 20 years. Burning that oil would produce over 10 million tonnes of CO2, the environmental campaigning organisation Friends of the Earth has estimated. Stephen Sanderson, the chief executive of UK oil and gas plc - the company behind the Horse Hill project said the court's ruling was ""perplexing"". But he added ""the company's focus over the past few years has shifted away from oil and gas and firmly towards ... hydrogen storage."" UK oil and gas plc said they will now work with Surrey County Council to amend its planning application, and that future production will fall below the levels at which an environmental assessment is required. Campaigners claim the judgement could also affect ongoing legal challenges of new projects in the UK including Rosebank oil field and the proposed coal mine in Whitehaven in Cumbria. ""Today’s groundbreaking ruling is a heavy blow for fossil fuel lobbyists,"" said Weald Action Group. ""The UK is already veering dangerously off track for meeting its legally binding carbon reduction targets, and its international pledge to reduce emissions by two-thirds by 2030,"" they added. Because the UK law on environmental assessments is based in part on European law the ruling could have impacts abroad as well, they say. Ms Finch’s victory ends a five-year legal battle on behalf of local residents, in which she was supported by environmental campaigners Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. Her challenge to the project was initially rejected in the High Court but when it went to the Appeal Court in 2021 the judges returned a split decision and Ms Finch then took her case to the Supreme Court last year. The Supreme Court judges did not rule that Surrey County Council should reject the proposal for new oil wells but should have considered the downstream emissions.

"Who should I vote for and what are the parties promising?","By the Visual Journalism team",2024-07-03,"Polls open in the UK general election on Thursday - have you decided which party will get your vote? If not, this guide offers a summary of where the main parties stand on the issues most important to voters, based on the promises they have made during the campaign. Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you. A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster.

A joint campaign between the departments of environment and infrastructure has placed a new emphasis on prevention and incident reporting. As well as offering advice for boat owners on the maintenance and management of leaks, the government has also stressed the legal consequences owners could face. Environment Minister Clare Barber said people must do all that could to ""protect the delicate balance between human activity and nature to prevent further damage"". Ms Barber said: ""Just one litre of oil, or fuel, can pollute over one million litres of water."" As the world's only entire nation to be classified as a UNESCO biosphere, the Manx government has a commitment to protect and enhance the island's environment. The campaign comes as authorities expect to see an increase in the number of residents and visitors using the island's harbours during the summer months. The campaign has seen a series of guidelines issued for harbour users, including recreational owners and the island's fishing fleet. It includes advice for managing engine leaks, directions for removing oil and how to alert the authorities in the event of pollution. Those breaking the rules could face a fine of up to £5,000. Infrastructure Minister Tim Crookall said it was ""crucial for every individual to play their part in preventing pollution and reporting incidents promptly"". ""With your help, we can find the source to stop the problem as quick as possible,"" he added. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

"BBC Lancashire election debate: Five things we learned","By Mike Stevens",2024-07-01,"Local politicians have clashed over the cost of living crisis, healthcare and immigration in the BBC Radio Lancashire Your Voice, Your Vote Election Debate. Ahead of the general election, representatives from the five main parties battled it out over the course of an hour. You've been submitting your questions as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote campaign and we put some of those questions to candidates from across Lancashire representing Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and Reform UK. So what did we learn? Maria Bennett from Preston works full time for the NHS. She says her income barely covers her bills and food. She asked the panellists what they're going to do to help people who are struggling with the cost of living. Reform UK's Dan Barker kicked off the debate by talking about his party's plan to raise the income tax threshold to £20,000 – claiming it would save the average person around £3,000 per year. Labour, on the other hand, ruled out increasing any of the main taxes. The party's Oliver Ryan pledged to invest in public services if Sir Keir Starmer became prime minister – saying the money would come from closing tax loopholes and ""changes"" to other taxes. Jack Lenox from the Green Party said the country is going through an ""inequality crisis"" and said his party would help alleviate this by increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour. Lib Dem John Potter said insulating homes would've helped to reduce energy costs and blamed Brexit for partially causing the crisis. Conservative Sara Britcliffe said the government had regularly put financial support in place for people and cited the pandemic as the main cause of the crisis. When challenged on whether Liz Truss helped, she jokingly said ""no comment"". Lisa Thwaite from Burnley said cuts to mental health services were at the forefront of her mind. She asked the panel what they would do to help people get better access to mental health support services. In a rare moment, all five parties agreed that more needs to be done when it comes to mental health support. Mr Lenox talked about his struggles with his mental health and said mental and physical health should be on a par. Mr Potter said  prevention was better than the cure and said the Lib Dems would put a mental health practitioner in every school. Ms Britcliffe – who also talked about her mental health issues – agreed and matched the pledge. While Mr Ryan added the NHS was ""on its knees"" – citing both funding and reform as the solutions, while Mr Barker said the NHS waiting list needed to be addressed. Andrew Smith from Lytham told the panel the issue he's most concerned about was climate change. He feels that ""so little is being done"" and asked what the parties would do to tackle climate change and improve the environment. Ms Britcliffe said the Conservatives wanted to tackle climate change in a ""practical way"" which ""doesn't hit voters in their pockets"". Mr Lenox said there was so much low-hanging fruit when it came to tackling climate change. When questioned on the party's plans regarding the future of nuclear energy – which would impact the 1,500 people employed at Heysham nuclear power stations – he said the Greens were ""pragmatists"". But Mr Barker disagreed: ""If you want to go for clean energy and you don't want nuclear, you cannot call that pragmatic."" Mr Potter pointed to his party's plans regarding tackling sewage in waterways – saying the current situation was ""just not right"". Mr Ryan said his party was the only one which was realistically able to enact green policies – and said they would pay for them with a tax on oil and gas companies. ""One of the biggest problems today is illegal immigration,"" says Dave Wilton-Brown from Heysham. He asked the panel what they'd do to reduce it. Mr Potter said the Liberal Democrats would introduce more safe routes for people to enter the country which – he claimed – would stop people arriving in small boats. Much of the debate was taken up discussing the government's plan to send some asylum seekers 4,000 miles away to Rwanda. Poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Voting: Who can I vote for in the general election? General election 2024: All BBC stories and analysis Your Voice, Your Vote: Tell us the issues that matter to you Mr Ryan said Labour would deal with people smugglers as terrorists. He said the Rwanda scheme was a ""complete waste of money"" and said they've sent more home secretaries to Rwanda than asylum seekers. Ms Britcliffe disagreed, she said the Rwanda scheme was working – adding that people have been detained and are ready to get on flights. Mr Barker said a hardline approach was needed adding that his party would return migrants to France. He said: ""If we end up in a row with the French, that's not a bad thing if it ends up sorting the problem out."" While Mr Lenox said one solution would be for the UK to have an asylum processing centre in France to deal with applications. Housing was last on the agenda - Richard de Prieelle from New Longton asked the panel how they were going to ensure more affordable houses are going to be built. Mr Ryan said his party would build 300,000 new homes every year. He said housing reform was being held-up by ""red tape"" and said Labour would free up some of the green belt to ease the issue. Mr Barker blamed a ""population explosion"" for high rents and a lack of housing capacity. Ms Britclifffe said the Conservatives had built 2.5m new homes since 2010 and said incentives for first-time buyers – such as her party's proposed stamp duty cut – were key. Mr John Potter accused some private companies of ""land banking"" by purchasing land and sitting on it. He said his party would introduce a ""use it or lose it"" policy to stop the practice. While Mr Lenox agreed that the private sector was contributing to the problem – saying there has been a ""developer free-for-all""– adding that the solution lies with councils building more houses. There are over a million voters across Lancashire – and 100 candidates across the county’s 15 constituencies. But there's only one vote that matters – yours. A full list of candidates nominated in seats across Lancashire is available on the BBC News website. Polls open at 07:00 BST on Thursday 4 July, with coverage online, radio and TV from when polls close at 22:00.

"Couple hold wedding reception at service station","By Christian Fuller",2024-07-02,"A couple have held their wedding reception at a service station in Surrey. Along with 42 guests, Stacey and her partner Graham celebrated their union at what they say is their favourite venue in the world - Cobham Services on the M25. The bride, from Surrey, said it had fulfilled a childhood dream as she had always wanted a “fast-food wedding”. The wedding party was treated to a selection of McDonald meals. Stacey admitted it was an “unconventional, but unforgettable setting”, but added: “Back from when I was a child, I’d always dreamed of wearing a pink princess dress and having my wedding reception in a fast food outlet. “I’ve repeatedly stated that fact, but even just two days before my wedding, my siblings couldn’t believe I was choosing to have it in a motorway service station – but it’s what I’d always wanted.” She added: “A massive thank you to everyone at Extra for helping a little girl’s dream to come true.” Tom Dobson, chief executive at Extra MSA, which operates Cobham services, said it was the first time the services had hosted a wedding reception. “We’re thrilled that we could make this unique celebration a reality,” he said. Stacey’s grandmother, Dawn, who also acted as the wedding organiser, said the service station had confirmed the booking within a day of making the enquiry. “They cordoned off a designated area and set up tables and chairs to suit our seating plan and guest numbers,” she said. “Several families at the services said to us what a great idea it was to host a wedding reception at a motorway service station, so who knows, maybe we’ve started a trend.” Follow BBC Surrey on Facebook and X.

"Putin vows deeper ties with Vietnam in visit criticised by US","By Jonathan Head",2024-06-20,"The leaders of Vietnam and Russia have said they want to boost ties as the pair met in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi. Vietnamese President To Lam was full of praise for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, congratulating him on his recent re-election. Mr Putin, in return, said strengthening a strategic partnership with the south-east Asian country was one of Russia's priorities. His trip to Vietnam, which comes on the heels of his lavish visit to North Korea, is being interpreted as a demonstration of the diplomatic support Russia still enjoys in the region. ""Congratulations to our comrade for receiving overwhelming support during the recent presidential election, underlining the confidence of the Russian people,"" President Lam said after Mr Putin was given a red carpet welcome. The United States has criticised the visit for giving a platform for President Putin to promote his war of aggression in Ukraine. Vietnam still values the historic ties it has with Russia even as it works to improve its relationship with Europe and the US. Looming over a small park in Ba Dinh, Hanoi’s political quarter, a five-meter high statue of Lenin depicts the Russian revolutionary in heroic pose. On his birthday every year a delegation of senior Vietnamese officials solemnly lay flowers and bow their heads before the statue, a gift from Russia when it was still the Soviet Union. Vietnam’s ties to Russia are close and go back many decades, to the vital military, economic and diplomatic support given by the Soviet Union to the new communist state in North Vietnam in the 1950s. Vietnam has described their relationship as ""filled with loyalty and gratitude"". After Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to throw out the murderous Khmer Rouge regime, it was isolated and sanctioned by China and the West, and depended heavily on Soviet assistance. Many older Vietnamese, including the powerful communist party secretary-general Nguyen Phu Trong, studied in Russia and learned the language. Today Vietnam’s economy has been transformed by its integration into global markets. Russia has fallen far behind China, Asia, the US and Europe as a trading partner. But Vietnam still uses mainly Russian-made military equipment, and relies on partnerships with Russian oil companies for oil exploration in the South China Sea. The invasion of Ukraine presented Vietnam with a diplomatic challenge, but one it has so far managed to meet. It has chosen to abstain on the various resolutions at the United Nations condemning Russia’s actions, yet maintained good relations with Ukraine and even sent some aid to Kyiv. They also share a legacy from the Soviet era; thousands of Vietnamese have worked and studied in Ukraine. This is all in keeping with Vietnam’s long-held foreign policy principles of being friends with everyone but avoiding all formal alliances - what the communist party leadership now calls ‘bamboo diplomacy’, bending with the buffeting winds of great power rivalry without being forced to take sides. It is why Vietnam has so readily upgraded its relations with the US, a country against which its older leaders fought a long and destructive war, in the interests of seeking lucrative markets for Vietnamese exports and balancing its close ties with its giant neighbour China. The US has objected to President Putin's official visit to Vietnam on the grounds that it undermines international efforts to isolate him, but it can hardly be surprised. Aside from the special historical links with Russia, public sentiment in Vietnam on the war in Ukraine is more ambivalent than in Europe. There is some admiration for Putin as a strongman who defies the West, and scepticism, fuelled partly by social media commentary, of the US and European claims to be upholding international law. This is also true in other Asian countries, where the Ukraine war is seen as a faraway crisis. In Thailand, for example, a historic military ally of the US which was on the opposite side to Russia during the Cold War, public opinion is just as divided as in Vietnam. Thais too value the even older links between its monarchy and the pre-revolutionary Tsars of Russia, and the Thai government maintains close ties with Russia today, valuing the contribution millions of Russians make to its tourist industry. How long Vietnam maintains its camaraderie with Vladimir Putin is less clear. It is already seeking alternative sources of military equipment, but ending its current dependence on Russia will take years. A series of high-level resignations inside the communist party recently suggest intense internal rivalries over the next generation of leaders, and, potentially, over which direction the country will take. But there is no talk yet of abandoning the ambition of being friends to all, and enemies of none. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"PM says Sizewell C is essential to energy security","By Mariam Issimdar",2024-06-19,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reinforced his party's commitment to nuclear energy during a tour of Sizewell B. Building permission for Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast, which will generate 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, was granted in July 2022 and was expected to cost £20bn. Quizzed about whether government had received any more assurances on further sources of private investment for the project, Mr Sunak told reporters: ""We are confident of delivery of our nuclear plant"". In its manifesto, Labour said it would ""end a decade of dithering"" on nuclear power,  and would ensure the long-term security of the sector. ""The choice for people at this election is between a Conservative Party that believes in prioritising our energy security, investing more in nuclear, also making sure we get to Net Zero (emissions), in a sensible proportionate way that does not saddle ordinary families with massive bills,"" Mr Sunak said. He took aim at Labour's energy policy, accusing the party of ""rushing towards Net Zero faster than other countries"" and ""banning North Sea energy"" (new oil and gas licences), which he claimed would lead to higher household bills. On oil and gas, Labour said it expected ""production in the North Sea will be with us for decades to come, and the North Sea will be managed in a way that does not jeopardise jobs. ""We will not issue new licences to explore new fields because they will not take a penny off bills, cannot make us energy secure, and will only accelerate the worsening climate crisis,"" the party said. The Green party's manifesto has a commitment ""to see a phase-out of nuclear energy, which is unsafe and much more expensive than renewables. ""The development of nuclear power stations is too slow given the pace of action we need on climate,"" the party said. ""They also create unmanageable quantities of radioactive waste and are inextricably linked with the production of nuclear weapons."" Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said recently: ""The road to national energy security must lead to real change – a turn away from fossil fuels and a massive investment in renewable energy generation and energy saving programmes like home insulation delivered through local authorities."" Reform said it wanted to fast-track clean nuclear energy with new small modular reactors, built in Britain. It would also increase and incentivise ethical UK lithium mining for electric batteries, promote combined cycle gas turbines, clean synthetic fuel, tidal power and explore clean coal mining. The Liberal Democrats made no mention of nuclear power in its manifesto but had a strong commitment to renewables. It wanted to ""accelerate the deployment of renewable power and deliver energy security by investing in energy storage, including green hydrogen, pumped storage and battery capability. It also wanted to work with European neighbours to build a sustainable supply chain for renewable energy technology. Campaign group, Stop Sizewell C, said: “We are not sure what comfort Sizewell C staff can draw from a visit by a clearly outgoing Prime Minister whose government failed to get the project over the line. ""More importantly, the likely incoming Energy Secretary had to be pressed to mention Sizewell C on his visit to East Anglia. ""We urge a Labour government to hit pause and reconsider this ill-advised project. ""Backing Sizewell C would be backing yesterday’s technology, just as wind power is poised to overtake gas as Britain’s main source of electricity."" Follow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

"The RSPCA at 200: Life as an inspector","By Charlie Haynes",2024-06-16,"In 1824, the world’s first animal welfare organisation - now known as the RSPCA - was founded. Two centuries on, what is it like to work for the charity? The shed is overgrown, stacked with cages. The smell of rotten meat and faeces is overwhelming. This isn't an abattoir - it's a semi-detached house in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. RSPCA inspector Michelle Hare stands listening to an elderly man, while one of her colleagues picks through the grim contents of the cages. “My wife, she’s not a cruel person. She loves her animals. This will kill her.” He is frail, and no taller than 5ft 5in – but he’s angry. “Whoever shopped us. You don’t want me to find out who it is.” I’ve spent three days with Michelle, trying to get a sense of what she faces day to day. I expected the job to be all about animals, but it’s much more complicated. Britain’s best-known animal charity had uniformed officers on the streets before the Metropolitan Police. In the years that followed it, founding laws were passed banning bull and bear baiting, as well as cruelty to dogs and other domestic animals, and better standards were brought in at slaughterhouses. In 1840 Queen Victoria gave permission for the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to add ""royal"" to its name - and it became the RSPCA. Back then, inspectors focused on live animal markets and working animals. But the basic aim of encouraging better welfare is the same now as it was in the 1800s. On my first day with the RSPCA, I meet Michelle at an animal rescue centre in Leicester. Our initial call-out is to investigate reports of an abandoned dog in the city. When we arrive, Michelle squeezes down a side alley and climbs onto a box to peer over a garden fence. “Oh, hello baby.” In a shed at the end of the garden sits an XL bully. It growls at her. “I know, you don’t want to be my friend.” The garden is overgrown, with a discarded car tyre and a broken swing. The dog clearly doesn't appreciate visitors. Michelle puts a small piece of tape across the house's front door, a trick of the trade which should later help her establish whether anyone is using the house. Inspectors can only enter a property to take an animal if they have evidence it's abandoned. As we're leaving, a neighbour comes out to speak to us. They tell us the house’s occupant is in prison for a violent offence, and the whole street is worried about the dog, which has been howling through the night. Another neighbour has been throwing food over the fence. Later, after the dog warden and police have been alerted, it becomes clear the XL bully is unregistered. Because the breed was banned earlier this year - and the law doesn't allow ownership to be transferred - the police remove and euthanise the abandoned animal. The RSPCA admits this is a difficult issue for them. The charity campaigned against the legislation and says there is no ""robust scientific evidence"" which shows a ban on any breed effectively protects the public. It has to work within the current law, but says in the long term improved legislation is needed to encourage responsible ownership alongside robust enforcement. The next call-out takes us to a lake on the Leicestershire-Warwickshire border. When we arrive, water company Severn Trent is already on the scene. One thoughtless act - oil dumped into the water system – has left the lake's surface with a thick, silvery coating. Oil is life-threatening to birds because it coats their feathers, stripping them of their waterproofing. This prevents them from flying and also affects their buoyancy. Often, they have to stay on land or risk drowning. The RSPCA has designated the spill a major incident – and there is a large group of inspectors and Animal Rescue Officers (AROs) on site. Michelle and fellow inspector Boris jump onto a boat and make their way to a small island in the middle of the lake. After squeezing through densely-growing trees and bushes, they hear the sound of chirping and find a group of distressed goslings. The chicks should be a fluffy yellow-grey colour, but instead are coated with a black tar-like oil. They also have red blotches on their skin. “We’ve got some burning where the oil has been on,” says Cara Gibbon – an ARO who has also been searching the island. “We need to get you guys in for a wash don’t we?” The goslings’ mother is slowly swimming away, sitting low in the water as her natural waterproofing is sapped away by the oil. The inspectors chase her down in their boat. She eventually tires of swimming and makes for land, where she stops, exhausted, unable to escape by flying. While the RSPCA was able to catch some of the birds living at the lake, there were many more animals they weren’t able to rescue. Over the following days, scores of fish float to the surface of the lake, killed by the toxic oil. Severn Trent says it is still investigating the cause of the spill. In the three days I spent with Michelle, we chased wild geese, responded to complaints of animal cruelty, checked on 25 dogs being kept on a building site, and much more. The average RSPCA inspector travels 80 miles a day. In total, we visited five towns in four counties across the Midlands. Inspectors are responsible for investigating cruelty, neglect and organised animal crime - Michelle tells me she is busier than ever. Our final call-out, in Ilkeston, is to a report of a handful of rabbits and guinea pigs being kept in “grubby” conditions. When we arrive, it becomes obvious the problem is on a much larger scale. In the garden of the semi-detached house are at least eight small sheds. The RSPCA inspectors look inside and what they find is distressing. There are about 160 animals - ferrets, rabbits, guinea pigs, canaries and snakes - being kept in squalor. ""These animals are living in darkness, pitch black, no ventilation, no light, no space, just wading around in their own excrement,"" says Michelle. ""They’ve got mites, they might have ring worm, we’ve got injuries from fighting because of overcrowding."" They have also been reproducing, she adds, and some of the young are ""very thin"". The owner is an elderly woman who has kept large numbers of pets for over five decades. She appears close to tears as the inspectors go through the cages, questioning her about the welfare of the animals. Despite the evidently awful conditions, the woman's husband remains fiercely protective of her. Michelle says it all indicates an addiction to animal collecting, even hoarding. The majority of the pets are  subsequently confiscated, going to animal centres across the Midlands and north of England, leaving the couple with just a handful. The RSPCA says court action is an absolute last resort. Because the owners co-operated with the inspectors and were considered “vulnerable”, they narrowly avoided a prosecution. Michelle tells me: “You can’t do this job if you don’t know how to work with people.” “I would say eight in 10 people we come across have some sort of vulnerability, be it a mental health condition, a learning disability, lack of language skills or something else.” She has been an inspector for 17 years and says a large part of her job is working with people who are struggling the most. “A good inspector isn’t just able to care for animals - at the core of the job, they have to understand people.” Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

"China is the true power in Putin and Kim’s budding friendship","By Laura Bicker",2024-06-19,"The welcome hug on the tarmac at 03:00, the honour guard of mounted soldiers, the huge portraits of Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin hanging side by side in the centre of Pyongyang – all of this was designed to worry the West. Mr Putin’s first visit to Pyongyang since 2000 was a chance for Russia and North Korea to flaunt their friendship. And flaunt it they did, with Mr Kim declaring his “full support” for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Seoul, Tokyo, Washington and Brussels will see great peril in those words and in the stage-managed meeting. But the fact is the two leaders feel they need each other - Mr Putin badly requires ammunition to keep the war going and North Korea needs money. However, the real power in the region was not in Pyongyang – and nor did it want to be. Mr Putin and Mr Kim were bonding on China’s doorstep and so would have been wary of  provoking Beijing, a vital source of both trade and clout for these two sanctioned regimes. And even as Mr Putin hails his “firm friendship” with Mr Kim, he must know it has a limit. And that limit is Chinese President Xi Jinping. There are some signs Mr Xi disapproves of the burgeoning alliance between two of his allies. Reports suggest Beijing urged President Putin not to visit Pyongyang straight after meeting President Xi in May. It seems Chinese officials did not like the optics of North Korea being included in that visit. Mr Xi is already under considerable pressure from the US and Europe to cut support for Moscow and to stop selling it components that are fuelling its war in Ukraine. And he cannot ignore these warnings. Just as the world needs the Chinese market, Beijing also needs foreign tourists and investment to fight off sluggish growth and retain its spot as the world’s second-largest economy. It is now offering visa-free travel to visitors from parts of Europe as well as from Thailand and Australia. And its pandas are once again being dispatched to foreign zoos. Perceptions matter to China’s ambitious leader, who wants to take on a bigger global role and challenge the US. He certainly does not want to become a pariah or face fresh pressure from the West. At the same time, he is still managing his relationship with Moscow. While he has not condemned the invasion of Ukraine, he has so far failed to provide significant military assistance to Russia. And during the meeting in May, his cautious rhetoric was in contrast to Mr Putin’s florid compliments about Mr Xi. So far, China has also provided political cover for Mr Kim’s efforts to advance his nuclear arsenal, repeatedly blocking US-led sanctions at the United Nations. But Mr Xi is no fan of an emboldened Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang’s weapons tests have enabled Japan and South Korea to set aside their bitter history to ink a defence deal with the US. And when tensions rise, more US warships turn up in Pacific waters, triggering Mr Xi’s fears of an “East Asian Nato”. Beijing’s disapproval may force Russia to reconsider selling more technology to the North Koreans. The possibility of that happening is also one of the US’ biggest concerns. Andrei Lankov, the director of NK News, says he is sceptical: “I don’t expect Russia to provide North Korea with a large amount of military technology.” He believes Russia “is not getting much and probably creating potential problems for the future” if it did so. While North Korean artillery would be a shot in the arm for Mr Putin’s war effort, swapping missile tech for it would not exactly be a great deal. And Mr Putin might realise it’s not worth irking China, which buys Russian oil and gas, and remains a crucial ally in a world that has isolated him. Pyongyang needs China even more. It’s the only other country Mr Kim visits. Anywhere between a quarter to a half of North Korea’s oil comes from Russia, but at least 80% of its business is with China. One analyst described the China-North Korea relationship as an oil lamp that keeps burning. In short: however much Mr Putin and Mr Kim try to appear as allies, their relationship with China is far more important than what they share. Despite their avowed fight against the “imperialist West”, this is a wartime partnership. It may develop but, for now, it appears transactional, even as they upgrade their partnership to the level of “alliance”. The impressive-sounding Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement between the two countries, announced at the meeting between Mr Putin and Mr Kim, is no guarantee that Pyongyang can keep supplying ammunition. Mr Kim needs supplies for himself as he has a front of his own to maintain - the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) border with South Korea. Analysts also believe Russia and North Korea use different operating systems, with the latter’s being low-quality and growing old. More importantly, Russia and North Korea did not prioritise their relationship for decades. When he was friendly with the West, Mr Putin sanctioned Pyongyang twice and even joined the US, China, South Korea and Japan to persuade the North to give up its nuclear programme. When Kim Jong Un ventured out for a whirlwind of diplomatic summits in 2018, he met Vladimir Putin only once. Back then Mr Kim’s wide smiles, hugs and handshakes were for the South Korean president Moon Jae-in. They met three times. He exchanged “love letters” with then US President Donald Trump before their three meetings – a man he once called a “dotard” suddenly became “special”. He also held three summits with Mr Xi, the first international leader he ever met. So Mr Putin is new to the party. And yet he has not turned on the charm, while Mr Kim has lined the streets with roses and red carpets. The Russian leader’s column in the North Korean state newspaper highlighted shared interests to “resolutely oppose” Western ambitions to “hinder the establishment of a multi-polar world order based on a mutual respect for justice”. But it was missing the flattery he heaped on Mr Xi, who he declared was as close as a “brother”, while praising a slowing Chinese economy for “developing in leaps and bounds”. He even said his family were learning Mandarin. He certainly would not dare keep President Xi waiting for hours and arrive as late as he did in Pyongyang. They also don’t seem to have worked out who is the more important partner, judging by the awkward moment where they debated who should get in a car first. With China, they are both supplicants. And without China, they and their regimes will struggle. BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

"Duke's wedding protest women released on bail","By Paul Burnell",2024-06-10,"Two women who were arrested after a protest outside the Duke of Westminster’s wedding have been released on bail. Billionaire aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor, 33, and bride Olivia Henson, 31, were outside Chester Cathedral with members of their wedding party, including the Prince of Wales, when orange powder paint was released from a fire extinguisher by a member of the crowd. Police said the two women, aged 69 and 73, who were arrested on suspicion of public order offences had now been bailed until September 2. Just Stop Oil claimed responsibility for the protest. A Cheshire Police spokesman said: “Shortly after 1pm on Friday, a coloured flare was released by two women, believed to be protesting on behalf of Just Stop Oil, in St Werburgh Street, Chester. “Officers were immediately on the scene and two women were quickly arrested on suspicion of public order offences. “The 69-year-old woman, from Bristol, and 73-year-old woman, from Ipswich, have both been released on police bail until September 2.” About 400 guests, including Princess Eugenie and TV producer Phil Redmond, attended the wedding before a reception was held at the duke’s family estate at nearby Eaton Hall.

"New faces of protest - Kenya's Gen Z anti-tax revolutionaries","By Wycliffe Muia",2024-06-20,"A bold and new generation of young Kenyan protesters has emerged on the streets forcing the government to back down on some of a slew of unpopular tax proposals. What started as anger on TikTok about a controversial finance bill has morphed into a revolt - without being organised by political parties. The government of President William Ruto has managed to do what generations of politicians in the East African nation have failed to do - unite huge numbers of Kenyans beyond ethnicity and party. On Tuesday, hundreds of trainer-wearing protesters, who feel Kenyans are already overtaxed with little to show for it, braved tear gas lobbed by police to march through the capital, Nairobi, bringing the city's central business district to a standstill. Armed with their smartphones, they live-streamed the intense confrontations with officers. The protests, dubbed ""occupy parliament"", were co-ordinated and mobilised on social media in contrast to those led and sponsored by politicians. Organisers encouraged fellow protesters to wear black clothes, but some still turned up in ripped jeans and stylish hairdos. The youthful demonstrators, popularly referred to as Gen Zs - in reference to the term generally used to describe those born during the late 1990s and early 2000s -  showed up in huge numbers, vowing to ensure that their discontent did not end with just a hashtag or meme. “We are the Gen Zs, we were able to mobilise ourselves. We use TikTok as a space to be able to not only have young people come to protest but to educate them on the why,” protester Zaha Indimuli told journalists. Many of them were demonstrating for the first time and waved signs such as ""Do Not Force The Taxes On Us"" , while others chanted: “Ruto must go”. ""I’m here slaving for a country I love. It is the first time I'm doing this because my parents are old and they cannot do it any more,"" Ken Makilya, a 24-year-old university student, told the BBC. The hashtags used to pressure MPs and rally protesters were ""#OccupyParliament"" and ""#RejectFinanceBill2024"". “This is my first demonstration. I hope it will be the last. I hope things change after this,"" said Naserian Kasura, who opposed the proposal to tax sanitary pads. The protesters' efforts to march to parliament were thwarted as police used water cannon to block them. ""We have been arrested but don’t let them get to you please proceed to parliament,"" Hanifa Farsafi, reportedly one of the organisers, posted on X, formerly Twitter. More than 200 young protesters were arrested but some of them were later released after lawyers went to the police stations where they had been detained. “I am not going, I am not co-operating, why are you arresting me?” one protester was heard saying in a viral video as she refused to board a police vehicle. Those who did not make it to the streets helped spread the word by sharing messages, pictures and videos on social media. As the protest lacked any clear leadership, the police have found it hard to target those behind it. They banned the march on a technicality though the protesters said all requirements had been met. And unlike previous political anti-government protests, it was not characterised by looting, destruction of property and stone-throwing. No political affiliations or ethnic alignments were mentioned - just a clear determination by the protesters to be heard. Several hours after the demonstrators had mobilised, the presidency appeared to bow to the pressure and announced that it would scrap some of the bill's most contentious provisions, including a proposed 16% value-added tax (VAT) on bread. ""We have listened to the view of Kenyans,” Kuria Kimani, the chairman of parliament's finance committee, said at a press briefing attended by President Ruto and lawmakers in the ruling coalition. Changes to the finance bill were driven by a “need to protect Kenyans from increased cost of living”, Mr Kimani added. The government had earlier defended the tax hikes, which had been projected to raise $2.7bn (£2.1bn), saying they were needed to cut reliance on external borrowing. Other proposed taxes that have been axed include ones on cooking oil, mobile money services and on motor vehicles, which critics said would have hit the insurance industry. MPs are now debating the revised bill and are expected to vote on it next Tuesday. The opposition, which did not participate in the demonstrations, wants the withdrawal of the entire bill, terming it ""punitive"". Another hashtag being used by the campaigners is ""#unfollowRuto"",  encouraging people to stop following the president on X in a bid to pressure him to drop the bill. They have vowed to continue with the protests in Nairobi and other cities until the bill is dropped altogether A few days ago, presidential adviser David Ndii had rudely dismissed online efforts that started on TikTok around two weeks ago, but following Tuesday's show of strength he acknowledged their achievement. Following the publication of the draft bill, TikTokers began making video explainers that were widely shared on other platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and X - that would trend for days helped by pushes from Kenyan influencers. One tactic that has forced MPs to take notice is the list of their phone numbers that has been shared across social media with the message ""SMS your MP"". MP Stephen Mule told local media that his phone was spammed with more than 30,000 messages from young Kenyans asking him to reject the bill. Other legislators have also complained that their phones have become practically unusable because of the number of texts they were receiving. Local media have also picked up the online conversations, amplifying the voices of protest and issues about the cost of living. Some urged veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, who has been the face of anti-government protests for years, to stay away from Tuesday's march. He obliged, posting on social media: ""I’m a very proud father today! Well done to all those who bravely stood up for their rights!"" Mutuma Mathiu, a veteran journalist, said Tuesday's events had shifted the dynamics of Kenyan politics: ""Protest politics found a new fulcrum and a new and different generation of Kenyans found their rather loud voice."" Popular political commentator Pauline Njoroge agreed: “They are not just brave, they are also very cool and well spoken. Today’s youth-led protest has been the most peaceful yet very successful."" Prof Kivutha Kibwana, a law scholar and a former county governor, urged dialogue in his post on X: ""The most dangerous thing for a government to do is to declare war on its youth."" Dr Willy Mutunga, a former chief justice, said young people across the world had a common enemy in ""their respective ruling classes, warning: ""The uprising is on the horizon."" The government has long held fears that social media could be used to promote discord and has pushed for stricter oversight by regulators. The online collective known as Kenyans on X (KOX) is renowned for calling out issues and Kenya is among the countries with the highest TikTok usage rate worldwide. In March, the interior minister threatened to restrict the use of TikTok, which he accused of spreading malicious content. But the protesters do not intend to be cowed. ""We are not scared, we are not moved and this is only the beginning of the revolution. We are coming, we are many and in good numbers,"" said Ms Indimuli from the sidelines of Tuesday's demonstration. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

"Duke and duchess 'touched' by wedding wishes","By Rumeana Jahangir & PA Media",2024-06-09,"The Duke and Duchess of Westminster have thanked guests and well-wishers for making their wedding day “so memorable”. Hugh Grosvenor, a godson of King Charles, married Olivia Henson at Chester's medieval cathedral on Friday - with Prince William attending as an usher. The duke is one of the richest men in the country, with a fortune estimated to be worth £10.1 billion. In a joint statement, the newlyweds said: ""We have been incredibly touched by everyone's amazing support and warm wishes."" About 400 guests, including Princess Eugenie and TV producer Phil Redmond, attended the wedding before a reception was held at the duke’s family estate at nearby Eaton Hall. The King and Queen were not present after travelling to France for D-Day commemorations, while the Princess of Wales did not attend as she continues to undergo cancer treatment. The Duke of Sussex was also not present. The couple said: ""We are deeply grateful to everyone who supported us yesterday and want to extend a special thank you to those in Chester who helped make our day so memorable."" People in the city centre were offered free ice creams in honour of the occasion, after the couple teamed up with three local independent businesses to provide the treats. The city’s annual Summer Flowers project was also funded by the duke and duchess, with 100,000 flowers planted as part of the wedding celebrations. The duke became a billionaire on inheriting his title and control of the Grosvenor Estate at the age of 25, following his father’s death in 2016. His firm, Grosvenor Group, owns property in London's wealthy Mayfair and Belgravia districts, as well as city centre developments such as the Liverpool One shopping centre. Two women, aged 69 and 73, were arrested after orange powder was released as guests left the ceremony. Just Stop Oil said the pair were supporters of their group and disrupted the ceremony as part of calls on the government to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.

"Sheryl Crow: 'Resurrecting Tupac with AI is hateful'","By Mark Savage",2024-06-22,"Sheryl Crow has something to get off her chest. Over the years, the nine-time Grammy winner has never been scared to voice her opinion. Known for the classic roots rock of songs like My Favourite Mistake and All I Wanna Do, she has also used her voice to campaign on issues like gun control and climate change. Now, she has her sights set on Artificial Intelligence. The title track of her new album, Evolution, grapples with the impact of AI on people and the planet. Speaking to the BBC, she characterises the technology as a “slippery slope” and “a betrayal” that “goes against everything humanity is based on”. Her attention was focused on the software last year, after meeting a young songwriter who’d been employing it in her work. Frustrated that male artists wouldn’t listen to her demos, Crow's acquaintance paid to have an AI clone of singer-songwriter John Mayer replace her vocals. When Crow heard the song, she was so “terrified” that she was “literally hyperventilating”. “I know John and I know the nuances of his voice,” she says. “And there would be no way you’d have been able to tell that he was not singing that song."" Her horror deepened when Drake used AI to resurrect the voice of late rapper Tupac Shakur on his song Taylor Made Freestyle earlier this year. The track was subsequently removed after lawyers from Tupac's estate threatened to sue, but Crow says it should never have been released in the first place. “You cannot bring people back from the dead and believe that they would stand for that,” she protests. “I’m sure Drake thought, ‘Yeah, I shouldn't do it, but I'll say sorry later’.  But it’s already done, and people will find it even if he takes it down. “It's hateful. It is antithetical to the life force that exists in all of us.”  As the mother of two teenagers, she’s worried about the implications of AI not just in music, but in politics and society. If voices and likenesses can be faked, how do we stop the spread of misinformation? And what happens to the workforce when AI takes over everyday tasks? “I talk to my kids about it,” she says. “I'm like, ‘You're growing up with this thing and it doesn't seem dangerous to you because you're a frog in a pot of water. But the water is only just starting to boil, and you won’t realise it's getting hotter until we're all floating on the top’.” The star has already called on politicians to enact tighter controls on AI - but although she’s concerned about the rapidity of its progress, she also sees a sliver of hope. “AI can do lots of things, but it can't go out and play live,” she says. “So as long as we have live music, as long as we have hands holding a paintbrush, all is not lost.” Live music is on her mind because Crow has just wrapped up a week of UK concerts in historic venues like Blenheim Palace and Hampton Court. The setlists leaned heavily on her first four albums, including 1990s radio staples like Everyday Is A Winding Road, Soak Up The Sun, My Favourite Mistake and Leaving Las Vegas. The 62-year-old says she’s content playing the hits. “What a gift, to be able to go out and play at my age. I literally look at my band and go, ‘I can't believe we're still getting to do this!’” she laughs. Relaxed and convivial despite her jetlag, Crow exudes just enough rock star energy to turn heads as she walks through the BBC in a plum velvet waistcoat and flared blue jeans. But despite 50 million record sales, she gives the impression that her career is one big happy accident. In a way, it is. Born in Missouri, Crow was a high-achiever at school becoming an all-state track athlete and a majorette - but she never quite fitted in, constantly finding herself “on the periphery of a lot of different groups”. Music was her outlet. Rejecting “corporate” bands like Boston and Foreigner, she gravitated towards the grit and glamour of blues and rock. “I wanted more swagger, you know? Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, that kind of thing.” Her first group didn’t offer much opportunity for swagger. A covers band playing weddings and events, their repertoire consisted of hits by Huey Lewis and Heart. “All the greats from 80s,” she grimaces. “Not my favourite period of music.” After school, she studied classical piano, then moved to St Louis to become a music teacher, while moonlighting as a club singer. “One night, a producer came in and asked if I’d come in and sing a couple of jingles for him, and those jingles paid me more money than all my years of teaching.” She made enough from Toyota and McDonald’s to move to LA, armed with a demo tape of her commercials. That led to more work as a session singer and, eventually, a stint on Michael Jackson’s Bad tour (he used to throw sweets at her over the dressing room wall). “After the Jackson tour, I’d had all this exposure and I tried to get a record deal,” she says. “But I wasn’t a technical singer like Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey, and I wasn’t interested in doing the dance music thing like Madonna and Paula Abdul.”  Eventually, A&M Records took a punt – impressed by a self-produced demo that was heavily influenced by Sting and Peter Gabriel's solo albums. They paired her with Sting's producer, Hugh Padgham, but once the album was finished, Crow lost confidence in the material. “I couldn't find myself in it. The songs were sort of innocuous and it didn’t really represent who I wanted to be.” When she told the label, they weren’t impressed. “That record cost a lot of money. I’m talking $450,000 in 1990s money, and they needed to make that money back. “So it was really, really hard. They weren't in a hurry to put me back in the studio.”  In the end, she fell in with a songwriting collective, the Tuesday Music Club, through her then-boyfriend Kevin Gilbert. Each week, they’d gather in Pasadena and try to write a complete song before dawn broke. The sessions were recorded by Michael Jackson’s producer Bill Bottrell for “about two cents” and released as Crow’s debut album in 1993. Blending roots, Americana, emotional confessions, melody and intelligence, the album was slow to catch fire. It didn’t even chart for the first seven months of release. In the UK, Danny Baker was an early champion, playing the singles Run, Baby Run and Leaving Las Vegas on BBC Radio 1 - but it was the slice-of-life bar room anthem All I Wanna Do that turned the album's fortunes around, much to Crow’s surprise. “I was not convinced by All I Wanna Do,” she says. “I felt it was a throwaway from a drunken night of jamming . “But on reflection, there was something very authentic to the spirit of that song.  There was a lot of burnout and apathy at the time, with this old guy [George Bush Sr] in office, but also the great hope of Bill Clinton appealing to the MTV audience. So I think the song captured a moment.""  A top five hit on both sides of the Atlantic, it helped Tuesday Night Music Club sell more than11 million copies worldwide… but Crow still felt like an outsider. Grunge and alternative rock were in the ascendance, and no-one knew quite what to do with this country-coded throwback rock singer. “I wasn't cool to Pearl Jam,” she recalls. “I certainly wasn't cool to Smashing Pumpkins. “But what wound up happening was I got embraced by people I loved. The Rolling Stones took me on the road with them and Bob Dylan invited me to open for him. What an incredible gift.”  Dylan donated an unreleased song, Mississippi, to Crow’s third album, The Globe Sessions. She went on to record a Bond theme, Tomorrow Never Dies, and duets with Prince and Johnny Cash. She was even considered to replace Christine McVie on Fleetwood Mac's 2003 world tour. “There were talks, yeah, but I kind of blew it,” she says. “I talked about it in the press. And I think Lindsay [Buckingham] got really…” She stops herself before she says the wrong thing. “I mean, I love everyone in that band. And I feel honoured to be able to say that. Just knowing them has been amazing.”  Stevie Nicks has been a huge presence in her life before and since. Last November, she turned up to support Crow upon her induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. “I am so proud of you,"" Nicks told the singer. ""It's a very elite club for us women. I found out at four o'clock in the morning and had to dance around my room for you.” Also joining the celebration was Olivia Rodrigo, who has spoken glowingly of Crow's influence on her songwriting. She’s not the only one. Indie supergroup Boygenius wrote their breakout hit Not Strong Enough as a response to Crow’s song Strong Enough; Kacey Musgraves recorded her Golden Hour at Crow’s home studio in Nashville; and St Vincent recently phoned up for advice on producing her new album. Crow is blown away by all the love coming her way. “It’s amazing,” she says. “The young women right now that are playing and singing and writing authentically is blowing my mind because, 15 or 20 years ago, I really worried that everything was just dance routines and lip syncing and boobs and lips. “I was just like, ‘When are we going to have young female songwriters who pick up guitars and gut wrenchingly tell us about where they're at? “And I'm seeing that now from Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor and Boygenius and Courtney Barnett. It’s so fun. I feel so optimistic.”  And what if her sons decide to follow her onto the stage? They've already made a brief (but cute) appearance during her Glastonbury set in 2019 and the singer says she’ll be supportive, no matter where life takes them. “I try to help my kids navigate life, as opposed to trying to orchestrate their lives,” she says. “There's nothing off limits. I even tell my kids, ‘If you drink, my phone is on, you call me to come get you, you will not get grounded’.” Isn’t that because they could easily look up her youthful misdemeanours on Google? “We talked about that!” she laughs. “I talked about the fact that I cannot believe I'm alive, you know? “I remember late nights of recording out in Pasadena and driving my own car home, and not remembering how I got  there. I'm very lucky, some people aren’t. “I tell my kids, ‘Don't count on the angels’… But there are angels.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

"William among guests at Duke of Westminster's wedding","By Rumeana Jahangir, Chris Long & PA News",2024-06-07,"Thousands of well-wishers gathered in Chester for the wedding of the Duke of Westminster, where the Prince of Wales acted as an usher. Hugh Grosvenor, the godson of King Charles III, married Olivia Henson at the city's cathedral earlier. The 33-year-old duke is godfather to Prince George, but the 10-year-old could not join his father at the ceremony due to it falling on a school day. Two women were removed from the crowd by police after an orange plume was deployed from a fire extinguisher-type device as the couple left the cathedral. Campaign group Just Stop Oil said two of its supporters had used the device to project powder paint near the cathedral entrance as the newlyweds made their way to a car. Cheshire Police said two women, a 69-year-old from Manchester and 73-year-old from Suffolk, had been arrested on suspicion of public order offences and remained in custody. The duke is regarded as one of the richest people in the UK, with a fortune of about £10bn, while his bride has worked in the sustainable food and drinks industry. Along with being a godparent for Prince George, he is also reported to be godfather to the Duke of Sussex's son, Prince Archie. Prince Harry, who was an usher with his brother at the wedding of the duke’s sister Lady Tamara Grosvenor in 2004, is understood not to have attended the service by mutual agreement. The King and Queen Camilla did not attend the service, after travelling to Normandy for the D-Day commemorations on Thursday. The Princess of Wales, who is receiving treatment for cancer, also did not attend. The bride wore a dress and veil designed by Emma Victoria Payne, embroidered with floral motifs and edgings from Ms Henson's great-great-grandmother's veil from about 1880. The 31-year-old also wore a vintage tiara, incorporating a myrtle leaf design, which was made by the prestigious Russian jewellery craftmakers Fabergé for Grosvenor brides and has been worn on their wedding days since 1906. Her bouquet was made of flowers picked from the gardens of Eaton Hall, the duke's country house. Members of the public began arriving outside the cathedral from early in the morning, bringing camping chairs and picnics. By the time of the service, thousands were gathered outside the cathedral and in the surrounding streets and many of them witnessed the protest as the couple re-emerged. Barbara Williams, 81, from Cheshire, who was standing next to the protesters in the crowd, said she felt ""a bit shaken after it"". She said she and her friend Andrea Machin, 56, had been ""standing next to them all day"". ""They were already here when we arrived at 07:00 [and] they had shopping trolleys with them,"" Ms Machin said. ""Everyone was watching the bride and groom and then we just saw orange and they had what looked like a fire extinguisher with them. ""The police realised quite quickly what was happening and pulled them out. ""It happened just as William was coming out of the door."" In a statement issued by Just Stop Oil, the protesters said weddings were ""a time of coming together in celebration to make a commitment to the future"", but for ""countless millions around the world there is no future unless we come together to stop oil and gas"". A representative for the duke and Ms Henson said it meant ""a lot"" for them to marry in Chester, due to the Grosvenor family's ""long and close personal connection to both the cathedral and the city"". They said the couple had ""made a conscious effort to involve local and regional suppliers in several aspects of the day"". ""The couple have also been moved by the messages of support they have received from around the region and are hugely grateful that people want to share in their happiness,"" they added. The city’s annual Summer Flowers project has been funded by the couple, with 100,000 flowers planted as part of the wedding celebrations and they have also paid for free ice cream and sorbet from three local independent businesses to be given to visitors to Chester city centre through the day. Poppy, a student at the University of Chester, was one of those indulging in a free ice cream. She said it was ""great to see the people and the businesses together"". ""It’s really fun to get the students out in the city and involved,"" she added. The duke inherited his title and control of the Grosvenor Estate at the age of 25, following his father's death in 2016, and the couple announced their engagement in April 2023 after being together for two years.

"Your Voice, Your Vote: What Scots want from the election",NA,2024-06-09,"Before the country heads to the polls on 4 July, BBC Scotland News has been asking voters what matters to them. As part of our Your Voice, Your Vote series, we have been listening to the issues causing the most concern in communities up and down the country. This week, our reporters ventured to Orkney, Aberdeenshire, Tayside, North Lanarkshire and Fife to ask people what was going to influence their vote. The journey started at Kirkwall Harbour, the UK's busiest cruise destination, where 232 cruise liners will dock this year. Tourism is important but the big ticket items on people's minds were transport, cost of living and energy. They said everything on an island was more expensive. Liam Valentine, 33, and his daughter Ellie, who has just turned one, were enjoying the competition at a junior athletics weekend. Liam told BBC Scotland News his major concern for his growing family was the cost of living. He said: ""I think for future generations, especially having two young children that are going to go through it as well – then I feel we need to have more affordable housing and to be able to afford food."" Back on the mainland, the next stop was Broughty Ferry. It now forms a new constituency with Arbroath and Angus. People there said they wanted to see more economic help for young people. The subject of the NHS came up, as did crime, with calls for more police officers. Ian Ashton operates SaltDog Marine - which runs boat trips on the River Tay to see Dundee's dolphins. He said 80% of his customers were local to the city with the rest coming from countries like Japan and the USA. Ian told BBC Scotland News he would like to see regeneration in the area. He added: ""Having investment in things that draw people into your towns, I think, is really important. ""There's a real sense of community in Broughty Ferry, it has evaded the empty shops of the high street and, anything that can sustain that or promote that would be the big thing for most of the shop holders. ""I would say a look at rates would help."" Heading south to Coatbridge, traditionally an industrial town, the issue that kept coming up was the health service. Although a devolved matter and not therefore a general election issue as such, people were worried about its sustainability. At the Summerlee Mining Museum, locals said the NHS should be a ""number one"" priority for politicians. Younger voters worried about getting on the property ladder and the cost of living was on many minds. Anna Butterfield runs a Jo Jingles baby group. She has seen her business become less of a priority for parents. ""People's priorities are paying food bills. Once that's all paid we are seeing a decline in class numbers because they can't afford to come to classes."" Mother-of-two Adele Doolan attends the class. She said: ""I would like to hear more about the cost of living. ""You know having a young family and trying to support them is quite a challenge these days - especially if you're trying to maintain family life, running a house and going out and doing activities and classes that are beneficial to children."" Adele said her average shopping bill had gone up by about £30 per week. She added: ""That then eats into family activities - socialising at the weekends when we're all off together, coming to classes and things like that. ""Child benefit doesn't really go that far. You've got nappies to buy, clothes to get them. ""The cost of fuel as well is absolutely ridiculous. ""So to go anywhere, it can be quite a challenge."" In Aberdeenshire, Graham Barron is director of Coast Radio, Peterhead's new community radio station. He said that oil and gas were major employers in the North East. But despite there being wealth in the region, there were also pockets of deprivation. He said: ""I think generally the issues, particularly in Peterhead, are pretty much the issues affecting the rest of the country. ""We've got deprivation and our town centres are looking in a bit of a sorry state. ""We have got to make sure that whoever is coming in after 4 July are going to look after those industries.'' North East skipper John Clark said the fishing industry was important to Peterhead. ''Our biggest issue is the lack of quota,"" he said. ""We're seeing lots of fish in the grounds but we haven't got the quota to actually land it. ""So we actually have to move areas. ""We actually thought with Brexit we would get a fairer share of the quota but with Brexit, it didn't happen.'' At Leven Bowling Club, in Fife, the clubhouse gives members a chance to reflect on the town's past and future. Members say their thoughts for the election are turning to the economy and a lack of opportunities for young people. Local people believe the closure of the train line in the 1960s contributed  to the area's decline but the newly restored Levenmouth rail link is a source of optimism. Rebecca Moncrieff opened her homeware business a year ago because she wanted to invest her own town. ""Business at the moment in Leven is challenging,"" she admitted. ""But the train line opened up last week and things seem to be on the up."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Tories accepted donation from Hester after Abbott row","By Henry Zeffman",2024-06-06,"The Conservative Party accepted a further donation from Frank Hester, after he had been accused of making racist comments about Labour's Diane Abbott. The businessman donated £150,000 to the party through his healthcare software company, The Phoenix Partnership, on 8 March. The donation was then formally accepted by the Tories on 14 March, according to the Electoral Commission. New figures released by the commission also confirm he donated £5m in January, before he became embroiled in the row. Mr Hester previously made £10m of donations to the Conservatives last year. In March – after the latest £5m was donated but before it was known about – the tech boss was thrust to the centre of a political controversy after claims he made comments to staff saying that Ms Abbott “should be shot”. The £150,000 donation was accepted the day after Rishi Sunak faced a volley of criticism at prime minister’s questions about Mr Hester. He condemned the alleged comments as “wrong” and “racist”, but made clear that the Conservatives would not return Mr Hester’s money. Mr Hester apologised for making ""rude"" comments about Ms Abbott but said his remarks ""had nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin"". He declined to comment when approached by the BBC about the latest donations. Ms Abbott accused Mr Sunak of ""pure hypocrisy"" for accepting donations from Mr Hester. ""If he really objected to Hester’s remarks Sunak would not still be taking his money,"" she told the BBC. Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said: ""Rishi Sunak has proven he is a man with no integrity. “He is too weak to return the money donated by a man who has made violent, misogynist, and racist remarks which belong nowhere near our politics."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “How low can Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives go? If the Conservatives spend this money they will be proudly funded by a man who made the most appalling racist and sexist comments. ""Ultimately the buck stops with Rishi Sunak. Sunak must personally intervene and make sure not a penny of this money is spent."" A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Mr Hester has rightly apologised for comments made in the past. ""As Mr Hester has apologised and shown contrition and we consider the matter resolved."" A number of former employees of Mr Hester have told the BBC he regularly made remarks they regarded as racist and sexist. Two of them said they recalled him making comments about Asian people. One said he referred to some staff as ""the Asian girls"". Another said he mimicked accents in meetings. Another ex-employee criticised the prime minister for accepting Mr Hester's apology, saying: ""It's not a one off... There was absolutely a culture of Frank making seriously awful comments."" All the former employees spoke to the BBC in March on the basis of anonymity. Mr Hester was by far the Conservatives’ biggest donor in the first quarter of 2024. The next biggest was Sir Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line, who gave the party £500,000. Other notable donors include the businessmen Lord Hintze and Lord Ashcroft, who each donated £50,000. In the same period Labour received £1.6m from Ecotricity, the company controlled by Dale Vince, taking his recent donations to the Labour Party to around £4m. Mr Vince attracted controversy last year after it emerged he had also donated to Just Stop Oil. He stopped funding the campaign group in October, saying their protests were “counterproductive”. Labour also accepted £700,000 from the hedge fund manager Martin Taylor. Away from the business world, the party received £180,000 from Grayson Perry and £85,000 from Maggi Hambling, both artists. by Daniel Wainwright, BBC Verify Mr Hester’s company was the source of more than half of all donations declared by the Conservatives in the first few months of 2024. Electoral Commission data shows the party received just under £9m from 189 sources, excluding public funds. Just over £5m of that was from Mr Hester’s company, the Phoenix Partnership. Mr Hester and his company also donated more than £10m declared in 2023. Total donations received by the Tories and declared the first quarter of 2024 were 26% down on the same period in 2023. Labour, meanwhile, has seen donations rise 67% (almost £3m more) in January to March 2024 compared with the same three months of 2023, donations to the Lib Dems are up by 83% (over £1m more) and donations to the Greens have doubled (rising by £181,000). Reform UK has declared £25,000 in donations but its former leader Richard Tice has previously loaned the party money, details of which are recorded separately from donations by the Electoral Commission. Labour’s biggest donor, electicity company Ecotricity, provided 22% of all donations the party registered in the first quarter of 2024. Ecotricity was founded by Dale Vince, who has also given money to Just Stop Oil. The largest sum donated to Labour by a union was £381,837 from Unite, but this was Labour’s fourth biggest source of donations in that three-month period. A total of £10m of donations from Mr Hester last year had already been revealed in the Electoral Commission register. There is a three-month lag before donations are made public by the commission. Tortoise Media reported in March that the Tories had received a further £5m from the businessman but the Tories had previously refused to confirm whether this was the case. Mr Hester allegedly said in 2019 that veteran MP Diane Abbott made him ""want to hate all black women"" and should ""be shot"". At the time the comments were reported, Ms Abbott was suspended from sitting as a Labour MP for saying Irish, Jewish and Traveller people were not subject to racism ""all their lives"". She withdrew her remarks and apologised ""for any anguish caused"". The row increased pressure on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to lift the suspension of Ms Abbott, who was the first black woman to be elected to Parliament. However, the former shadow home secretary and veteran left-winger, who is a close ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, was only readmitted to the party last week. There was still uncertainty over whether she would be allowed to run as Labour’s candidate in her former seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington until Sir Keir said she would be free to stand for the party on Friday.

"Ban fossil fuel ads to save climate, says UN chief","By Matt McGrath",2024-06-05,"The world's fossil fuel industries should be banned from advertising to help save the world from climate change, the head of the United Nations said on Wednesday. UN Secretary General António Guterres called coal, oil and gas corporations the “godfathers of climate chaos” who had distorted the truth and deceived the public for decades. Just as tobacco advertising was banned because of the threat to health, the same should now apply to fossil fuels, he said. His remarks were his most damning condemnation yet of the industries responsible for the bulk of global warming. They came as new studies showed the rate of warming is increasing and that global heat records have continued to tumble. Data from the EU's climate service confirms that each of the past 12 months set a new global temperature record for the time of year. The high temperatures were driven by human-caused climate change, although they were also given a small  boost by the El Niño climate phenomenon. While a fading El Niño should soon bring a pause to the record-breaking sequence of months, temperatures will continue to rise in the long-term due to emissions of planet-warming gases from human activities. Last year was the hottest on record and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday that the record could fall again as soon as this year. A group of around 50 leading scientists separately reported that the rate of global warming caused by humans has continued to increase. They found that ongoing high emissions of warming gases mean the world is moving closer to breaching the symbolic 1.5C warming mark on a longer-term basis. To try to avert this outcome, the UN Secretary General has called for more rapid political action on climate change, and a “clampdown” on the fossil fuel industry. “We must directly confront those in the fossil fuel industry who have shown relentless zeal for obstructing progress – over decades.” He said many in the oil, gas and coal industries had “shamelessly greenwashed” with lobbying, legal action and massive advertising campaigns. “I urge every country to ban advertising from fossil fuel companies,” he told an audience in New York. “And I urge news media and tech companies to stop taking fossil fuel advertising.” In response, representatives of fossil fuel groups said they were committed to reducing their emissions. “Our industry is focused on continuing to produce affordable, reliable energy while tackling the climate challenge, and any allegations to the contrary are false,” said Megan Bloomgren, Senior Vice President of Communications at the American Petroleum Foundation. The UK Advertising Standards Authority has previously pledged to clamp down on misleading environmental claims, while the European Union recently announced a new law to tackle the problem. Mr Guterres' call for an outright ban on all fossil fuel advertising goes further - but it has no legal standing, and the UN has no means of enforcing the idea. However, it will be seen as a boost for campaigners who have fought against sponsorship and advertising from coal, oil and gas companies. Both the Hay and Edinburgh book festivals have recently suspended sponsorship from investment company Baillie Gifford following controversy over links to fossil fuel firms. Sport is one of the biggest areas of fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship, with football having a long association with oil and gas producers. Concerns over human health have seen alcohol and tobacco sponsorship banned in football in the past, and green campaigners will be hoping that the support of Mr Guterres will see fossil fuels go the same way. In his address, Mr Guterres stressed that time was of the essence, with the impacts of rising temperatures already being felt - such as the recent deadly heatwaves in Asia or the floods in South America. The record-breaking global heat means that average temperatures over the past 12 months have been 1.63C above ""pre-industrial levels"" of the late 1800s, according to Copernicus data. ""We are living in unprecedented times,"" says Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. This does not constitute a breach of the Paris climate agreement, in which nearly 200 countries pledged to try to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, in order to try to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change. That is because the Paris agreement is generally understood to mean a 20-year average - to smooth out natural variability. Taken as a whole, the past decade was about 1.2C warmer than pre-industrial levels. But a new study released today by a group of leading climate scientists highlighted how close the world is getting to a long-term breach of the 1.5C mark. They estimate that from the start of 2024 the world could only emit around 200 billion more tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) for a 50/50 chance of keeping warming to 1.5C - down from 500 billion tonnes at the beginning of 2020. At current rates of emissions, this ""carbon budget"" could be exhausted by 2029 - although the world would probably not pass the long-term 1.5C mark until a few years later, because of warming effects from greenhouse gases other than CO2. There are uncertainties about how exactly the climate system will react to these factors, and of course whether countries make urgent cuts to emissions. ""We have a bit of control over this as a society,"" says lead author Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds. Despite the gloom, there has been some recent progress, with particularly rapid growth in renewable wind and solar electricity. Greenhouse gas emissions are also showing signs of plateauing - but they are still at record highs. They need to fall quickly if global targets have a chance of being met, with every fraction of a degree of warming worsening climate impacts. ""Every degree matters; every tenth of a degree matters,"" says Ko Barrett, WMO Deputy Secretary General. ""The difference between 1.5C and say 2C could mean [...] dire consequences, for coastal communities, for fragile ecosystems, and the biodiversity that is contained within them, and for glaciers and the frozen parts of the world.""

"Who owns the Moon? A new space race means it could be up for grabs","By Rebecca Morelle",2024-06-08,"We’re in the midst of a Moon rush. A growing number of countries and companies  have the lunar surface in their sights in a race for resources and space dominance. So are we ready for this new era of lunar exploration? This week, images were beamed back to Earth of China’s flag unfurled on the Moon. It’s the country’s fourth landing there - and the first ever mission to return samples from the Moon’s far side. In the past 12 months, India and Japan have also set down spacecraft on the lunar surface. In February, US firm Intuitive Machines became the first private company to put a lander on the Moon, and there are plenty more set to follow. Meanwhile, Nasa wants to send humans back to the Moon, with its Artemis astronauts aiming for a 2026 landing. China says it will send humans to the Moon by 2030. And instead of fleeting visits, the plan is to build permanent bases. But in an age of renewed great-power politics, this new space race could lead to tensions on Earth being exported to the lunar surface. “Our relationship with the Moon is going to fundamentally change very soon,” warns Justin Holcomb, a geologist from the University of Kansas. The rapidity of space exploration is now “outpacing our laws”, he says. A UN agreement from 1967 says no nation can own the Moon. Instead, the fantastically named Outer Space Treaty says it belongs to everyone, and that any exploration has to be carried out for the benefit of all humankind and in the interests of all nations. While it sounds very peaceful and collaborative - and it is - the driving force behind the Outer Space Treaty wasn’t cooperation, but the politics of the Cold War. As tensions grew between the US and Soviet Union after World War Two, the fear was that space could become a military battleground, so the key part of the treaty was that no nuclear weapons could be sent into space. More than 100 nations signed up. But this new space age looks different to the one back then. One major change is that modern-day Moon missions are not just the projects of nations - companies are competing, too. In January, a US commercial mission called Peregrine announced it was taking human ashes, DNA samples and a sports drink, complete with branding, to the Moon. A fuel leak meant it never made it there, but it sparked debate about how delivering this eclectic inventory fitted in with the treaty’s principle that exploration should benefit all humanity. “We're starting to just send stuff up there just because we can. There's no sort of rhyme or reason anymore,” says Michelle Hanlon, a space lawyer and founder of For All Moonkind, an organisation that seeks to protect the Apollo landing sites. ""Our Moon is within reach and now we're starting to abuse it,” she says. But even if lunar private enterprise is on the increase, nation states still ultimately remain the key players in all this, Sa’id Mosteshar, director of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law, says any company needs to be authorised to go into space by a state, which will be limited by the international treaties. There’s still a great deal of prestige to be had by joining the elite club of Moon landers. After their successful missions, India and Japan could very much claim to be global space players. And a nation with a successful space industry can bring a big boost to the economy through jobs, innovation. But the Moon race offers an even bigger prize: its resources. While the lunar terrain looks rather barren, it contains minerals, including rare earths, metals like iron and titanium - and helium too, which is used in everything from superconductors to medical equipment. Estimates for the value of all this vary wildly, from billions to quadrillions. So it’s easy to see why some see the Moon as a place to make lots of money. However, it’s also important to note that this would be a very long-term investment -  and the tech needed to extract and return these lunar resources is a some way off. In 1979, an international treaty declared that no state or organisation could claim to own the resources there. But it wasn’t popular - only 17 countries are party to it, and this does not include any countries who’ve been to the Moon, including the US. In fact, the US passed a law in 2015 allowing its citizens and industries to extract, use and sell any space material. “This caused tremendous consternation amongst the international community,” Michelle Hanlon told me. “But slowly, others followed suit with similar national laws.” These included Luxembourg, the UAE, Japan and India. The resource that could be most in demand is a surprising one: water. “When the first Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts were analysed, they were thought to be completely dry,” explains Sara Russell, professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum. “But then a kind of revolution happened about 10 years ago, and we found out that they’ve got little traces of water in them trapped in phosphate crystals.” And at the Moon’s poles, she says, there’s even more - reserves of water ice are frozen inside permanently shadowed craters. Future visitors could use the water for drinking, it could be used to generate oxygen and astronauts could even use it to make rocket fuel, by splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen, allowing them to travel from the Moon to Mars and beyond. The US is now attempting to establish a new set of guiding principles around lunar exploration - and lunar exploitation. The so-called Artemis Accords state that extracting and using resources on the Moon should be done in a way complies with the Treaty for Outer Space, although it says some new rules might be needed. More than 40 countries have so far signed up to these non-binding agreements, but China is notably absent from the list. And some argue that new rules for lunar exploration shouldn’t be led by an individual nation. “This really ought to be done through the United Nations because it affects all countries,” Sa’id Mosteshar tells me. But access to resources could also cause another clash. While there’s plenty of room on the Moon, areas close to ice-filled craters are the prime lunar real estate. So what happens if everyone wants the same spot for their future base? And once a country has set one up, what’s to stop another nation establishing their base a bit too close? “I think there's an interesting analogy to the Antarctic,” says Jill Stuart, a space policy and law researcher at the London School of Economics. “We'll probably see research bases being set up on the Moon like they are on the continent.” But specific decisions about a new lunar base, for example whether it covers a few square kilometres or a few hundred, may come down to whoever gets there first. “There will definitely be a first-mover advantage,” Jill Stuart says. “So if you can get there first and set up camp, then you can work out the size of your zone of exclusion. It doesn’t mean you own that land, but you can sit on that space.” Right now, the first settlers are most likely to be either the US or China, bringing a new layer of rivalry to an already tense relationship. And they are likely to set the standard - the rules established by whoever gets there first may end up being the rules that stick over time. If this all sounds a bit ad hoc, some of the space experts I’ve spoken to think we’re unlikely to see another major international space treaty. The dos and don’ts of lunar exploration are more likely to be figured out with memorandums of understanding or new codes of conduct. There’s a lot at stake. The Moon is our constant companion, as we watch it wax and wane through its various phases as it glows bright in the sky. But as this new space race gets under way, we need to start thinking about what sort of place we want it to be - and whether it risks becoming a setting where very Earthly rivalries are played out.

"Crossbows and eerie silences – following Antarctic whales for climate change clues","By Victoria Gill",2024-06-08,"Inside the bodies of humpback whales are clues about how climate change is transforming Antarctica. Our BBC science team crossed the Southern Ocean, with the researchers, on a mission to follow and study the giant whales of this remote, frozen wilderness. At 03:00 in the morning there is an almighty crash. Every drawer in our cabin is flung open and contents hurled against the wall. We hit a 12-metre wave. I’m not a seafarer; this is alarming, but apparently not unusual on the Drake Passage - the stretch of the notoriously rough Southern Ocean we are on. We’re aboard a 200-passenger tourist ship, with a team of wildlife scientists, on our way to the Antarctic Peninsula. One of the researchers, Dr Natalia Botero-Acosta has an arresting piece of equipment in her hand luggage - a custom-made crossbow. “It’s not a weapon,” she explains. “It’s a scientific tool we use to collect whale skin and blubber samples.” Using the crossbow and a drone, the researchers will carry out up-close health checks on every humpback whale they can find, to work out if these massive mammals are getting enough to eat. It is an important question - not just for mighty, 40-tonne humpbacks that travel thousands of kilometres to gorge themselves in the cold seas - but for the health of the ocean and our planet. In the rich, freezing seas off the peninsula, penguins, seals and many whales feed on Antarctic krill. These diminutive, almost unimaginably numerous, shrimp-like creatures thrive under sea ice. As the climate warms up, scientists are racing to understand what that means for this ice-dependent food supply. Early on our first Antarctic morning, in mercifully calm coastal waters, we set out on a small, inflatable boat called a zodiac. Cloud is descending and it is starting to snow. Leading our Antarctic whale research mission is Chris Johnson, who is the wildlife charity WWF’s global expert on whale conservation. In conditions like this,” says Chris, “the best way to find whales is to listen - we’ll switch off the zodiac engine and close our eyes.” The silence is transformational. Multiple, overlapping blows of whale exhalations echo off mountains that rise vertically out of glassy water. Gigantic, hungry humpbacks are feeding in this bay. All around our small boat, animals are breathing, then diving - opening their cavernous mouths to let krill-laden seawater rush in. We head slowly in the direction of the nearest blows and Natalia reaches for her crossbow. The giant mammals build up chemical clues about their environment in their blubber - clues that Natalia plans to collect. She picks up one of the crossbow bolts. On the business end, there is a 3cm metal tip that plucks a piece of skin and blubber from the whale’s body. A rubber stopper prevents the bolt from penetrating further: It grabs a sample, then bounces off the animal and floats in the water. “It’s 3cm from an animal that’s 14m long - so it’s like a mosquito bite,” says Natalia. Sure enough, when her bolt takes a nick out of the body of a huge, female whale, the animal doesn’t flinch. It’s a mother, side-by-side with her calf. She seems intrigued - circling our boat slowly, then gliding directly underneath. Her giant head and white pectoral fins - fringed with barnacles - are visible as she slowly floats beneath us. “Hold on in case she comes up,” says Chris. But mother whale glides on, surfacing on the other side of us with a blow. The calf is even more curious, raising its head out of the water. The young marine mammal seems to examine us; we’re a strange group of tiny, terrestrial mammals in a small, rubber boat. I can’t stop myself greeting the calf: “Hello, beautiful.” Baby humpbacks spend a year nursing on their mothers’ rich milk. With a hungry, one-tonne newborn, calories are important. “We need to find the most critical feeding habitats for whales, so we can protect them,” explains Chris. The health of whales, he explains, shines a light on the health of the whole Antarctic ecosystem. And whales are physically necessary for a healthy ocean: Humpbacks eat krill, and krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice - plants that absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. Whales then poop (in vast quantities) and fertilise the marine plants. It’s a virtuous, productive cycle that climate change is disrupting. “These are natural processes we rely on for fresh air, food and clean water,” says Chris. “Places like this are important for all of us.” There is a group of humpbacks in this bay and Natalia sets up to take another biopsy. She seems in sync with the whale. When it arches its back above the surface, that’s the moment - and the ideal, blubber-rich area - for her to aim for. There’s a gentle “thunk” as the bolt bounces off the whale, taking its nugget of tissue. Back in her lab at the University of California Santa Cruz, Natalia will be able to tell if this whale was hungry, stressed or pregnant from chemical signals, or hormones, that build up in its blubber. “Pregnancy data is so valuable,’ Natalia says. “My colleague previously found that, in years when there is low sea ice, you have lower pregnancy rates. [We’re really seeing] the effect of climate change - and all these conservation threats - on the animals.” Most mature humpbacks here will eat about three million Antarctic krill each day, as they bulk up for a 8,000km journey back to breeding grounds in the tropical Pacific. While a single krill is just 6cm long fully-gown, collectively they weigh about 400 million tonnes. That is similar to the combined weight of every human on Earth. The swarms of krill here depend on sea ice - they graze on its algae and survive in its crevices. Marine ecologist Prof Angus Atkinson from Plymouth Marine Laboratory says climate change is a threat to krill. “Since 2017, there has been a worrying decline in Antarctic sea ice,” he says. In 2023, it reached a record low, with over 2 million sq km less ice than usual during winter. Another way the team is studying the whales here is from above - with a drone. The remotely controlled aerial cameras mean scientists can record spectacular displays of behaviour that can’t be seen from the surface. Chris launches his drone and we watch a group of humpbacks perform a perfect demonstration of bubble net feeding. Working together, they blow bubbles in a spiral, trapping the krill swarm. Like colossal, synchronised swimmers, they lunge through the middle of the bubble net open-mouthed. One whale creates a solo bubble net, then sweeps krill into its mouth with a huge fin. “It’s using its pectoral fin as a tool,” says Chris. The drone doesn’t just provide a spectacular view - it’s used to weigh the whales. Chris explains: “We measure the length and width of their bodies to work out how fat they’re getting during the season.” Scientists have seen evidence of whales “getting skinny” because of a climate-linked food shortages. One study of Southern right whales - that feed on krill, then migrate to the South African coast to give birth - showed that the animals are 20% thinner compared to 30 years ago. Krill are difficult to count and it isn’t clear if numbers are declining, but research has shown that the population is moving south into colder water. A regular check on humpbacks’ weight will provide more clues. Krill biologist Prof So Kawaguchi from the Australian Antarctic Division says it’s vital to understand the whole life cycle and the behaviour of krill. “If climate change affects the behaviour and distribution of the swarms, some predators are going to suffer,” he says. “Krill could move out of their reach.” Whales shrinking is an indicator of poor health, explains Chris. “There are multiple causes - climate change, fisheries, ship strikes and underwater noise pollution - it’s all adding up.” There is a krill fishery in the Southern Ocean. The oil is used in to make some animal feeds and supplements. Strict catch limits are designed to protect Antarctic wildlife, but the WWF wants some areas designated no fishing zones to protect whales’ food supply. “We’re advocating closing off really sensitive wildlife feeding habitats,” Chris explains. As Chris looks intently at his drone display, he suddenly calls out: “Mom’s pooping!” The aerial view shows a female humpback relaxing near our boat, right next to a large volume of floating faeces. Biologist Sarah Kienle grabs a large sample jar from the kit bag and leans over the side to scoop some up. The waste has the aroma of highly concentrated rotting fish, but Sarah is delighted. “Whale poop is so hard to find and it contains all this information about what they’re eating. We can even get DNA and hormones from it. It’s liquid, smelly gold!” Back aboard the ship, the team use a store room as a makeshift laboratory. At a small table, Natalia and Sarah take each sample from its arrow-tip casing and put it in a sealed tube to be transported back to Natalia’s lab. On the ship, the samples go into a freezer. On the long journey home though, Natalia travels with her samples tucked into a small, insulated picnic box. She often asks cabin crew on a flight for ice from the drinks cart to ensure her precious samples are kept as cold as possible. While working from a tourist ship has its limitations, it means the team can work in several sites around the peninsula. “Scientists and the tourists want to get to the same places - hotspots of biodiversity and animals,” explains Sarah, who has joined the team from Baylor University in Texas. The tour company, Intrepid, provides space and facilities for the scientists. For the team, Chris says, being on the ship means access to one of the most remote places on Earth. Tourism can leave its mark. The number of people who make the trip to Antarctica for a holiday has increased dramatically in recent years. In the season between 2022 and 2023, a record 104,000 people visited. Before the 1980s, just a few hundred people came each year. Antarctic adventures have a high carbon footprint, and any visitor - scientist, tourist or journalist - could unwittingly bring in seeds or microbes that do not belong on clothes or boots. Expedition guides on this trip actually vacuum out passengers' backpacks and pockets to help prevent that. Bobbles on hats are discouraged when ashore - they can shed fibres. But there is evidence that experiencing the frozen continent in person can inspire visitors to advocate for its protection. Working in this way also means researchers operate on the tourist ship’s schedule, with just four full days travelling around the Peninsula before heading back across the infamous Drake Passage. On the last day, two whales the team are following suddenly stop next to an iceberg and stop moving. “They’ve fallen asleep,” explains Natalia. Natalia approaches every animal with care. And she has the best chance to get a good sample from a moving whale - as it arches out of the water. “I’m going to put a bolt in the water, just to make a splash and see if it will wake them up,” she explains. Thunk. Splash. Nothing. “They didn’t move,” she smiles. “No reaction whatsoever. They’re very sleepy.” Finally, the two whales stir and Natalia takes her final shot to get one last, precious sample containing information about what is happening to this environment and the wildlife that depends on it. This is a place that humanity depends on too - a productive, icy ocean that helps cool our planet. Working out exactly how it is changing means monitoring it. So the scientists hope to return to this frozen wilderness next summer to keep up their regular health check in on its largest inhabitants. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Sunak's shocking week makes Tory election fight even tougher","By Laura Kuenssberg",2024-06-08,"“Very wrong.” “Crushing.” “He knows he has made a mistake and it’s a factor in the election campaign we didn’t want to have.” In public, that’s how Rishi Sunak’s cabinet colleagues have described his D-day blunder. In private, it’s even worse. One member of the cabinet told me it shows that Sunak “just has no idea how to do politics”. A senior party figure told me: “It feels like Michael Foot in a donkey jacket at the Cenotaph,” referring to the former Labour leader’s infamous attire in 1981. “It just makes your heart sink.” Another Tory source told of their disbelief at Sunak’s decision to leave the D-Day ceremonies early, claiming that “this is the worst political operation in modern Number 10 history”. There’s a different view from some of the PM’s allies, a committed group of people working as hard as they can in very tough circumstances. They have four - what might feel very long - weeks to go. A loyal minister says there are only two options now: “Lose your head or get on with the campaign.” In the frenzy of campaigns, just like in politics and life in general, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. This one is almost impossible to fathom. It wasn’t a split-second decision that went the wrong way, or a hot-mic moment like Gordon Brown’s grisly ""bigoted woman"" comment about Gillian Duffy back in 2010. It was a deliberate choice made in advance. Sunak’s decision to miss some of the ceremony was always likely to cause diplomatic offence and upset veterans. And from a campaigning point of view, he was turning down some of the most powerful images any candidate could dream of, to be seen alongside the American President, the Royal Family and military figures. His early departure meant he wasn't part of a photograph of world leaders. Instead Foreign Secretary David Cameron was pictured standing alongside President Biden, France's President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. It should have been a golden opportunity for the prime minister to project strength, particularly when the Conservatives are trying to portray Labour as weak on defence. “It was a no brainer,” one minister says. “Why not pick up the $100m bill on the floor?” A quick apology is just about the only aspect of affair that was not a disaster. The danger for the Conservatives now is not just that the D-day blunder colours the election conversation, but that fear and loathing inside the campaign bursts into the open. In the seven-party BBC debate last night, the saga gave the smaller parties a political gift - Nigel Farage blasted the PM for being “unpatriotic”. Sunak is, I’m told “genuinely remorseful” about what happened and has acted in government to try to help veterans, so this stings. But even before this, there were fears that Reform UK, under Farage’s leadership, could nudge past the Conservatives in polling, possibly in the next few days. “If Reform overtake [it] will lead to total panic,” a party source told me. No doubt Sunak’s early exit is particularly tricky because it’s likely to upset precisely those voters the Conservatives have been trying to entice back. All of the smaller parties, for whom it can be hard to get a word in edgeways, were able to hammer the Tories last night with what seemed genuine indignation. It was also noticeable that they are all assuming a Labour victory – indeed, they are trying to turn that projection to their campaigning advantage. The Greens, Plaid and the SNP all, in various ways, tried to portray themselves as the ones who can keep Labour honest, to hold the party to its left-wing roots and stop it becoming what they claim would be a softer pastiche of the Tories. One source told me: “It’s clear the smaller parties are the only challenge to Labour, and that’s part of their way into the debate. It’s clear the Tories aren’t winning so who holds Labour to account?” Indeed one senior Conservative source believes the share of the vote for the smaller parties is likely to be the highest it’s ever been this time round. Let’s see. My regular reminder: voters are volatile, and there is a long time left in this campaign. But as we talked about last week, if Labour wins, it might have to get used to much of the pressure coming from the broad left. Plaid and the SNP also both made positive arguments for immigration - a rare moment in politics in 2024. An SNP insider said their party “actually has something to say, breaking the conspiracy of silence on cuts, on Brexit and on migration too”. The Lib Dems - who are having the bounciest of campaigns – admit that for smaller parties, “the existential challenge is not that people don’t like your policies: it’s that people literally forget you exist”. Smaller parties sometimes have to be the fastest, the funniest, or the most controversial to cut through. There is no doubt in this general election, though, that smaller parties could hold a lot of sway. See how often Keir Starmer’s been campaigning in Scotland to try to humble the SNP. Or just ask Conservative MPs desperately worried about the Lib Dems and Reform. The big moves and big mistakes of the two big parties nearly always suck up most campaign oxygen. And the epic mistake this week has rattled Conservatives across the country, leading to questions about the campaign. One minister furiously wanted to know how on earth the team around Sunak had allowed him to make the mistake in the first place: “What is the point of Liam [Booth-Smith], or James [Forsyth], or Isaac [Levido] in a moment like this, if they don’t say, ‘you are insane, if you do this, I quit’.” It is worth saying that one of the challenges for any campaign when their leaders are in government is that they have time when they are off the trail and doing official business that you cannot control. But this feverish weekend, that defence is not likely to do much good. There are plenty of wider gripes about the operation. A senior Tory told me there are experienced advisers “sitting around” not being put to good use. “Donors are looking on in horror,” they said. There is yet to be the familiar letter from business leaders backing the party, and there are suggestions that money is tight. A former minister said that “there is no sign that Rishi and CCHQ will [get a] grip [of] the campaign” and the prospects are “uniformly bad”. Another source complained Rishi Sunak called the election having been warned there were problems inside the tent. “This was all so predictable,"" the source said. “Over a year ago specific complaints were made about CCHQ being totally incapable of supporting the parliamentary party, let alone fight an election campaign. Despite those complaints, no changes were made.” Others in party HQ say they have expanded the operation and increased the number of campaign managers over the past 18 months. A government insider pointed the finger at Sunak and his close team: “We have known for two years this was pure incompetence and arrogance. Now the whole world can see it.” Ouch! Any such problems are denied by others, who say the “team is holding together fine”. And yet - take a breath, repeat after me - there are still four weeks to run. One minister says that when they are knocking on doors, there are still undecided voters who can shift – another says “the polling feels worse than the doorsteps”. Next week we’ll see the party manifestoes - the Conservatives expected on Tuesday, and Labour on Thursday. They will be a total contrast. The Tories are presenting a longer and longer list of plans designed to appeal to their former core backers – but don’t expect a shopping list from Labour. They will put forward plans that are deliberately familiar, with a message of change and reform. No traditional big cheques for public services. The party top brass does not want to have a fight about how much money they will spend on public services, and will stick to making their case that the Conservatives have botched the economy. One source claims they can’t have an argument about how to slice up the pie of spending because “the problem we have in this country is the Tories have eaten all the pies and burnt down the kitchen too”. After the last few days, there is a challenge for the Tories to grapple back some of the agenda, to change the conversation away from the Normandy blunder. As the national campaign falters, some candidates tell me they are already shifting some of their plea to voters on the doorstep. Following the example of what one describes as “smarter Labour MPs in 2017”, they shift the message to: “There is going to be a landslide, surely you don’t want that, that’s not good for the country, and why would you want to lose your local champion?” It’s hard for Conservative politicians to say that explicitly in public, as it acknowledges their rivals are on course to win big. But a party campaign source acknowledged they’d be trying to “warn people about what a big Labour majority would do”. Some of the party’s online content is already talking about “holding Labour to account” – the implication of that, of course, is a tacit acknowledgement they’re likely to win. But in political times, the election is practically years away. Remember too, last weekend it was Labour on the back foot, grappling to contain rows about candidates and the veteran MP Diane Abbott. Rishi Sunak has had a shocker this week – but a hopeful member of the government told me that “Keir Starmer might have a bad day. A member of the shadow cabinet might say something completely idiotic… so we can either just start ripping our own hair out and talking about how awful it is or trying to get on with fighting an election.” But there is no doubt that after the last 48 hours, fighting that election has become harder.

"Fish deaths at pub prompt pond warning","By Samantha Noble",2024-05-31,"Staff at a pub in Derbyshire are urging visitors to stop throwing coins and litter into its pond after three koi carp died in the last five months. Notices have been put up at The Fishpond, in Matlock Bath, warning that every coin thrown into the pond ""contaminates the water and kills our fish"". Liley Henderson-Hirst, the pub's events manager, said: ""It's a plea really - we just want to save our fish because we love them, and our customers love them."" Rob Whittell, chairman of The British Koi-Keepers Society, told the BBC: ""Any metals are not good for carp."" Ms Henderson-Hirst said there was about £130 worth of coins in the water when the pond was last cleared out two months ago. She said a koi specialist told staff that the chemicals in the coins were killing the fish. But staff are finding more than just coins in the pond, Ms Henderson-Hirst said. They have found ""all sorts"" in the water previously, she added, and said that people putting things in the pond had ""got worse recently"". Ms Henderson-Hirst said staff checked the pond for litter every night and tried to remove items ""as fast as possible"". She added: ""We have had notices on the wall throughout the years but we have had to put more round the pond."" Ms Henderson-Hirst said the fish were getting an illness called koi pox, and developing ulcers on their skin. Pub staff have been putting a treatment in the pond which they said was recommended by the specialist they had spoken to. Ms Henderon-Hirst said of the five fish left, one had a little sore but the others looked ""really healthy"". ""Hopefully we’ve stopped it with this treatment,"" she added. Mr Whittell told the BBC that the coins could have been a contributing factor to the deaths of the fish. He said: ""Copper is not ideal and is toxic to fish. ""In fact any metals can cause problems."" However, he said there was ""not always a single cause"". ""We would ask that you don’t throw anything into koi ponds, simple dipping your hands should also be avoided,"" he added. Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

"Will using Western weapons on Russia help Ukraine change the war?","By Abdujalil Abdurasulov",2024-06-01,"Ukraine is now allowed to use Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia. What will this decision change and how will it affect the front line in Ukraine? Up until now, Western countries restricted the use of their weapons to military targets located inside Ukraine, including Crimea and occupied territories. They were concerned that attacking targets across the internationally recognised border with weapons provided by Nato countries would escalate the conflict. But the latest Russian advance in the north-eastern Kharkiv region convinced Kyiv’s allies that in order to defend itself, Ukraine must be able to destroy military targets on the other side of the border as well. Last month, Russia launched a massive ground assault in the region, opening a new front and capturing several villages. The Russian advance posed a serious threat to Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which is just 30km away from the border. The border in this region is effectively the front line as well, so the ban on using Western weapons to hit targets beyond Ukraine enabled Russian troops to prepare for that operation in a safe environment. Following the growing pressure from Ukraine and other European states, the US agreed to change its policy and allow Kyiv to strike Russia with Western weapons. “The hallmark of our engagement has been to adapt and adjust as necessary, to meet what’s actually going on on the battlefield, to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, when it needs it,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague on Friday. Just a few days before this announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand “sanitary zones” in case Western long-range weapons are used to strike the Russian territory. He said that Nato countries in Europe must remember that they have “states with small territories and dense population”. “They must take this factor into consideration prior to discussing strikes deep inside the Russian territory,” he added. Avoiding an escalation is probably the reason why the US didn’t include long-range weapons such as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) in its permission to strike Russia. These missiles have a range of 300km and could be used to hit military bases and airfields well into Russian territory. Such limitations leave Ukraine with only the option of focusing on targets near its border.  But this is still a major policy shift by Kyiv’s main allies. Even with a shorter range - up to 70km - multiple rocket launchers such as HIMARS can significantly disrupt Russian logistics operations and troops movement, which will ultimately slow down any offensive plans. Now, Ukraine can “strike places where the enemy concentrated its troops, equipment and supply storage facilities that are used to attack Ukraine,” says Yuriy Povkh from the Kharkiv tactical group that co-ordinates military operations in the north-east. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia was gathering its troops just 90km from Kharkiv for another offensive. And the Institute for Study of War analysed satellite images and confirmed that there were “expanded activities at depots and warehouses” in that area.  So the ability to target those facilities will seriously strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian forces to repel new attacks in the region. Lifting the ban on Western weapons, however, is unlikely to help to protect Ukraine from Russian glide bombs known locally as KAB. They have a devastating effect and are regularly used to bomb Kharkiv and other border towns.  But to stop such attacks, Ukrainian forces must target planes that drop those deadly KABs. The only weapon capable of intercepting those planes that Ukraine has at its disposal at this moment is the US air-defence system Patriot.  However, getting this weapon close to Kharkiv is a huge risk.  Spy drones can quickly spot it and Moscow can launch missiles such as Iskander to destroy this expensive system. Interestingly, the UK and France, which provide Ukraine with jointly made Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles (or Scalp as they are called in France), haven’t explicitly restricted their use.  And their range can go up to 250km. In fact, French President Emanuel Macron told journalists last week:“We should allow [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.” And such rhetoric is seen as permission to use Storm Shadows/Scalps, a military aviation officer who prefers to remain anonymous, told the BBC.  So, he says, Ukraine can now hit airfields in the Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine. However, such operations will be limited in terms of what they can achieve. Ukrainian Su-24s that are equipped with these cruise missiles will have to get close to the Russian border in order to launch them, which makes them vulnerable to Russian air defence systems. F-16 jets that are expected by the end of this year are better equipped for such tasks.  But President Zelensky admits that it’s still not clear whether Ukraine’s partners will allow these jets to be used to attack targets in Russia. “I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time,” he said at the Nordic summit in Stockholm on Friday. Ukrainian forces are trying to develop their own weapons to hit targets in Russia’s rear.  Some of their drones have attacked oil depots and military facilities hundreds of kilometres away from the border. The latest attack was on a long-range radar station in the city of Orsk, which is 1800km from the Ukrainian border. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Just Stop Oil pair guilty over Crucible protest",NA,2024-05-10,"A Just Stop Oil activist who jumped on a table during the World Snooker Championships and covered it with orange powder has been found guilty of criminal damage. Edred Whittingham, 26, disrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on April 17, 2023 He was found guilty of causing criminal damage after a one-day trial at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Friday, A fellow protester, 53-year-old Margaret Reid, who tried to do the same thing on the theatre's other table, was convicted of attempting to cause criminal damage. A video clip played to the court showed Whittingham, known as Eddie, releasing the orange substance, which he said was dyed corn starch powder, and kneeling amid the balls on the table before being hauled off by security. The defendant told the court he believed his actions were ""reasonable and proportionate in the light of the greater threat we are facing from the climate crisis"". Whittingham, from Exeter, said: ""I didn't intend to cause damage, I intended to cause disruption."" Reid, a former museum worker, also denied trying to cause damage, saying she ""set out to draw attention to the dire situation that we are in"". ""We need shaking out of our stupor,"" she told the court. ""We need a shock. We need an action like we took to make us jump out of the pan."" Reid, from Kendal, in Cumbria, said she has protested ""politely"" in the past, voted and written to her MP but ""it hasn't worked"". Whittingham's actions caused £899.90 worth of damage to the table, the court heard. Completion of the first-round match was delayed until the following day as a result. Reid's attempts to disrupt the match on the other table, on which Mark Allen and Fan Zhengyi were playing, were foiled when she was tackled by referee Olivier Marteel. Both will be sentenced at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on 10 July. Max Hinchcliffe, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the pair ""showed an utter lack of thought or care for the players at the tournament or the fans watching from across the world"". He added: ""The law upholds the right to protest but this must be balanced against the rights of others and this case shows that when lawful protest crosses the line into criminality we won't hesitate to prosecute offenders.""

"Magna Carta case damaged by Just Stop Oil protesters at British Library","By Harry Low",2024-05-10,"Two Just Stop Oil protesters have been arrested after damaging the case around the Magna Carta at the British Library. Reverend Sue Parfitt, 82, and Judy Bruce, 85, a retired biology teacher, targeted the glass enclosure around the historic document on Friday. The pair then held up a sign reading ""The Government is breaking the law"" before gluing themselves to the display, footage posted online shows. The British Library said security had ""intervened to prevent further damage"". The Metropolitan Police said two people had been taken into custody having been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage. The British Library said the damage to the case, which was caused at about 10:40 BST, was ""minimal"" and police said the document itself was not harmed. Rev Parfitt, who held a chisel while Ms Bruce used a hammer, said: ""The Magna Carta is rightly revered, being of great importance to our history, to our freedoms and to our laws. ""But there will be no freedom, no lawfulness, no rights, if we allow climate breakdown to become the catastrophe that is now threatened."" She added: ""We must get things in proportion.

"Is Labour's 2030 green energy goal realistic and how would it affect bills?","By Ben Chu",2024-05-31,"Keir Starmer's proposals for a publicly-owned company called Great British Energy to invest in clean and renewable energy are a central plank of Labour’s plans to almost entirely remove fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030, five years earlier than current government plans. But there are two criticisms of this goal. The first comes from the Conservatives, who argue that this rapid decarbonisation timetable will push up households’ energy bills. The second comes from some energy analysts who simply don’t think electricity decarbonisation as soon as 2030 is practically achievable. So are these criticisms fair? There’s no question that the Labour target is highly ambitious. According to estimates from Aurora Energy (who were commissioned by the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange to carry out the research), it would require the total installed UK offshore wind generating capacity to more than triple over the next six years. Solar electricity generation and onshore wind generating capacity would need to roughly double. This would be to replace the electricity currently provided by gas-fired power stations. Most energy experts agree decarbonisation will, in the longer term, be good for household energy bills because the UK would be less reliant on imported and internationally traded natural gas and oil for generating power - fossil fuels whose prices can be extremely volatile. The massive spike in UK households’ bills in recent years has mainly reflected the surge in European wholesale gas prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the choking off of gas supplies to the entire continent.  However, the up-front investment in new solar panels and wind turbines required for the UK to decarbonise, in the short and medium term, will come at a cost - and that could well be reflected in households’ bills. This is a cost that would materialise under the Conservatives’ policy of decarbonising electricity generation by 2035 too, of course. But all else being equal, a faster decarbonisation effort would mean those costs being passed on faster. Yet all else might not be equal. If there were to be another 2022-style global fossil-fuel price shock at some point over the next decade it might be the case that UK households will prove better off financially by moving to renewable energy more quickly. So in terms of how much a faster electricity decarbonisation might cost - or save - households it’s not very credible to put a cash figure on it. Labour is claiming their plan would save households £300 by 2030. But the reality is that it would heavily depend on what happens to fossil fuel prices over the coming years. On the second criticism, that electricity decarbonisation can’t be done by 2030, the reality is that experts are divided. Some, such as Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, who was commissioned to produce a cost of energy review for the UK government in 2017, insist Labour’s target is “unachievable”. But Chris Stark, the former chief executive of the government’s Independent Climate Change Committee, says that while it would take a “Herculean effort” it could, just about, be done. One of the biggest (and underappreciated) obstacles in terms of hitting the 2030 target is not the cost of installing new solar panels and wind turbines, but the practical difficulty - due to planning regulations and local opposition - of upgrading the UK’s electricity grid network. The grid is made up of the pylons and cables and substations needed to transmit electricity around the UK from the power stations and wind and solar farms where it is generated to the households and businesses who use it. Under Labour’s plans it’s estimated that total UK electricity capacity would need to almost double by 2030. This additional capacity would be required to provide electricity, among other things, for new electric heat pumps to warm peoples’ homes (replacing gas-fired boilers) and also the electric cars (replacing petrol and diesel vehicles) that people are expected to be driving in the coming years. Meeting that surge in demand for electricity will require a vast grid infrastructure construction effort. As the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, put it last year: “We must invest in grids today or face gridlock tomorrow.” BBC Verify brings together journalists and experts from across BBC News.

"Luxury perfumes linked to child labour, BBC finds","By Ahmed ElShamy and Natasha Cox",2024-05-28,"Children have picked ingredients used by suppliers to two major beauty companies, the BBC can reveal. A BBC investigation into last summer's perfume supply chains found jasmine used by Lancôme and Aerin Beauty's suppliers was picked by minors. All the luxury perfume brands claim to have zero tolerance on child labour. L'Oréal, Lancôme's owner, said it was committed to respecting human rights. Estée Lauder, Aerin Beauty's owner, said it had contacted its suppliers. The jasmine used in Lancôme Idôle L'Intense - and Ikat Jasmine and Limone Di Sicilia for Aerin Beauty - comes from Egypt, which produces about half the world's supply of jasmine flowers - a key perfume ingredient. Industry insiders told us the handful of companies that own many luxury brands are squeezing budgets, resulting in very low pay. Egyptian jasmine pickers say this forces them to involve their children. And we have discovered the auditing systems the perfume industry uses to check on supply chains are deeply flawed. The UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, Tomoya Obokata, said he was disturbed by the BBC World Service's evidence, which includes undercover filming in Egyptian jasmine fields during last year's picking season. ""On paper, they [the industry] are promising so many good things, like supply chain transparency and the fight against child labour. Looking at this footage, they are not actually doing things that they promised to do."" Heba - who lives in a village in the district of Gharbia, the heart of Egypt's jasmine region - wakes her family at 03:00 to begin picking the flowers before the sun's heat damages them. Heba says she needs her four children - aged from 5 to 15 - to help. Like most jasmine pickers in Egypt, she is what is known as an ""independent picker"" and works on a smallholder farm. The more she and her children can pick, the more they earn. On the night we filmed her, she and her children managed to pick 1.5kg of jasmine flowers. After paying a third of her earnings to the land owner, she was left with roughly US$1.5 [£1.18] for that night's work. This is worth less than ever before, given inflation in Egypt is at an all-time high, and pickers are often living below the poverty line. Heba's 10-year-old daughter Basmalla has also been diagnosed with a severe eye allergy. At a medical consultation we attended with her, the doctor told her that her vision will be affected if she continues jasmine picking without treating the inflammation. Once the jasmine has been picked and weighed, it is transferred via collection points to one of several local factories which extract oil from the flowers - the main three being A Fakhry and Co, Hashem Brothers and Machalico. Each year, it is the factories that set the price for the jasmine picked by people like Heba. It is difficult to say exactly how many of the 30,000 people involved in Egypt's jasmine industry are children. But during the summer of 2023 the BBC filmed across this region and spoke to many residents who told us the low price for jasmine meant they needed to include their children in their work. We witnessed that, at four different locations, a significant number of pickers working on smallholder farms - which supply the main factories - were children under the age of 15. Multiple sources also told us that there were children working on farms directly owned by the Machalico factory, so we went undercover to film there and found pickers who told us their ages ranged from 12 to 14. It is illegal for anyone under the age of 15 to work in Egypt between the hours of 19:00 and 07:00. The factories export the jasmine oil to international fragrance houses where the perfumes are created. Givaudan, based in Switzerland is one of the largest, and has a longstanding relationship with A Fakhry and Co. But it is the perfume companies above them - which include L'Oréal and Estée Lauder - which hold all the power, according to independent perfumer Christophe Laudamiel and several other industry insiders. Known as ""the masters"", they set the brief and a very tight budget for the fragrance houses, he said. ""The masters' interest is to have the cheapest oil possible to put in the fragrance bottle,"" and then to sell it at the highest possible price, said Mr Laudamiel, who spent years working inside one of the fragrance houses. ""They actually don't govern the salary or the wages of the harvesters, nor the actual price of jasmine, because they are beyond that,"" he explained. But he said that because of the budget that they set, the pressure on wages ""trickles down"" - to the factories, and ultimately, the pickers. ""There's a big disconnect between the preciousness that is talked about in the marketing talk, and what is actually given to the harvesters,"" he added. In their promotional material, the perfume companies and fragrance houses paint a picture of ethical sourcing practices. Every employer in the supply chain has also signed a letter of commitment to the UN, pledging to abide by its guidelines regarding safe working practices and eliminating child labour. The issue, according to a senior executive with fragrance house Givaudan, is the lack of oversight the perfume companies have of their supply chains. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the executive said these companies relied on the fragrance houses to instruct third-party auditing companies to check for due diligence. Perfume's Dark Secret Top perfume brands may have ""worst form of child labour"" in their supply chain, a BBC Eye investigation reveals. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). For international audiences, watch on YouTube Perfume's Dark Secret BBC Eye Investigations has discovered that, when the sun goes down in Egypt, there is a hidden human cost to this industry. Listen now on BBC Sounds The auditing firms most often mentioned by the conglomerates and fragrance houses on their websites, and in letters to the UN, are Sedex and UEBT. Their audit reports are not publicly available but by posing as a buyer looking for ethically sourced jasmine, we managed to get the factory A Fakhry and Co to send both of them to us. The report from UEBT, based on a visit to the factory last year, shows there was an indication of a human rights issue, but it doesn't go into detail. Despite this, the company was given a ""verification"", which means it can say it offers ""responsibly sourced jasmine oil"". UEBT, in its response to this, said: ""One company has been issued a responsible sourcing attestation, subject to an action plan… valid till mid 2024, and will be withdrawn if… not implemented."" The Sedex report gave the factory a glowing assessment, but it was clear from its write-up that the visit had been pre-announced, and only the factory site itself had been audited, and not the smallholder farms it sourced jasmine from. Sedex told us that it was ""firmly against all forms of labour rights abuses. But no one tool alone can or should be relied on to uncover and remediate all environmental and human rights risks or impacts."" Lawyer Sarah Dadush, founder of the Responsible Contracting Project, which seeks to improve human rights in global supply chains, said the BBC's investigation ""reveals… that those systems aren't working"". The issue, she said, is that ""the auditors are only auditing what they're paid to audit"", and this might not include the price paid to the labour force - ""a major root cause"" of child labour. A Fakhry and Co told us that child labour is prohibited in both its farm and factory, but that the vast majority of its jasmine is sourced from independent collectors. ""In 2018, under the monitoring of the UEBT, we commenced the Jasmine Plant Protection Products Mitigation Project, which imposes a prohibition on individuals under the age of 18 working on the farms."" It added that ""by any comparable standards in Egypt, jasmine picking is well-remunerated"". Machalico said it does not use pickers under the age of 18, and said it had increased the price it pays for jasmine for the past two years, and will do so again this year. Hashem Brothers said our report was ""based on misleading information"". Givaudan, the fragrance house which makes Lancôme Idôle L'Intense, described our investigation as ""deeply alarming"", adding ""it's incumbent upon us all to continue taking action to remove the risk of child labour entirely"". Firmenich, the fragrance house which makes Ikat Jasmine and Limone Di Sicilia for Aerin Beauty, and in summer 2023 sourced jasmine from Machalico, told us it was now using a new supplier in Egypt. It added that it will ""support initiatives that seek to collectively address this issue with industry partners and local jasmine farmers"". We also put the findings of the investigation to the perfume masters. L'Oréal said it was ""actively committed to respecting the most protective internationally recognised human rights standards"", adding that it ""never request[s] Fragrance Houses to go lower than the market price for ingredients at the expense of farmers. Despite our strong commitments… we know that in certain parts of the world where L'Oréal suppliers operate there are risks to our commitments being upheld."" It added: ""Whenever an issue arises, L'Oréal works proactively to identify the underlying causes and the way to resolve the issue. In January 2024, our partner performed an on-site human rights impact assessment to identify potential human rights violations and find ways to prevent and mitigate them, with a focus on the child labour risks."" L'Oréal has provided the BBC with an additional statement: ""L'Oréal is seeking to ensure that decent wages are paid to the farmers, that their children have access to education, and human rights laws, policies and practices are in place to stop children from working. ""Ahead of this year's harvest in June, a detailed action plan is in place with suppliers and our teams will be in Egypt evaluating their success."" Estée Lauder said: ""We believe the rights of all children should be protected. And we have contacted our suppliers to investigate this very serious matter. We recognise the complex socio-economic environment surrounding the local jasmine supply chain, and we are taking action to gain better transparency and to work toward improving the livelihoods of sourcing communities."" Back in Gharbia, jasmine picker Heba was shocked when we told her the price perfume was selling for on the international market. ""People here are worth nothing,"" she said.

"Move to extend police protest powers ruled unlawful","By Paul Seddon",2024-05-21,"An attempt by the government to widen police powers over protests has been ruled unlawful by the High Court. Legislation introduced last year under ex-home secretary Suella Braverman gave officers more leeway to stop disruption. But now two judges have ruled it did not have a proper legal basis, and the Home Office failed to consult properly on it. The department said it was ""disappointed"" and would be appealing. An accelerated appeal process will now take place, with an order quashing the legislation put on hold. The Home Office said it would ""consider all other options to keep this important power for police"". The timing of the ruling is awkward for ministers, who are considering new police powers to curtail pro-Palestinian marches. Campaign group Liberty, which brought the case, has called for police to refrain from using the powers until the appeal has been heard. In a statement, it called the ruling a ""victory for democracy"" that showed the government ""cannot step outside of the law to do whatever it wants"". The regulations, passed by MPs in June last year, lowered the threshold for what protest activity counts as ""serious disruption"" in England and Wales. It said any disruption that was ""more than minor"" should count - but campaigners argued this would give too much power to police. An official assessment of the law estimated the new definition could increase police intervention at protests by up to 50%. The move, announced amid the backdrop of disruptive protests by groups such as Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain, was controversial at the time. This was in part because the changes had already been rejected in the House of Lords six months before that. In a 56-page ruling, Lord Justice Green and Mr Justice Kerr said the legal basis underpinning the new powers was insufficient. It also said the Home Office had acted unlawfully by only asking police forces what they thought of the powers, rather than consulting more widely with the public and groups that might be affected. It comes as ministers consider recommendations from the government's adviser on political violence for tighter rules on public protests. In a report, Lord Walney, the former Labour MP John Woodcock, said it should be easier for police forces to ban demonstrations. He said this should include where they reasonably believe protests could lead to ""intimidation from threatening or abusive conduct"". He also suggested groups holding a ""significant number of large demonstrations"" could be asked to pay towards policing costs, and businesses affected by disruption should be able to get compensation. In a statement, Home Secretary James Cleverly said ministers would look at his recommendations ""over the coming weeks"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Jeremy Bowen: Ukraine faces its worst crisis since the war began","By Jeremy Bowen",2024-05-28,"Summer is just starting in Ukraine, and it is looking dangerous. Kharkiv, the country’s second city, in the high north-east close to Russia, is to all intents and purposes defenceless against air attacks. Two guided bombs destroyed a DIY superstore and garden centre on Saturday afternoon when it was crowded with shoppers. As the building burned, sending black smoke across Kharkiv, Andrii Kudenov, manager of one of the other stores in the shopping centre looked on in despair. “The Russians want to burn everything down. But we won’t give up.” “A lot of people were in there as it’s warm now and the gardening season has begun. In the shop there was soil, and plants.” Andrii took out his mobile and scrolled through photos of the superstore before the attack. “Look what beautiful flowers they had here. And not a single military man, everyone was a civilian.” Dozens were injured and at least 15 people were confirmed killed, with more bodies left to find. In every war, civilians try to preserve traces of their old lives. As the garden centre burned, couples walked their dogs. In the magnificent squares in the centre of Kharkiv, cafes were open, ignoring air raid sirens and alerts on mobile apps. On the steps of the opera house teenage boys practised jumps on their skateboards and girls were recording TikTok dances on their phones. Inside the opera house, in a deep concrete basement, an orchestra was rehearsing for the music festival that the war has not stopped. Their stoic composure cannot conceal the fact that Ukraine is in its worst crisis since the first few months after Russia’s full-scale invasion more than two years ago. The garden centre attack was one of many strikes here in the north east, as well as on the eastern front, and south near Kherson. Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself depends on others, on decisions taken by its Western allies that are shaping events here in Kharkiv and other cities, and right along more than 1,000km (621 miles) of front line. The other strategic factor that is changing the course of the war is Russia’s ability to learn and adapt on the battlefield. It is configuring attacks to take advantage of Ukrainian weakness, especially in air defences. Its factories are producing more weapons and ammunition than much bigger and more advanced Western economies are doing for Ukraine. Hopes in the first year of fighting that Russia could be driven back have turned into a grim struggle to stop its forces advancing deeper into the country. In the war’s third year, no end is in sight. Russian President Vladimir Putin expected a quick victory when he ordered the full-scale invasion in February 2022. So did Nato, led by the United States. President Volodymyr Zelensky turned down their offer of evacuation. Both the Kremlin and the Pentagon and the other Nato defence ministries expected that Russia would finish the job it started in 2014, when it occupied and annexed the Crimean Peninsula and orchestrated a victory by separatists in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine’s armed forces had improved on a dismal showing in 2014, but after a successful intervention in the war in Syria, Russia just looked too strong. The prediction as Russian troops poured into Ukraine in February 2022 was that Ukraine’s best chance to keep fighting would be to organise an insurgency, armed by Nato. Russia captured a deep stretch of Ukrainian territory, a ""land-bridge"" to link Donbas in the east with Crimea in the south. But its attempt to seize Kyiv was a humiliating fiasco for President Putin. By the end of March 2022, the battle for the capital was lost and the Kremlin pulled its troops back. Nato recognised that Ukraine could fight. It revealed itself as an unexpectedly useful ally, worthy of more support, providing a welcome set of new options in the growing face-off with Putin’s Russia. Slowly, Ukraine was sent increasingly powerful weapons. Overcoming US President Joe Biden’s reservations remains a painful process. He feared a third world war if the US and Nato intervened with their own troops, or even if they supplied Ukraine with its most up-to-date military technology. President Biden was persuaded to allow the supply of elderly American-built F-16 strike aircraft that were being retired by Nato air forces. They have not yet been deployed in combat, allowing Russia’s air force more space to attack. Most Western analysts think President Putin is bluffing when he rattles the nuclear sabre. China, Russia’s essential ally, has made it clear it does not want any use of nuclear weapons. The last thing it needs is a nuclear arms race in East Asia. In the Western camp, Japan and South Korea, if they felt threatened enough to change their policies, both have the technological capacity to make nuclear weapons. Joe Biden still does not want to call Vladimir Putin’s bluff. The US continues to impose limits on the use of weapons systems it supplies, forbidding the Ukrainians to hit targets inside Russia. President Zelensky believes that ruling ties one arm firmly behind their backs and is pushing to get it changed. But by last summer, an impressive force including a collection of modern Western tanks and armoured vehicles had been assembled and Nato had trained thousands of soldiers on ranges from the Baltic to Yorkshire. The plan was to mount an offensive that would smash through Russian lines, breaking the link between Donbas and Crimea. It failed. Russian defences were too strong, and without air cover an attempt to fight a Nato-style co-ordinated ‘all-arms’ war was doomed. Ukraine’s inherent weakness is that it depends on others for funding and arms. It faces an enemy that makes most of its own weapons and has many more people. Russia’s population of more than 140 million is around three-and-a-half times Ukraine’s. That matters in a war where battle deaths are in the tens of thousands. In the US, domestic politics intervened. Joe Biden’s request for a ""security supplemental"" that included $60bn (£47bn) for Ukraine was held up in the US Congress for months, mostly by supporters of Donald Trump who wanted the money to deal with matters closer to home, especially illegal immigration over the southern border with Mexico. The supplemental was only signed into law by President Biden on 24 April. Even the US military’s considerable logistics capability will take months to restock Ukraine’s arsenals, at a time when Moscow is producing weapons and shells as fast as it can, in an economy redesigned for a long war. “This is a war of production” according to a senior official at Nato headquarters in Belgium. “Russia is outproducing us in those things we know Ukraine needs.” Western sanctions failed to cripple Russia’s economy. It has found new markets for its oil and gas. Russia is buying drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea. China, Nato believes, is not directly providing lethal aid, but it is helping Russia in other ways. “There’s no doubt China is materially contributing to the Russian war effort,” the senior Nato official told me. “It’s rebuilding the defence industrial base, making a real difference.” “Machine tools and microelectronics come from China and go direct to strengthening the defence industries, so they churn out more tanks and missiles.” “One of the huge geostrategic implications of the changing relationship between China and Russia is that China will never again be the junior partner.” The kindergarten was on fire when Vika Pisna drove down a dirt road into the hamlet of Yurchenkove, north-east of Kharkiv city and close enough to the Russian border to feel very dangerous. Vika, who is a psychologist with a group called Proliska, has spent a year going into front-line villages threatened by Russia to evacuate civilians. No children were in the kindergarten. Yurchenkove, like all the border villages, had only a few elderly or infirm civilians. The kindergarten must have been abandoned months ago. Grass was advancing across the slides and toys in the overgrown front garden. A man on a motorbike loaded with a bedroll and few possessions, who looked as if he was leaving too, said he didn’t know how the fire was caused, but it wasn’t a shell. Whatever started it, no-one in the deserted, desolate village tried to put the fire out, as it licked and crackled through the kindergarten’s wooden walls and tin roof. Russia has been on the offensive in the Kharkiv oblast, or province, since its forces crossed the border on 10 May. President Putin said the plan was to establish a buffer zone, to protect civilians in Belgorod, the Russian city on their side of the border, where he says Ukraine is killing civilians. The offensive extends the active front line, forcing Ukraine to reinforce the Kharkiv sector, leaving holes elsewhere which Russia might try to exploit. We followed Vika and her minibus into the border area, staying well clear of Vovchansk, the frontier town at the centre of the current fighting that is being reduced to rubble. Even from a few miles away, it looked like a hell-hole, with angry grey clouds and columns of smoke rising high from a series of big fires, and black smoke spiralling and twisting into the sky from fresh explosions. Liubov, the first woman on Vika’s list was ready to leave. Her dog, chained near its kennel in the front yard, barked at the strangers as Vika helped her carry out her possessions, packed into a few shopping bags. The dog calmed down as the woman unchained it and took it into the minibus. “I encourage them to bring their pets,” Vika said. “When you lose everything, having a pet is a comfort.” “My soul hurts. I’ve lived in this house for more than 40 years,” Liubov said, squashed into the bus with her dog and her luggage. Was she leaving because of the shelling? “Of course! It was so close, less than 100 metres. All my windows blew out.” Vika could not persuade the next people she called on to evacuate. She banged on a solid metal gate. An old woman opened it a crack. “Good afternoon, are you Emma?” Vika asked. When Emma and her husband, somewhere inside out of sight, refused to go, Vika tried to change their minds. “Yesterday there was shelling near you. It’s very dangerous. You are putting yourself in danger. We have volunteers, who will help you move in, they will help you apply for benefits, medications and everything else. It will all be free. And you’ll have psychological assistance.” “Thank you! Thank you for everything, but I won't go.” “Look, we’re evacuating people because it’s a critical moment. If you want, you can return. But now, it is very dangerous here, with shelling every hour or two. It’s better to leave. There will be more shelling, and more hits. It’s dangerous here.” “I know.” “It's free! You’ll get free housing.’ “I won’t go.” Emma closed the gate. A body bag was being carried out of the remains of a burning print factory less than an hour after Russia hit it with a series of missiles on the afternoon of the 23 May. Seven people were killed in the attack. Ukraine is having to make hard choices about how it deploys and uses its limited air defences. The missiles that hit the printing plant were not intercepted. Nor was a Russian drone that was operating above the factory before, after and during the attack. In the yard, as firefighters went into the building to damp down the blaze and search for more bodies, Volodymyr Tymoshko, head of the Kharkiv oblast police, could barely contain his anger. “All missiles hit their target. They weren't shot down. Why? Because the arrival time of missiles from the Belgorod region is approximately 40 seconds. Those missiles can only be shot down by the Patriot air defence system, which we don’t have here.” He called Russia ‘the sub-empire of vandals and orcs... the resident evil.” Days later Olena Lupak, one of the workers at the printing plant, was still being treated in hospital for her wounds. Much of her visible skin was showing visible wounds from shrapnel and blast and her hair was singed where it had caught fire. Olena believes her life was saved by pallets of printed paper that took the worst of the explosion. She was emotional, sobbing then trying to smile, traumatised by everything that has happened to her. “I wasn’t afraid of anything at all, but now I’m even afraid to be in Kharkiv. I still hoped that Russia was not a terrorist state and that they attacked only military targets, but they hit the civilians.” “I thank the United States for helping us. I’m grateful to Germany and all the countries of the world for what they’ve done. But we are helpless, and we have nothing. We’re suffering so much… we can’t defend ourselves.” Ukraine is not as badly off as Olena Lupak fears, though it is understandable to feel that way in Kharkiv this month. Wounded men from the garden centre, lying in hospital beds with shattered limbs, were just as fearful. “Honestly, I don’t know what will happen,” said Vitalii, whose legs were crushed by the ceiling as it collapsed. “I’d like it to end soon but I don’t know how.” In the bed opposite Oleksandr said Ukraine could not do a deal with Russia. He had fallen badly as he escaped the fire from a second-floor window. “I think we must beat them. They came here with bad intentions.” The queues signing up for the army and territorial defence at the start of the war are long gone. Many in that first wave of volunteers are dead or too broken by their wounds to fight. Ukraine is trying harder to recruit, and conscript, younger men. Most of their front-line fighters are middle aged and exhausted. Ukraine’s generals do not squander lives in the way that Russia does. But they still suffer considerable numbers of dead and wounded, on a scale that at which President Zelensky has only hinted. European allies of Ukraine are trying, with varying degrees of success, to offer more support. The new American package of military aid will make a difference once it arrives. It means Ukraine can keep fighting. It will not win the war, and it will be the last before the US presidential election in November. If Donald Trump wins, no-one knows if he will push as hard as Joe Biden to help Ukraine. Ukraine is also helping itself, pioneering new forms of drone warfare. Maritime drones, uncrewed boats packed with explosives, have sunk Russian warships and reopened export routes through the Black Sea. Momentum in long wars shifts back and forth. Now Russia is pushing hard, as it senses it has a window of opportunity before Ukraine gets its new weapons. One big question this dangerous summer is whether Russia’s size, weight and tenacity can inflict a battlefield defeat on Ukraine that will change the strategic equation in this war. Ukraine and its allies believe that Russia does not have the combat power to do more than take limited territory at a high cost in men and materiel. But think back a year, to the time when hopes were high – too high – for Ukraine’s summer offensive. Russia is stronger now, and without a qualitative change in Ukraine’s favour, Moscow will do all it can to grind its way deeper into this war. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Gallery aims to challenge conversation about masterpiece","By Jenny Coleman",2024-05-21,"An exhibition aimed at ""challenging the conversation"" around a 17th Century masterpiece has opened in Liverpool. Diego Velazquez’s The Rokeby Venus has been loaned to the city's Walker Art Gallery as part of the National Gallery in London's 200th anniversary celebrations. A representative for the Liverpool venue said the work had ""long been a topic of public conversation and interest"" and the new display would ""challenge traditional views"" by setting it alongside ""unexpected artworks"". They said the National Treasures: Velazquez in Liverpool exhibition would ""consider new ways of seeing, focusing on the perspectives of women and queer people through a range of works that have rarely been displayed before"". The work by the Spanish old master has had several names, including The Toilet of Venus and The Mirror's Venus, but has become more commonly known by its nickname, which stems from its time hanging on the walls of Rokeby Park, a country house in County Durham. The work has been the subject of protests twice in the past 100 years - by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914 and by Just Stop Oil campaigners in 2023. The Walker's representative said it was Velazquez's only surviving female nude and was now considered an example of the objectification of women in art. Curators Melissa Gustin and Kate O’Donoghue said challenging the conversation around the ""iconic"" painting had given them ""a chance to spotlight the work of women and non-binary artists in our collection"". ""Velazquez acknowledges the woman’s gaze in this painting with Venus herself looking in the mirror,"" they said. The gallery said the exhibition around the masterpiece included The Spanish Gesture (1934) by Ethel Walker, a Scottish artist who has been ""celebrated as one of the earliest lesbian artists to openly express their sexuality in their paintings"" and Puck (1855-1859) by Harriet Goodhue Hosmer, an American sculptor ""who actively rejected the norms and social conventions expected of women"". They said a selection of photographs by South African artist Zanele Muholi, named Miss Lesbian VII (Amsterdam) and Miss Lesbian I (Amsterdam) (2009), and Rene Matić's examination of ""race, beauty, and gender"" Chiddy Doing Rene's Hair (2019) were also being displayed. The curators said the unveiling also marked the return of the masterpiece to the city after almost a century. “The Rokeby Venus first came to Liverpool in 1906 before being unveiled at the National Gallery in London, so it’s incredibly exciting to have her back in the city,"" they said. ""We are delighted to work in partnership with the National Gallery during their anniversary year and are grateful to them for this fantastic loan."" The National Treasures: Velazquez in Liverpool runs until 26 August. Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

"'Extreme' protest groups face ban under proposal","By Harry Farley",2024-05-12,"Protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations, under a proposal from the government’s adviser on political violence. An upcoming report from Lord Walney, which BBC News has seen extracts of, will recommend a new category for proscribing ""extreme protest groups"". It defines these as those which routinely use criminal tactics to try to achieve their aims. The sanctions could restrict a group's ability to fundraise and its right to assembly in the UK. The Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations. ""Militant groups like Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil are using criminal tactics to create mayhem and hold the public and workers to ransom without fear of consequence,"" Lord Walney said. ""Banning terror groups has made it harder for their activists to plan crimes - that approach should be extended to extreme protest groups too."" Just Stop Oil said the government were the “dangerous radicals that are endangering all of us” through their climate policies. Palestine Action claimed its actions were in line with most of the British public who want an arms embargo between the UK and Israel, and the proposals would not deter their campaign. The new restriction orders ""would be distinct from proscription on terrorism grounds"", the report will say. But the mechanism could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate. If a group’s actions were persistent, and used to promote a political or ideological cause, that would count against them, according to the recommendation. It will come as part of a review into tackling political violence by Lord Walney - the former Labour MP John Woodcock - which was commissioned three years ago, but is yet to be published. A government source said ministers shared Lord Walney’s objectives and would consider implementing his recommendations once the review was published. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Extremism of any kind has no place in our society and we will not tolerate tactics that set out to intimidate, threaten or cause disruption to the law-abiding majority. ""In recent months, we have also witnessed a small number of protesters display violent and hateful behaviour, and the police have our full support in tackling extremism and hate crime. “We are considering the report's recommendations extremely carefully and will respond in due course.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Water parasite outbreak to last 'at least' a week","By Chloe Parkman",2024-05-16,"An outbreak of a diarrhoea-type illness is expected to last for ""at least"" a week in south Devon, with people told to boil their tap water until further notice. Public Health said 22 cases of cryptosporidiosis had been confirmed in Brixham and up to 100 people had reported symptoms to their GP in the last week. A Brixham primary school has closed as it said running a school without drinking water was ""not possible"". Parent Nicky Langdon-Ward branded the situation as ""unacceptable"" and said South West Water (SWW) took ""far too long"" to act. Infections from the parasite cryptosporidium can be caused by drinking contaminated water or swallowing it in swimming pools or streams. SWW said the Hillhead reservoir and the wider Alston area were being investigated as a potential cause for the outbreak - an area which about 40,000 residents get their water supply from. In a statement to parents, Eden Park Primary & Nursery School said it ""has not received any bottled water or assurances of when water will be delivered"". It said: ""As you will understand, running a school without drinking water is not possible. ""We remain hopeful about opening again on Friday pending deliveries and the situation."" James Simpson, head teacher at Churston Ferrers Grammar School, said water fountains had been turned off in the school to stop infections from spreading. ""We’re asking and encouraging families to send all students to school with enough safe drinking water to get through the school day,"" he said. “We’ve been supplied with some bottled water by South West Water, but ultimately we don’t have enough."" Mr Simpson said it was ""a really inconvenient time"" during school exams but that mitigations had been put in place to prevent a full school closure. ""Undoubtedly that’s added to the stress and the worry that a number of students feel at examination time,"" he said. Ms Langdon-Ward said: ""It's not really an acceptable situation for South West Water to leave the school in."" She said her and her family had suffered from ""severe"" stomach cramps for two weeks which had resulted in her taking time off work. The parent said: ""It has taken far too long to investigate considering the number of cases in Brixham."" Prof Paul Hunter, a specialist in microbiology and infectious disease at the University of East Anglia, said cases would continue to climb even after the source was found. He said: ""It's difficult to know how big these outbreaks turn out to be and it depends on whether the contamination event is a very short lived thing. ""The difficulty here is that cryptosporidium can take up to about 10 days before you become ill, so even if they stop the infection today we'd still see new cases occurring for at least another week to 10 days."" Laura Flowerdew, SWW's chief customer officer, said earlier tests showed there was ""no indication"" of cryptosporidium in the water when it left the treatment works. She said ""extended and enhanced"" sampling on Tuesday confirmed there was concern with the water supply. ""Following that we've immediately raised a boil notice for customers in the affected areas which are Hillhead and Alston areas,"" she said. The water company initially told affected customers they would receive £15 in compensation. The payment, which will be made automatically, has since been increased by £100, to £115, SWW confirmed. Ms Flowerdew apologised for the disruption to the water supply. “Protecting the health of our customers and providing them with a clean fresh drinking water supply is our number one priority,"" she said. ""We will continue to work around the clock to make sure that happens as soon as possible.” SWW is continuing to advise people to boil their tap water and has set up water stations for residents to collect free bottled water. A water collection point at Broadsands Car Park is open from 06:00 until 21:00 BST. Following concerns from residents, the water firm on Thursday morning opened another collection point at Freshwater Quarry car park in Brixham. It said bottled water was being delivered to vulnerable residents. Prof Hunter said SWW needed to ""find out what the source is [and] try and either bypass that or clean that and flush out the system"". ""In the meantime people should boil their drinking water and that's not just water that you drink in a glass, that includes water used for brushing your teeth,"" he said. The UK Health Security Agency said it was continuing to work with Torbay Council, SWW, NHS Devon and the Environment Agency to investigate the cause. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, which cause prolonged diarrhoea, affect between 3,000-6,000 people a year in the UK, according to health officials. There is no effective antibiotic for treating it but most people recover. It is usually waterborne – and those infected either drink water contaminated by the cryptosporidium parasite or swallow dirty water in swimming pools or streams. It can also be caught from contact with animal manure. This is usually the most common way people become unwell, with a spike coming in spring when farms hold open days. Most people recover, but some can become seriously ill such as very young children and those with particularly weak immune systems. For many, the diarrhoea can last for two weeks or more. Guy Highfield, a Brixham resident, said he was ""very ill"" last week and he was disappointed SWW had not set up more water stations. He expressed concerns for elderly and vulnerable people who may be unable to collect bottled water. Mr Highfield added he had picked up about 20 homes worth of bottled water to deliver to others. ""We're only here because we've seen it on social media,"" he said. ""Even the leaflet drop person last night didn't tell us we could come and collect it. ""Get a delivery drop out to some of the elderly and vulnerable people in those areas."" SWW said it was continuing to deliver bottled water to vulnerable residents every 24 hours. Sally Everton, director of Visit Devon, said it ""was a bit of a concern"" for the future of tourism in the area. ""The national media coverage that we've had could have a knock on effect to our forward bookings but also it'll have a knock-on effect to our instantaneous bookings. ""People will probably look at Devon rather than just Brixham and Paignton and think, 'no we'll steer clear for the time being' and that is a major concern to me."" Jess Blake and her family visited Brixham for a short holiday last week. She said since returning home to Portsmouth, she had suffered from severe diarrhoea, dizzy spells, flu like symptoms and bodily aches. ""I feel sorry for the businesses now because they're going to have lots of complaints and obviously it's not their fault. ""This is the worst kind of bug that I've had, it's awful.""

"Mixed reviews for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga film","By Helen Bushby",2024-05-16,"Reviews for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, which has premiered at Cannes Film Festival, have been mixed, with comments varying from “soul-pricklingly primal” to “all spectacle and no vision”. The fifth film in the Mad Max series is a prequel, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, telling the origin story of Imperator Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron in 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road. The dystopian action films, created by George Miller, are set in the barren Australian outback, exploring the breakdown of society after an apocalypse. The Independent called the film “motional, witty and filled with purposeful savagery”, while Variety said it was “ambitious” but “no Fury Road”. David Rooney also wrote, in Hollywood Reporter, the film was “a big step down from Mad Max: Fury Road” with “little tension or fluidity in a narrative whose shapelessness is heightened by its pretentious chapter structure”. But Geoffrey Macnab wrote, in the Independent, it “has the concentrated intensity of 2015’s Fury Road, to which it is a prequel, and yet it unfolds across a far broader canvas. ""Dialogue is kept to a minimum,"" he wrote. ""But even in an action role almost entirely bereft of quieter moments, Taylor-Joy is still able to convey plenty about Furiosa’s raw inner emotions.” The film, which also stars Tom Burke and Alyla Browne, is set about 20 years before Fury Road, and we see Furiosa go from early childhood to becoming a warrior. Premiering out of competition at Cannes, it received a six-minute standing ovation - and Miller said it had, like Fury Road, ended up becoming ""almost a feminist piece"" by chance. A story featuring a male hero freeing enslaved wives from a harem would have been ""a different story than a female warrior"", he said. ""It wasn't, 'Oh, 'let's make a feminist action film,' it was always driven by story."" Screen Daily’s Nikki Baughan called the “high-octane revenge thriller” a “blistering return” but added: “While Fury Road took place over just three days, lending it a non-stop kinetic energy, Furiosa spans 15 years, divided into several chapters, which results in slower and sometimes uneven pacing.” The Daily Telegraph’s Robbie Collin called the film “cinema at its most soul-pricklingly primal”. “It's the sort of film that makes you feel like the past century of Hollywood might have been a detour and the machine has now been hauled back on course,” he added. But in Time, Stephanie Zacharek called it “all spectacle and no vision”. “Despite its many, many action sequences, and a symphonic cacophony of motorbikes vrooming in the sand, the movie, divided into chapters with droney titles like Lessons from the Wasteland, evolves into a slog that’s working hard to persuade us we’re having a good time, though it may not be actually giving us one,"" she said. Empire magazine’s John Nugent gave the film five stars and praised the lead actors, saying: “Taylor-Joy, in particular, is phenomenal, her big, intense eyes standing out starkly against her engine-oil-smeared forehead, emoting subtly in a dialogue-light role. “Chris Hemsworth’s Dementus, meanwhile, is a talker - a charismatic, frequently shirtless and increasingly chaotic despot ruling his armada of bikers… from a petrol-powered Roman chariot.” The Daily Mail’s Brian Viner also gave the film five stars, saying: “It is an absolute blast from start to finish, a worthy prequel to that high-octane 2015 blockbuster Mad Max: Fury Road. ""It is utterly stunning on the eye, decidedly loud on the ear, and a 1,000-watt jolt to the spirits - I loved it.” In the Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars, calling Taylor-Joy “tremendous” and saying she “sells this sequel”. But Kevin Maher, in the Times, wrote: “After a thrilling opening chase scene, Furiosa is rapidly sunk by a slow-moving plot and weak performances.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Conservative claim that Labour would cost families £2,000 fact-checked","By Anthony Reuben",2024-06-07,"In their first head-to-head televised debate of the election campaign, Rishi Sunak repeatedly claimed Keir Starmer would bring in ""£2,000 in higher taxes for every working family in our country"". The Conservatives came up with this figure by adding up how much they claim Labour's spending commitments would cost over four years (£38.5bn), and dividing this by the number of UK households with at least one person working. The figure risks misleading people, not least because it is really totting up more than £500 a year extra over four years, which is not what you would normally think of if somebody said your taxes were going up by £2,000. The statistics regulator said two days after the debate that they had warned against this practice and that ""someone hearing the claim would have no way of knowing that this is an estimate summed together over four years"". The prime minister defended the figure, saying that ""independent Treasury officials have costed Labour's policies"", but a letter from the top civil servant at the Treasury said that it ""should not be presented as having been produced by the Civil Service"". Labour disputes the figure and, like the Conservatives, has promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT during the next Parliament. Many of the items the Tories added up involve relatively small amounts of money. So we've looked at the five biggest - and some are accurate, but others are less reliable. The biggest Labour spending commitment identified by the Tories is the Green Prosperity Plan, which they have costed at £19bn over four years - about a third of total spending in the dossier. That figure comes from Labour, not the civil service. In February, Labour said its policies would involve a £23.7bn investment over the next parliament (five years) – which does equate to £19bn over four years. The dossier mentions other much higher figures, but eventually settles on this one. Under Labour's green plan, it is pledging fully clean electricity by 2030, with the aim of cutting the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions and reducing energy bills. Its policies include setting up Great British Energy – a publicly-owned company to invest in low carbon sources like offshore wind and nuclear – and a Warm Homes Plan to improve home insulation. The next biggest commitment is insourcing, which the Conservatives say will cost £6.5bn over four years. The idea of insourcing is to stop public services being provided by private companies and give them back to the state to carry out. There is no question that Labour are enthusiastic about insourcing, but they have not given details of where and how quickly it would happen, so a lot of assumptions are needed to come up with this costing. One is that outsourced services are 7.5% more efficient than insourced ones, based on a report from the Institute for Government. But what the report actually says is that while some outsourcing has led to greater efficiency, other attempts have resulted in ""significant overspend, while a string of failures has damaged public trust"". The 7.5% figure is only mentioned once in the report, as the lower end of the savings from outsourcing cleaning services. The dossier actually warns about the use of the 7.5% figure: ""We have low confidence in this because the difference between the cost of outsourcing and in-house delivery is highly circumstance specific."" The Conservatives are keen to stress that the dossier's cost calculations have been done by civil servants, but their work was based on assumptions made by special advisers, who are temporary civil servants and are appointed by Conservatives. They are not expected to be impartial in the way that regular civil servants are. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said in late 2023 that he wanted to double the number of CT and MRI scanners in the NHS. This is likely to end up in the manifesto because it was mentioned as part of Labour's five missions, although no deadline has been given for buying them. The policy has been costed by the Tories at £6bn over four years. There are uncertainties in the costing, in particular that it has set out the costs of the policy but not of any benefit from it in terms of greater efficiency in the NHS from having the latest equipment and of early diagnosis in terms of saving money on treatment. On the other hand, they have not included the cost of hiring and training new staff to operate the scanners, so the costing could have been higher. The provision of free breakfast clubs at primary schools is one of the things that Labour says would be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. This is also part of one of Labour's five missions. But the details of the policy are not yet entirely clear. We do not know whether the clubs would include free childcare as well as breakfast and the overall cost would depend on the take-up. The £4.5bn that the Conservatives have scored it at assumes that both food and staffing would be paid for and that half of all pupils would take advantage of the service. Number five on the list is having two million more NHS appointments per year, which is costed at just under £4bn. This measure was one of Labour's ""first steps for change"". It is a pledge for Labour's first five years in office, although they have not said how long it would take them to provide the extra 40,000 appointments a week, so charging the full cost in the early years of the Parliament may not be accurate. The dossier assumes the appointments would be more expensive than existing ones because they would be at evenings and weekends, which is in line with Labour policy. The dossier also looks at how much will be raised by some of the tax measures that Labour has announced, which involves considerable uncertainty. On the value of charging VAT on private school fees, for example, it is assumed that 11% of pupils will be moved to state schools as a result of the policy. Similarly, the amount raised from extending the windfall tax on energy companies depends on what happens to oil and gas prices. We asked independent think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies what they thought of the dossier and they told us they were waiting for the actual manifestos to be published before commenting on the totality of costs. We have also looked at Labour claims of a £71bn black hole in Conservative plans.   What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Magna Carta protest: Women in their 80s charged",NA,2024-05-11,"Two women in their 80s have been charged with criminal damage after the glass around the Magna Carta was targeted at the British Library. The Metropolitan Police said two protesters hit the protective enclosure around the historic document with a hammer and chisel on Friday. The Rev Sue Parfitt, 82, from Bristol, and Judith Bruce, 85, from Swansea, have been bailed. They are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 20 June. A statement from the British Library said its security team ""intervened to prevent further damage to the case, which was minimal"" and ""the Magna Carta itself remains undamaged"". The library, which is on Euston Road between Euston and King's Cross stations, added that the gallery housing the display was closed until further notice. Campaign group Just Stop Oil said a sign reading ""the Government is breaking the law"" was held up during the incident, before the women glued themselves to the display.

"Boil water warning after parasite found","By Chloe Parkman, Georgina Barnes & Heidi Davey",2024-05-15,"People across south Devon have been advised to boil their tap water as 22 cases of a diarrhoea-type illness have been confirmed. A further 70 suspected cases are also being investigated. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the parasite, cryptosporidium, was ""predominantly a waterborne disease"". Infections can be caused by drinking contaminated water or swallowing it in swimming pools or streams. South West Water (SWW) said the Hillhead reservoir and the wider Alston area was being investigated as a potential cause for the outbreak. Dr Lincoln Sargeant, director of Public Health in Torbay, said about 40,000 people get their tap water from the reservoir. “In terms of people who have actually been affected we have to date 22 confirmed cases and about 70 to 100 people have contacted their GP with similar symptoms over the last few days.” SWW has urged residents across Brixham, Boohay, Kingswear, Roseland and north-east Paignton to boil their tap water. Chris Rockey, from SWW, said people should boil water to drink, cook and clean their teeth within the affected areas. He said the firm would continue to work with ""health professionals and monitor the water"" and that it had started its investigation after it was contacted by the UKHSA on Monday. The company said data from tests on Tuesday showed treated water leaving its treatment works was not contaminated, but further tests overnight found small traces of cryptosporidium. SWW said it was confident boiled water was safe and had issued the advice as a precaution. Mr Rockey said he was unable to provide a timeframe for how long residents should continue to boil water. He said further advice would be issued when the water supply had ""returned to normal"". Laura Flowerdew, SWW chief customer officer, said it was a mistake for the company to tell people to keep using the water on Tuesday. She said: ""With the benefit of hindsight and additional sampling we've taken we do realise that now perhaps we should have said something different yesterday. ""However we operated at that point with the best intentions and using the sampling and the water quality monitoring that we had available to us, and we were working with the public health authorities as well."" Ms Flowerdew said SWW was ""working as fast as we can to make sure we are supporting customers"" and that it would set up two additional water stations. ""We have people working throughout the night to try and understand and find the root cause of the problem - as soon as we've done that we will give further information to customers."" ​Conservative MP for Totnes and South Devon, Anthony Mangnall, said: “It is enormously frustrating that South West Water weren’t quicker to respond at the first point at when this was reported. “It started with an initial denial that it was anything to do with their network and of course they have now found the cryptosporidium is in their network and they are responding. “Residents were quick to actually point out there was something wrong with the water, they could taste it, and now they are suffering.” Mr Mangnall said: “What I want to see is for them to address the problem, fix it as quickly as possible and make sure the support for residents is there both now and into the future so they can have confidence in their drinking water.” Mr Rockey said the increased number of people who were unwell in the Brixham area had led to the water company undertaking additional monitoring. SWW said ""small traces of the organism"" were identified overnight and on Wednesday morning in the Hillhead section of its network. It said: ""We apologise for the inconvenience caused and will continue to keep customers and businesses updated."" The firm said unboiled water could continue to be used for washing, bathing and toilet flushing. The parasite, also known as crypto, causes an illness or disease called cryptosporidiosis affecting people and some animals, the UKHSA says. It can be found in the intestines and faeces of infected humans and animals and can contaminate lakes, rivers, swimming pools, untreated or poorly treated water and food. Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach pains, nausea or vomiting, low-grade fever and loss of appetite which can last up to two weeks. The bug is most common in children aged between one and five and also those with weak immune systems. The UKHSA says most people with healthy immune systems will recover within one month. Harriet Oakley, from Alston, Brixham, said she contacted SWW on Tuesday for “clarity on the situation” as she was worried for her seven-month-old daughter and four-year-old son’s health. She said: “They said to me categorically the water is safe, you should continue to use it as normal – we’re less than 24 hours later [and] we have been notified that the water is not safe to drink. “I’ve been making up bottles for a small child, you go to any of the supermarkets and you can’t get bottled water anymore because the shelves are sold out.” Ms Oakley said she was “outraged” by the change in advice. She said: “I think they need to have a good long look at themselves – they’re meant to be providing a safe service. “We don’t have the luxury of being able to pick and choose water services, they’re the only option that we have, we have to use them. “They are messing with people’s lives, their incomes… most of all they’re impacting people’s health, which is unacceptable.” Prof Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, said: “It’s difficult to know how big these outbreaks turn out to be. “It depends on whether the contamination event was a short-lived thing or whether it was over quite some time. “Even if they stop the infection today, we will still see new cases occurring for up to a week to 10 days.” Prof Hunter said: “They’ve got to find out what the source is and how it got into the drinking the water. ""It’s a difficult problem coping with boil water notices, but that’s effectively all you can do.” Anne Kelly-Groucutt, who runs Hortus House, in Brixham, said she believed her business had been affected by the incident. She said two cancellations were made on Tuesday following cryptosporidium reports. She said one booking was cancelled after just a matter of minutes. ""It's a little concerning,"" she said. ""In the history of us having the B&B we have never had a cancellation within 10 minutes of a booking."" Jane Boyle, resident at Hillhead, Brixham, said she received a letter through her door on Wednesday from the water company telling people to boil their water before use. She said people had been sick in her area for about 10 to 13 days and they thought it was food poisoning. Ms Boyle added it was ""distrusting"" of SWW to take so long to provide information. Hillhead resident Helen Sneyd said: ""It's not very nice for anyone to have gone through that - let's just hope they clear it up quickly"". The UK Health Security Agency said it was working with Torbay Council, SWW, NHS Devon and the Environment Agency to investigate the cases.

"Water firm 'fallen short' on parasite outbreak","By Georgina Barnes",2024-05-17,"The boss of South West Water (SWW) says she is ""truly sorry"" for the outbreak of a diarrhoea-type illness in south Devon. A total of 22 cases of cryptosporidiosis were confirmed in the Brixham area by UKHSA on Wednesday, with more than 100 people reporting symptoms to their GP in the last week. SWW said it believed it had located the source where the parasite could have entered the water network. About 16,000 homes and businesses have been served boil water notices, with SWW CEO Susan Davy saying the company had ""fallen significantly short"". She said: ""Our ground technicians have been working around the clock to identify the source of the contamination and rectify the situation so we can resume a normal water supply. ""To those in the affected area and our customers across the South West, I am truly sorry for the disruption and wider anxiety this has caused. ""While incidents like these are thankfully very rare, our customers expect a safe, clean, and reliable source of drinking water."" Infections from the parasite cryptosporidium can be caused by drinking contaminated water or swallowing it in swimming pools or streams. Outbreaks cause prolonged diarrhoea and affect between 3,000-6,000 people a year in the UK, according to health officials. Cases of cryptosporidium will be seen in Brixham for at least the next 10 days, a professor has said. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said the parasite could be in the incubation period for up to two weeks. He said: ""Even if they have stopped all new infections by now, you would expect to see further cases for at least 10 days to two weeks.” SWW looks after water and wastewater services for 1.8 million customers across Cornwall, Devon, the Isles of Scilly and parts of Dorset and Somerset, according to its website. The water company said investigations were continuing, as were tests of the water quality. It also asked customers to continue boiling their water before consuming it. Ms Davy said she knew SWW had ""fallen significantly short"" of what customers expected. She said: ""All of us at South West Water live and work in the region, just like you. ""It is our home and a place we love. I am sorry this has happened."" SWW said affected customers would be given £115 in compensation and that the amount would be kept under review. On the government's website, the Drinking Water Inspectorate confirmed SWW was investigating and continued to work with relevant health authorities. Water Minister Robbie Moore assured residents boiled water was safe. ""We need South West Water to resolve this issue and ensure clean water returns to the Brixham area as soon as possible,"" he said. Schools have been affected by the situation. A Brixham primary closed to students on Thursday as it said running a school without drinking water was ""not possible"". South Devon College, which is in the affected area, said it was open and all the necessary precautions were being taken. Principal Laurence Frewin said its priority was reducing disruption to students taking exams. ""We don't want them coming in feeling worried about something that's happening around them so we've taken every step that we can to make them feel settled, to make them feel assured, ready for their exams and happy with what they're doing."" A campsite has lost bookings due to the contaminated water. Aaron Richardson, receptionist at Wall Park Touring Caravan campsite, said customers have contacted the park stating it was ""too risky"" to visit. Mr Richardson said the park was left without fresh water until Thursday night. He said SWW has not communicated with the campsite to keep them informed on the water developments. ""There is no contact from SWW to inform us about it properly,"" he said. Michael Smith co-owner of Venus café at Broadsands beach said the current compensation offer of £115 would not come close to matching their losses. He said: “It will be thousands of times that. During the week at the minute we are not super busy, but we are losing £400 or £500 per day for the last couple of days. ""And come the weekend, with sunshine next and half-term the week after we are talking many thousands”. Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

"Parasite outbreak cases in Devon double to 46","By Georgina Barnes",2024-05-17,"The number of confirmed cases of a waterborne disease in south Devon has more than doubled, health officials say. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said cases of cryptosporidiosis, an illness that causes prolonged diarrhoea, had risen to 46. More than 100 people have also reported symptoms, it said. It comes after South West Water (SWW) chief executive Susan Davy said she was ""truly sorry"" and admitted the company had ""fallen significantly short"". About 16,000 homes and businesses have been advised to boil water before drinking it until further notice. SWW said it was draining the Hillhead reservoir and the wider Alston area of Brixham was still being investigated as a potential cause for the outbreak. Infections from the parasite can be caused by drinking contaminated water or swallowing it in swimming pools or streams. The company previously said a faulty valve might have allowed a parasite to make its way into the water network. Kayley Lewis said her 13-year-old son had been admitted to hospital after blood was found in his vomit. She said her family had started becoming sick on 5 May - 10 days before the water firm advised residents in Brixham to start boiling their water after traces of cryptosporidium were found in part of its network. Ms Lewis said the past fortnight had been ""scary"". ""It was really worrying because blood and sick for a child gives red alerts,"" she said. ""Every time he would take a sip of water it would come straight back up. ""He is going OK now but he is still getting headaches now and then."" Ms Lewis said she had lost about 6lb (3kg) since she first started showing symptoms. She said: ""I was poorly for six days straight... My other son was crying on the floor in pain - he is autistic so he didn't know what was going on. ""It's very, very painful, it's not just when you have a bug, it is constant."" Ms Lewis said SWW's response to the issue had been ""disgusting"". In a statement, Ms Davy said: ""To those in the affected area and our customers across the South West, I am truly sorry for the disruption and wider anxiety this has caused. ""While incidents like these are thankfully very rare, our customers expect a safe, clean, and reliable source of drinking water."" Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said there would be ""very, very hard questions"" for the water company to answer. ""More answers"" would be obtained for the public, Ms Atkins said. ""At the moment we probably need to give them space to conduct their investigation - the public will want to know how on earth a source happened, what was the chain of events that led to this?"" she said. ""The message of reassurance is that this sort of outbreak really is rare for drinking water."" Anthony Mangnall, Conservative MP for Totnes and South Devon, said heads were ""going to have to roll"" over the cryptosporidiosis outbreak. He said although he was unable to ""give the sentence before I give the verdict"" it was important to find out what had happened for it to go wrong. ""From the handling thus far to the delays in communication with the community to the denial at the beginning makes me deeply concerned about the management at South West Water,"" Mr Mangnall said. ""That to me is pretty indicative that at some point heads are going to have to roll over this."" Stephen Cole-Mansfield, a guesthouse owner in Brixham, said the parasite outbreak had ""killed business overnight"". ""We are empty - it has been devastating, we are starting to ramp up for the season and we have no business,"" he said. “It has been badly portrayed, and it has affected the hospitality business across Brixham. ""It is in a small part of Brixham which doesn’t even affect us."" Mr Cole-Mansfield said he had not received any information regarding compensation. “This is a direct result of their under-investment, lack of testing and the fact we have a severely antiquated sewage system in the area which needs updating,"" he said. ""It needs sorting out."" SWW said affected customers would be given £115 in compensation and the amount available would be kept under review. Sally Dart, who runs homewares shop Flotsam 50 near Brixham Harbour, said business was ""probably 30 to 40% down"" and the situation was ""appalling"". ""No-one was checking the quality of the water and we’ve all got sick and it’s stupid, really,"" she added. Duncan Kenny, co-owner of non-profit conservation shop The Cove, said he had received no communication from SWW apart from one leaflet. ""If any business, of any kind, at any time, is affected by a causation that could have been prevented, that causation is responsible,"" he said. Michael Smith, co-owner of the Venus Cafe near Brixham, said he had seen a 40% drop in business in the last two days and had not been contacted by SWW ""in any fashion"". ""During the week, at the minute we’re not super busy, but we’re losing four, five hundred pounds per day the last couple of days,"" he said. ""Come the weekend, sunshine next week and the week after, we’re talking many thousands."" Dr Lincoln Sargeant, Torbay's Director of Public Health, said he expected ""upwards of 100"" additional cases in the coming days. ""We may continue to see people having symptoms despite the fact that we have identified what we think is the most credible cause and that we have taken the appropriate public health actions to stop further contamination,"" he said. ""The next key objective is to make sure it does not then spread person to person - that's why we are still stressing the importance of hand hygiene, of excluding from school and work... and also not to swim if you've had recent diarrhoea."" Dr Bayad Nozad, a consultant in health protection at the UKHSA, asked people not to contact medical services unless they needed ""urgent clinical care"". ""If your symptoms last longer than seven days, or if you experience more severe symptoms such as blood in your poo, please contact your doctor who may recommend taking a sample for testing,"" he said. ""Those with symptoms should stay off nursery, school and work for 48 hours since the last episode. ""Anyone with diarrhoea should not go swimming for 14 days after the last episode of illness.""

"'Boil in a bag' and five other Bafta TV moments","By Noor Nanji",2024-05-12,"There were tears, there were surprises, there were a fair few parasols - as the Bafta TV awards took place on the hottest day of the year so far. The ceremony is now over and we know all the winners and losers. The final seasons of Happy Valley and Top Boy scooped up multiple awards on the night, while there were also special prizes for Baroness Floella Benjamin and daytime TV star Lorraine Kelly. Here are six other highlights from this year's ceremony. Many of the celebrities wore loose fitting outfits, as they tried to keep cool with the sun beating down on London's Royal Festival Hall. Not so Joe Lycett. The comedian arrived dressed as Queen Elizabeth I, in a white cape and gown with a ruff around his neck. Lycett did carry two different types of fan on the red carpet, one manual and one battery-powered, as temperatures soared. But that wasn't enough to keep him cool. ""It's boil in a bag,"" he said of his silver ensemble. He also liberally applied sun cream, not only to himself but also to the TV critic Scott Bryan on the red carpet. ""It was very surreal but to be honest, I'm not sunburnt now so I'm very happy,"" Bryan later remarked. Lycett later won best entertainment performance for his Channel 4 show Late Night Lycett. The comedian came on stage and promptly declared: ""I lost a bet, I'm so hot and I need a piss."" He added: ""Thanks to my mum and dad, Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII."" There were rumours that the five remaining Friends would reunite at the Emmy Awards earlier this year to pay tribute to their late co-star Matthew Perry. That never materialised. There was also criticism after Perry was omitted from the memorial section of the Bafta Film Awards in February - although that was probably deliberate, as he was primarily known for his work in television. But on Sunday night, the actor - who died aged 54 last year - was remembered during the ceremony. Some of his most memorable scenes from Friends were played on the screen to the audience. The In Memoriam segment also included tributes to talk show host Sir Michael Parkinson, Strictly Come Dancing professional Robin Windsor, journalist Emily Morgan, newsreader George Alagiah and Hairy Biker Dave Myers. It was a busy night for comedians Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan, who not only presented the awards ceremony but also scooped a win of their own for their show Rob and Romesh VS. They opened by issuing instructions to the gathered celebrities about any acceptance speeches. ""Producers, you can come up to the stage if you must, but please stand at the back and let the famous people talk,"" Ranganathan said. ""To the actors, it's impossible to 'fall in love with a script' - you read it, you liked it and thought it would make you some money."" The duo also took aim at former prime minister Liz Truss, NHS waiting times and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the night. But while some viewers enjoyed the jokes, others were less than impressed, calling them ""total cringe"" and ""awkward"". ""The silences after each joke are excruciating,"" wrote one social media user. Ouch. A number of stars used the red carpet as an opportunity to make political statements. Brian Cox, who starred as Logan Roy in Succession, wore a red pin with a hand on it, a symbol that is seen as calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The Scottish actor lost out in the best actor category to Timothy Spall, who won for his role in The Sixth Commandment. But he did take to the stage during the evening to present a special award to Lorraine Kelly to mark her 40 years on TV. Steve Coogan, who was nominated for his portrayal of serial sex offender Jimmy Savile in BBC drama The Reckoning, also wore the red pin. He also lost out to Spall. But speaking earlier on the red carpet, he told the PA news agency that his Bafta nomination felt like a ""vindication"" of his decision to take on the risky role. Khalid Abdalla, who starred as Princess Diana's late boyfriend Dodi Fayed in The Crown, also wore the red pin. Arriving for photos on the red carpet, the 43-year-old actor held up his hand on which he had written, ""Stop arming Israel"". In his other hand, he carried 14,000 red sequins, which represented children who have been killed in Gaza, he said on X (formerly known as Twitter). Actress Hannah Waddingham, 49, won hearts after the way she reacted to losing on the night. Hannah Waddingham: Home For Christmas was in the running for the best entertainment award, but lost out to Strictly Come Dancing. After the camera panned to her following the announcement, Waddingham was seen smiling before lifting a bracelet - which was also a small flask - and taking a sip. She then raised it again, signalling ""cheers"". On X, fans were delighted, with one calling her an ""icon"" for drinking out of her bracelet. ""Hannah Waddingham's reaction to losing to Strictly was just amazing,"" one said. The star emerged victorious later in the night, when the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 won the award for best live event coverage. Waddingham, who co-hosted the event last year in Liverpool, joined others who had been involved in the song contest on stage to accept the award. So this last one might feel like a sore point, after the UK came 18th in last night's Eurovision Song Contest 2024. But speaking to the BBC after Eurovision 2023 won the Bafta for best live event coverage, commentator Scott Mills and executive producer Andrew Cartmell were optimistic about the country's future prospects. They didn't want to dwell on the null audience points, with Mills saying Alexander was a ""world class performer"" and has ""nothing to be embarrassed about"". After having won a Bafta, they remain optimistic that the UK will place top at Eurovision one day. They said it ""going to happen"" and that we will get there one day.

"Top Boy and Happy Valley triumph at TV Baftas","By Steven McIntosh",2024-05-12,"The final seasons of Top Boy and Happy Valley were among the big winners at the Bafta TV Awards on Sunday. Top Boy, which first aired on Channel 4 but was revived by Netflix, won the prestigious best drama award. It held off competition from Happy Valley, but the BBC drama won best actress for Sarah Lancashire as well as the memorable moment prize. There were also special awards for daytime TV star Lorraine Kelly and Baroness Floella Benjamin. Happy Valley star Lancashire thanked the BBC ""for giving this very British drama a very British home"". She said winning the award was ""an honour"" and thanked the show's ""formidable cast and crew"". The actress paid tribute to creator and writer Sally Wainwright. ""I shall forever be grateful to you for this opportunity,"" she said. Happy Valley also won most memorable moment, the only prize voted for by the public. The scene which won was the dramatic conclusion of the series which saw Sergeant Catherine Cawood have a final showdown with Tommy Lee Royce in her kitchen. ""Thanks to Sally Wainwright for writing that memorable scene where my dad blows himself up in front of my grandma,"" joked actor Rhys Connah. Top Boy, a series about the lives of two drug dealers on a Hackney estate, won the prestigious best drama trophy. The show's producer Charles Steel paid tribute to the drama's stars Ashley Walters and Kane Robinson, who ""created these incredible characters and brought them to life"". Jasmine Jobson was named best supporting actress for her performance in the show. The actress told the audience she was ""overwhelmed"" to win the prize, and concluded with a tribute to her niece. Jobson said: ""My baby girl, Auntie Jasmine did it - I did it! The girl finally brought it home."" Speaking backstage, Jobson added: ""I was just a normal girl from west London that was just trying to do better for myself and was just wishing and hoping for the best."" ""And one day I went from working in a bar full time and acting part time to suddenly acting full time, and now acting pays my bills. So Top Boy changed my life."" Jobson held off competition from The Crown's Elizabeth Debicki and Lesley Manville. It was a bad night overall for Netflix's royal series, which went home empty handed. Timothy Spall was named best actor for his performance in The Sixth Commandment, about the deaths of Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore-Martin. ""This is a story about many things, about terrible crimes, but it's also about love,"" Spall said of the series, which also won best limited drama. ""We're privileged, particularly when you're telling real stories about real lives, that people give you permission to do this. We're just storytellers really."" Spall said he had not prepared an acceptance speech because he did not expect to win. He joked viewers should instead ""look it all up on IMDB, and you'll see who was involved"" in making the series. Elsewhere, the In Memoriam section was accompanied by an instrumental version of Friends theme tune I'll Be There For You, and included a tribute to actor Matthew Perry. It also featured talk show host Sir Michael Parkinson, Strictly professional Robin Windsor, newsreader George Alagiah and Dad's Army star Ian Lavender. Baroness Benjamin won the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, an award which was introduced by a video message from the Prince of Wales. He paid tribute to her ""groundbreaking work with children and young people; her longstanding commitment to television broadcasting; and for her work as an unwavering champion of inclusion"". In her acceptance speech, Baroness Benjamin said: ""I feel blessed, looking back at my adventurous journey, sparkled with affection but also challenges and adversities."" ""I've been told 'shut up, or you'll never work again' when I spoke out. But my mission over the last 50 years has been to get broadcasters to have diversity and inclusion in their DNA. ""And I am so proud of my work for children, making them feel loved, confident, hopeful and worthy, as I took them through the windows of imagination."" She added: ""It's important that we provide high quality, regulated content, which reflects children's lives, no matter where or how they're watching."" Best scripted comedy went to Such Brave Girls, a BBC Three series which follows a single mother and her two daughters and how they cope after their husband and father leaves. Creator and star Kat Sadler said: ""Writing is really hard and this is really nice, so thank you."" Other winners included Strictly Come Dancing, which was named best entertainment programme. Host Tess Daly said it had been ""the most wonderful series"", adding: ""We may be tapping up a few of you in the room for the next series."" ""Thank you Bafta for making it worth putting on Spanx on the hottest day of the year,"" she joked. Joe Lycett, won best entertainment performance, holding off competition from Graham Norton and Ant and Dec. Lycett paid tribute to the people of Birmingham and jokingly paid tribute to his parents, ""Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII."" Referring to his extravagant outfit, he joked: ""I lost a bet.. hence this."" Mawaan Rizwan won best performance in a comedy for BBC Three's Juice. In his acceptance speech, Rizwan joked: ""Thank you to my therapist - we had a conversation last week where we said I had to stop relying on external forms of validation. Bad timing!"" There was a similarly humorous speech from Gbemisola Ikumelo, who won best female performance in a comedy for Black Ops. She joked her agent would be telling her next employers: ""Yesterday's price is not today's price!"" Collecting the award, she referred to recent efforts to diversify the Bafta Awards and the TV industry, commenting: ""This is how you know diversity is working!"" Last year's Eurovision Song Contest won best live event coverage, the day after this year's contest was held in Sweden. Hannah Waddingham, who hosted the 2023 event, said: ""The week we had this time last year was, for everybody here, the most exceptional, stressful week, but so fabulous."" Matthew Macfadyen won best supporting actor for Succession, but was not at the ceremony in person to collect the award. Read more about the winning shows: Swimmer Ellie Simmonds won best documentary for her programme Finding My Secret Family. ""I wouldn't be here without my mum and dad adopting me and my four other siblings,"" she said. ""I love you, and my birth mum as well, for meeting me at the end and having all those answers."" Elsewhere, one of the night's biggest surprises was Class Act winning best international TV show, beating heavy hitters including Beef, The Bear and Succession. Actor Brian Cox presented Kelly's prize, paying tribute to her four decades in television. Kelly said: ""I've got to thank everybody that I've worked with over the past 40 years, and I'm really proud to work on breakfast and daytime telly, because we're campaigning, we're groundbreaking, but we also have an awful lot of fun."" ""I'm so honoured our viewers think of me as a friend, that's incredible."" She referred to her ""working class Glasgow background"" adding that she ""wants everyone to have those opportunities"" in the TV industry. Director Andy Mundy, whose programme White Nanny, Black Child won the specialist factual award, became emotional during his acceptance speech. ""This has been a tough, tough place to break into, I come from a council estate in Brixton,"" he said. ""I've dreamed for many years about being on this stage. ""I just want to say to people who come from the same background as me, keep on dreaming, keep on working, keep on getting into good trouble."" Channel 4 News's Inside Gaza: Israel And Hamas At War won the news coverage award. Journalist Matt Frei dedicated the award to all the journalists who had been killed covering wars this year.

"Warning over rat poison after East Yorkshire family of foxes killed",NA,2024-05-08,"A wildlife charity is calling on people to be more careful with pest control after a family of foxes died after apparently eating rat poison. The Wildlife Alliance Hull and East Yorkshire was contacted by a Hull woman when she found a vixen and her three cubs sick in her garden. Jennifer Quinn from the charity said people should use different methods to deal with rodents. She described the animals' deaths as ""awful"". ""It causes manic running, so manic movements the fox can't keep still running around in circles,"" she said. ""You get a lot of vomiting vocalisation, so they scream, they literally scream. ""It's gut wrenching."" Ms Quinn said the mother was found dead at the scene and her three cubs were too ill to save, despite being taken to a vet for treatment. She said the charity had also dealt with owls and other animals that had been poisoned, including cats and dogs. Ms Quinn added that people needed to use alternative methods to deal with pests. ""There are loads of different ways of keeping rats out of your garden,"" she said. ""Something as silly as the fact that rats as a species are neophobic, which basically means they don't like change. ""So just changing a few things around in your garden puts them off coming in."" She also suggested planting daffodils and hyacinths and using peppermint oil as a deterrent. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

"Defector MP and 'Strictly Come Darting'","By BBC News",2024-05-12,"Senior Conservatives tell the Observer that Natalie Elphicke defected to Labour because she was never made a minister. An unnamed cabinet source claims the former Conservative MP had become bitter about being passed over for a senior role, first by former Prime Minister Liz Truss, then Rishi Sunak. There is no response from Ms Elphicke but the paper comments that the Conservative Party is looking for ways to undermine the MP for Dover. Describing Ms Elphicke as a ""turncoat MP"", the Mail on Sunday says allegations that she asked former justice secretary Robert Buckland to pull strings for her ex-husband could prove embarrassing for her new party leader, Sir Keir Starmer. As the paper points out, he is a former director of public prosecutions. The Sunday Telegraph has more details on the reported crackdown on Civil Service positions devoted solely to diversity. Senior managers will be ordered not to hire staff dedicated to boosting diversity, equality and inclusion. Staff already there whose jobs are focussed only on diversity will be moved to Human Resources teams and given broader job specs, it reports. Cabinet Office Minister Esther McVey tells the paper she is concerned Whitehall managers are becoming distracted by what she calls ""woke hobby horses"" rather than delivering their core function. The Telegraph also reports that Russia is recruiting far-right extremists to carry out attacks in the UK and other Nato countries. Intelligence sources have told it that undercover agents of the GRU - the Russian military intelligence service - and members of the Russian mercenary group Wagner have got people to carry out a number of attacks in western Europe and the US over the past six months. It is thought the Kremlin is copying Iran's lead and encouraging criminal gangs to carry out proxy terrorist attacks, the paper reports. The Sun on Sunday welcomes proposals which could see extreme protest groups banned. In an editorial, the paper says that although the plans will ""provoke howls"" of outrage from civil liberties groups, they are not an attack on freedom but a defence of it. Unnamed friends of the King tell the Sunday Times that he agreed to a request from the Duke of Sussex to let him stay in a royal residence during last week's trip to London, because he no longer has an official UK home. In the end, he is thought to have chosen to stay in a hotel. The King and his youngest son did not meet during Prince Harry's visit. Friends of the King say that if Harry had stayed in a royal residence, it would have made a meeting logistically easier. Finally, the Sunday Telegraph reports that dog walkers who allow their animals to attack livestock could have their pets seized by police. New laws being drawn up by the government will give officers ""beefed up"" powers to detain dogs they believe have attacked or worried livestock. The paper says farmers believe the problem has been made worse by ""lockdown puppies"" - dogs bought during the pandemic, which are less socialised than normal because of Covid restrictions when they were young.

"Just Stop Oil doctor suspended for five months","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-23,"A doctor, arrested and jailed for her involvement in Just Stop Oil protests, has had her medical licence suspended for five months. Dr Sarah Benn, formerly a GP in Birmingham, was arrested after taking part in peaceful demonstrations at the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire. Dr Benn, who had already given up practising in August 2022, said that as a doctor, she had a moral duty to take action to protect life and health. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) imposed the suspension on Tuesday after ruling last week that Dr Benn's fitness to practise was impaired. The doctors' trade union, the British Medical Association (BMA), said it was ""very concerned"" that a doctor's participation in environmental protests amounted to professional misconduct. Dr Benn said: ""How could my patients trust me again, if I didn’t take action to confront the greatest health crisis we face?"" The General Medical Council (GMC), which referred the case, said the hearing was convened due to the fact her actions at the terminal broke the law, damaging public trust. Faye Rolfe, counsel for the GMC, said Dr Benn's conduct had brought the profession into disrepute. The tribunal said in its findings: ""The public must be able to trust that doctors will always act within the law."" The hearing related to three peaceful Just Stop Oil protests outside Kingsbury terminal in 2022, despite an injunction against them. A high court judge jailed Dr Benn for eight days on remand for protests on 26 April and 4 May, after she failed to answer her bail on 4 May and instead attended the demonstration. On 14 September, Dr Benn was arrested along with 51 others after obstructing a private access road, preventing vehicle access in and out of the terminal. She was sentenced to 32 days in prison. Dr Benn told the tribunal that traffic generally passed normally during the protests, and that if the road was closed for any duration, it was for police convenience rather than a necessity. Dr Benn had previously taken part in climate change protests in September and October 2019, but the GMC closed that case and advised her to ""reflect on her actions"". Dr Emma Runswick, BMA deputy chair of council, had said there was ""no possible public or patient interest"" for a tribunal where potential sanctions included the removal of a doctor's licence in these circumstances. Dr Runswick said: ""Climate change has been declared the biggest potential health crisis in the world by the World Health Organisation (WHO)."" A spokesperson for the Doctors' Association UK said: ""This is a story of a clinician being punished for raising serious concerns about dangerous inaction on the greatest threat to global health we have ever, or will ever experience. ""The right to peaceful protest is a basic human right. It cannot and must not be taken away. ""Given the evidence on climate change and its health impacts, we strongly believe that peaceful protest should not be viewed as condemnable professional misconduct – but as commendable public health advocacy.""

"Ruling against Just Stop Oil doctor alarms BMA","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-22,"The British Medical Association (BMA) has said it is ""very concerned"" by a tribunal's finding that a doctor who was arrested after peacefully participating in Just Stop Oil protests had committed professional misconduct. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service ruled Dr Sarah Benn's fitness to practise was impaired and said it must consider whether a sanction should be imposed on her registration. The General Medical Council (GMC), which referred the case, said the hearing was convened due to the fact her actions at Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire broke the law and resulted in her imprisonment. But Dr Emma Runswick, BMA deputy chair of council, said there was ""no possible public or patient interest"" in such circumstances for proceedings where potential sanctions included the removal of a doctor's licence. Addressing the tribunal's findings, Dr Runswick said the BMA was concerned Dr Benn’s registration as a doctor could be threatened for taking part in peaceful protests relating to the climate change emergency. She said: ""Climate change has been declared the biggest potential health crisis in the world by the World Health Organisation (WHO). ""The reality is that cases such as this risk adding to the sense of fear doctors hold about the GMC and the medical practitioner tribunals. ""We hope that simple common sense will prevail in this case, as maintaining the high standards and good reputation of the medical profession will not be progressed by taking action against those taking part in peaceful climate change action."" The tribunal related in total to three protests Just Stop Oil conducted outside the terminal on 26 April 2022, 4 May 2022, and 14 September 2022. An injunction had previously been granted against people participating in climate change protests in the locality. A high court judge sentenced Dr Benn to eight days on remand in custody for the events of 26 April and 4 May 2022, after she failed to answer her bail on 4 May and instead attended a protest at the terminal. On 14 September, Dr Benn was arrested along with 51 others after obstructing a private access road, preventing vehicle access in and out of the terminal. For that, she received a 32-day prison sentence. Dr Benn told the hearing the British Medical Journal had called on governments to act urgently on climate, especially those in wealthier countries such as the UK. Dr Runswick said the BMA would be formally responding to current GMC rules on procedure, stating: ""[This] offers a unique opportunity to consider automatic referrals to tribunals in such cases and specifically whether the rules are appropriate where the context is peaceful protest.""

"Two more arrests over MP's office protest","By Pamela Bilalova",2024-04-29,"Two more people have been arrested after an MP's office was targeted in a demonstration against a new coal mine. Mark Jenkinson's constituency base in Maryport was covered in posters reading ""Stop Tory Coal"" at about 08:10 BST on Friday. Protest group Just Stop Oil said opening a new mine in Cumbria was ""total madness"", but Mr Jenkinson dubbed the protesters ""spoilt, middle-class climate clowns"". Cumbria Police confirmed a total of four women had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. All have been released on bail while investigations continue. Permission for a mine near Whitehaven was granted in December 2022, making it the first new coal mine to be approved in 30 years. At the time, critics argued it would undermine climate change targets, while supporters welcomed promised jobs. Mr Jenkinson, who is the Conservative MP for Workington, hit out at the protesters, calling them ""plonkers"" in a social media post. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, he described them as ""entitled morons who think they are above the law"". He added: “Unfortunately, the film on the glass has been scratched and some of the paintwork damaged."" In a statement, Just Stop Oil questioned whether Mr Jenkinson's tirade in response to their actions was the ""standard of adolescent response"" constituents deserved.

"Just Stop Oil doctor's fitness to practise 'impaired'","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-19,"A tribunal has found a doctor's fitness to practise to be impaired due to misconduct after she was involved in a number of Just Stop Oil protests. Dr Sarah Benn, a GP in Birmingham until 2022, was arrested after taking part in demonstrations at the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire. The General Medical Council (GMC) said the proceedings were not brought as a reaction to her participation in protests, but the fact that her actions broke the law and resulted in her imprisonment. The tribunal said it must now consider what sanction, if any, to impose on the doctor’s registration. Dr Benn said as a doctor, she had a moral duty to take action to protect life and health and that the climate emergency was a health emergency which was ""happening now"". At the tribunal, the 57-year-old referred to the British Medical Journal and stated they were calling on governments and leaders to act urgently on climate change, especially those in wealthier countries such as the UK. She also submitted that there was evidence that non-violent direct action helped to change policy and law, and that this had been proven by history, citing the example of the Suffragette movement. She added: ""How could my patients trust me again, if I didn’t take action to confront the greatest health crisis we face?"" Ms Rolfe, acting as counsel on behalf of the GMC, said that Dr Benn's conduct had brought the profession into disrepute because she had broken the law by failing to comply with the injunction against protests at the Kingsbury oil terminal on multiple occasions. She added that Dr Benn's fitness to practise was impaired as her conduct failed to justify patients' trust in the profession. Ms Rolfe submitted that it was not the taking part in protests the GMC had issue with, but the risk to the public's trust in and respect for doctors by seeing a doctor flouting the law and openly stating her intention to keep breaking the law. She added that while Dr Benn had stated there may be members of the public who, both now and in the future, will agree with what she had done, there will also be groups of society, ""that do not agree, do not understand, and can never understand"". The tribunal said in its findings: ""The public must be able to trust that doctors will always act within the law."" The hearing related to three peaceful protests Just Stop Oil conducted outside the Kingsbury oil terminal on 26 April 2022, 4 May 2022, and 14 September 2022.

As a result of this, she received a sentence of 32 days imprisonment.  Dr Benn spent the majority of her career as a GP in inner city Birmingham and as a GP trainer and undergraduate tutor. During the pandemic, she worked remotely for NHS 111, the Worcestershire COVID Management Service, and on-site at her practice. She continued to work as a GP at Hollyoaks Medical Centre in Birmingham until 2022, ceasing clinical work in April 2022 and relinquishing her licence to practise in August 2022.

"Just Stop Oil: Protesters guilty aggravated trespass at Les Misérables show","By Jess Warren & PA Media",2024-04-19,"Five Just Stop Oil protesters have been found guilty of aggravated trespass after they stormed a performance of Les Misérables in London's West End. Two of the activists were also found guilty of criminal damage after standing on the theatre's orchestra pit netting. The show at Sondheim Theatre was halted at 21:00 GMT on 5 October 2023, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. The estimated cost to the theatre of cancelling the performance was £60,000. The protesters entered the stage during a performance of Do You Hear The People Sing? and locked themselves to the set. The ""angry"" audience of around 1,000 people was asked to leave the auditorium and the performance was brought to a halt around an hour later after police removed the activists. Having denied the charge, Hannah Taylor, 23, Lydia Gribbin, 28, Hanan Ameur, 22, Noah Crane, 18, and Poppy Bliss, 19, were found guilty of aggravated trespass following a trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Gribbin and Crane were additionally found guilty of causing £2,000 worth of criminal damage to the theatre's orchestra pit netting which is designed to protect the musicians below from objects falling off the stage. The court was told the netting had suffered ""structural damage"" from the weight of the two protesters standing on it. The cost of repairing the damage and refunding the audience was covered by the theatre's insurance, the court heard. Asked how the audience had reacted to the group disrupting the performance, theatre manager Daniel Lewis told the court: ""I heard frustration, I heard anger, I heard swearing."" Giving evidence, Gribbin said she did not want the orchestra pit to be damaged by the protest and believed it would be safe to stand on the netting. Les Miserables company manager Matt Byham said he was ""angry"" the protest had happened when a child actor was on stage. All five protesters will be sentenced at a later date.

"Union pleads for government help to save biofuel jobs",NA,2024-04-30,"A union has called on the Scottish government to prevent a biodiesel plant closing with the loss of 75 ""green jobs"" in North Lanarkshire. Argent Energy is mothballing its facility in Newarthill, near Motherwell, on 31 May. Unite had demanded action from the Scottish government including grants from its  just transition fund. The Scottish government said it was ""always stand ready to discuss difficulties being faced by businesses, and to explore possible solutions with them"". The company supplies biodiesel to Stagecoach England, Metroline buses in London, and Eddie Stobart. It also supplies biofuels to oil and gas companies, including Shell and BP, to blend with conventional diesel. Its plants in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and Amsterdam will remain open. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the union was exploring every option to keep the plant open. “Argent Energy workers based at Newarthill are exactly the type of workforce supposed to be spearheading the march to greener jobs,"" she said. ""The Scottish government needs to step in now or else its green jobs strategy will be in ruins.” The union said Scotland's £500m just transition fund and low emission scheme grants could be used to keep the plant open. Argent Energy is consulting staff on the closure in one-to-one interviews. On Tuesday a spokesman for the company confirmed that it was in the consultation period until 24 May. The spokesman said: ""The proposal, subject to the consultation, is for Argent to stop the plant and for redundancies to be effective from 31 May."" The company previously confirmed it would be expanding its operations in Holland  amid severe economic pressures on biodiesel production. A statement from the company said there had been ""unprecedented competition"" from imported subsidised Chinese biodiesel and cited the UK’s inability to import category one tallow - the company’s main feedstock - from the EU due to regulations. Esther O’Hara, Unite industrial officer, said closure would be a ""devastating blow"" to the workers, and Scotland’s just transition ambitions. ""There is £500m set aside for green jobs and there are also low emission scheme grants worth tens of millions which this plant should be able to access,” she said. “It would be a cruel irony that one of the reasons given by the company for the plant’s closure is down to other governments subsidising biodiesel imports into the UK, yet our own governments in Edinburgh and London seem incapable of lifting one finger to support these jobs.” The Newarthill plant has the capacity to produce up to 50 million litres of biodiesel a year. The company was founded in 2001 and began production in Lanarkshire four years later. The Scottish government said: “It was disappointing to learn of Argent Energy’s situation, which we understand has been influenced in part by challenging post-Brexit trading conditions. “First and foremost, this is a concerning time for the company’s staff and their families, and supporting affected staff members must be the immediate priority. ""The Scottish government’s PACE team provided on-site support last week and continues to engage with the business."" The statement added: ""While we have no formal role or power in trade remedy investigations or decisions highlighted by Argent Energy, we are aware of and supportive of industry’s engagement with the Trade Remedies Authority over these issues and urge the UK government to consider measures to avoid damage to the domestic biofuel sector.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

"MP hits out at 'spoilt middle-class climate clowns'","By Pamela Bilalova",2024-04-26,"An MP has hit out at what he called ""spoilt, middle-class climate clowns"" after his office was targeted by Just Stop Oil protesters. Mark Jenkinson's constituency office on Senhouse Street in Maryport was targeted by protesters at about 08:10 BST on Friday, who covered the windows in posters reading ""Stop Tory Coal"". Two women have been arrested following the protest, which was against plans for a new coal mine in West Cumbria. Just Stop Oil branded Mr Jenkinson's comments ""adolescent"". Mr Jenkinson, the Conservative MP for Workington, called the protesters ""plonkers"" in a social media post criticising their actions. Speaking to the BBC, he described the protesters as ""entitled morons who think they are above the law"".  He said the window cleaner, who had just left, had to return to clean-up ""after these overgrown attention-seeking babies"". “Unfortunately, the film on the glass has been scratched and some of the paintwork damaged by the childish antics of these spoilt, middle-class climate clowns,"" he added. He further criticised the protesters who he said had driven to the area in cars that run on fossil fuels, used plastic tape and paper made from the felling of trees, as well as leaving items behind for others to clean-up.  Cumbria Police said it was investigating reports a window had been damaged by an adhesive. A woman in her 40s and another in her 60s have been both arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Mr Jenkinson added: ""I have it on good authority that the ringleader is spending some carbon neutral time in the cells. “They deliberately picked a sitting Friday because they thought I wouldn’t be here – but as it happens I was, and I gave them a few choice Anglo-Saxon words before they scuttled back to their hiding places as most people head to work.” In response Just Stop Oil said opening a new coal mine in Cumbria was ""total madness"". Permission for the mine near Whitehaven was given in December 2022, making it the first new coal mine to be approved in 30 years. Supporters welcomed promised jobs but critics argued at the time it would undermine climate change targets. Just Stop Oil questioned whether Mr Jenkinson's tirade in response to their actions was the ""standard of adolescent response"" constituents deserved. A spokesman said: ""Opening a new coal mine as our climate spins out of control is total madness. ""The British steel industry does not want this mine for coking coal. ""It’s time ordinary people held “plonkers” like Mark Jenkinson to account, because at the moment politics is failing us."" In response to the MP's claims about driving cars and using other polluting materials, the group said: ""For the record, he hasn’t a clue how our people got there.""

"GP could be struck off after Just Stop Oil protest","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-18,"A doctor could be struck off the medical register after taking part in a Just Stop Oil demonstration. Dr Sarah Benn, a GP from Birmingham, was arrested after taking part in a demonstration at the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire in 2022. Dr Benn held a sign saying ""no new oil"" and was subsequently found to be in breach of a civil injunction and was imprisoned for 31 days, Just Stop Oil said. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) started the hearing to decide if the 57-year-old can maintain her licence to practise medicine on Monday, with the tribunal expected to last until 24 April. Just Stop Oil described the demonstration in Kingsbury as a ""peaceful demonstration demanding the government to bring an end to new fossil fuel projects"". On its listing of the hearing, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service says: ""The tribunal will inquire into the allegation that on 26 April 2022, 4 May 2022 and 14 September 2022, Dr Benn engaged in peaceful protests within a prohibited buffer zone at Kingsbury Oil Terminal in breach of an interim injunction granted on 14 April 2022. ""It is alleged that Dr Benn’s actions amounted to contempt of court and resulted in a custodial sentence."" According to Just Stop Oil, Dr Benn informed the General Medical Council and her employer after each arrest and she argues that her actions are consistent with medical ethics, which prioritise patient and public safety above all. The environmental activist group said three GPs are under scrutiny for similar reasons this year, with Dr Benn’s case being the first heard. Speaking before the hearing, Dr Benn said: ""As a doctor, my fundamental duty is to protect health and life. This includes proactive efforts to prevent disease and death. ""The climate crisis is the most significant existential threat to global health we have ever faced. “This is why I felt compelled to address what I see as the most critical health crisis currently unfolding—one that is already causing widespread death, disease, and destruction globally and is set to worsen."" Dr Benn said she did not take the protests and disruptions she had participated in lightly and she found no joy in causing inconvenience or distress. But she said people ""must be clear about the magnitude of the crisis we face"". ""The disruptions caused by peaceful protest are nothing compared to the catastrophic impacts of continuing to burn fossil fuels,"" she said. ""I will be sad and upset if I am removed from the register, but that will have no effect on my future plans. ""I will continue carrying out what I believe is my responsibility as long as the government refuses to commit to stopping oil and gas.” Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"One million people at risk of Thames crossing fines","By Lewis Adams",2024-04-28,"About one million people could be at risk of fines for crossing the Thames between Essex and Kent, figures from National Highways show. The government company said motorists with accounts for using the Dartford Crossing had been told to revalidate their card details in July 2023. But just 770,000 of its 1.7 million account holders successfully updated their details as requested. Road users have told the BBC they received fines after their accounts were closed without them knowing. The standard one-off cost for car drivers using either the southbound QE2 bridge or the northbound Dartford Tunnel is £2.50. National Highways changed its service provider for the Dart Charge last July and a series of errors in the system followed. Sarah Day, from Colchester, told BBC Essex her account was shut without her knowledge and she received ""a whole bunch of fines"" at the start of this year. Stuart Randall added that he was issued seven fines worth £332.50 in total after the same error happened to him. Another person revealed bailiffs had been sent to their house over missed payments - transactions they thought had been automatically paid. National Highways said inactivity or invalid payment details could cause a Dart Charge account to close. It added that all customers who received a fine could submit a challenge. ""The Dartford Crossing has around 4.5 million crossings per month and the vast majority of crossings are paid without issue,"" a spokesperson said.

"Pentagon to 'rush' Patriot missiles to Ukraine in $6bn package","By Holly Honderich & Will Vernon",2024-04-27,"The Pentagon says it will ""rush"" Patriot air defence missiles and artillery ammunition to Ukraine as part of its new military aid package. However Patriot systems for launching the missiles will not be sent, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Patriots were ""urgently"" needed to face a growing Russian air threat and ""can and should save lives right now"". On Saturday, Ukraine said Russia had carried out another massive air attack. Authorities in Kharkiv said a hospital was damaged. Energy facilities in three regions were attacked, Energy Minister German Galushchenko said. Russia attacked with cruise missiles, S-300 surface-to-air missiles and Iskander ballistic missiles, Ukraine said, adding that 21 were downed using aircraft, air defence systems and jamming. Ukraine claimed to have hit two Russian oil refineries across the border. Footage from one in the Russian region of Krasnodar appeared to have caused a large explosion, though local authorities denied significant damage. Russian authorities said on Saturday they had shot down some 68 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Speaking on Friday, Mr Austin told a news conference that the US was committing to its largest security assistance package to date and would ""move immediately"" to get the supplies to Ukraine. The US was using $6bn (£4.8bn) for this purpose, he said. A source confirmed to the BBC that the $6bn was part of a $60bn aid package signed into law by US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, which also includes $1bn in more immediate aid. The assistance would include air defence munitions, counter-drone systems and artillery ammunition but not Patriot missile systems. ""It's not just Patriots that they [the Ukrainians] need, they need other types of systems and interceptors as well,"" Mr Austin said. ""I would caution us all in terms of making Patriot the silver bullet."" Mr Austin added that he was confident that more of the missile systems would be made available for Kyiv soon. Conversations were ongoing with European partners, he said, to deliver additional capabilities. The Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Brown, said the assistance should eliminate the Ukrainians' need to ration shells on the frontline. Some of the latest funding would also go to building up Ukraine's own defence industry, so that it can start manufacturing more of the ammunition it desperately needs. Mr Austin said Russia had already increased domestic production of artillery ammunition and other weapons - as well as being propped up by supplies from Iran and North Korea. ""Understand what's at stake for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the United States,"" he said. ""If Putin prevails in Ukraine - Europe would face a security threat it hasn't seen in a lifetime. Russia will not stop in Ukraine."" Asked whether the US aid would protect Ukrainian forces, Mr Austin said that the commitment was ""material, real, and substantial"" although ""not instantaneous"". ""It's going to take some time to get it in there and distribute. The Ukrainians were able to hold - with this capability, they can do a lot better."" The defence secretary's words came as Ukraine warned on Friday that Russia was ramping up attacks on its railways. A Ukrainian security source told the AFP news agency that Moscow wanted to damage Ukrainian railway infrastructure to ""paralyse deliveries and movement of military cargo"". Ukraine only has a handful of Patriots to complement other Western missile defence systems and existing stocks of Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), such as the S-300. The Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m. Germany has already promised an extra Patriot system - and its defence and foreign ministers appealed to their European counterparts earlier this month to respond urgently. Greece has stocks of Patriots and S-300s but said none could be spared. ""We explained why we cannot do it,"" Greek  Prime Minister Kyrios Mitsotakis told Skai TV. His said his country's air defences were ""critical systems for the protection of Greek air space"". According to reports, Spain will supply some Patriot missiles but not a full system. Recent months have seen Kyiv step up its calls for Western assistance as its stocks of ammunition are depleted and Russia makes steady gains. Ukrainian officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Iraqi father in legal first against BP over son's death","By Esme Stallard & Owen Pinnell",2024-04-23,"A father has started legal action against UK oil giant BP over the death of his 21-year-old son. Hussein Julood alleges the burning off of gas at a BP-run oil field in Iraq - a practice known as flaring - caused his son Ali's leukaemia. A BBC World Service investigation in 2022 found Ali's village, which lies within the field, had high levels of cancer-causing pollutants known to come from flaring. BP said ""we understand the concerns"" and are supporting change. The case is believed to be the first time an individual has started legal action against a major oil firm over its flaring practices. The claim letter - which has been seen by BBC News - alleges that Ali's leukaemia and subsequent death was caused by ""toxic emissions from the Rumaila oilfield"", and that BP is partly responsible as the lead contractor. Mr Julood is seeking compensation for the cost of his son's medical treatment - including overseas chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants - loss of earnings, funeral costs, as well as the ""moral loss"" of his son. ""I am just hoping for those who hear my voice, from BP, to consider my situation. I am not representing myself alone, I am also representing those poor people living here and suffering from pollution,"" Hussein Julood told BBC News. Wessen Jazrawi, partner at Hausfeld & Co, which is representing Mr Julood, said: ""This is an important example of environmental litigation seeking compensation for harmful emissions from a carbon major. Such companies have generally been able to carry out harmful environmental practices with impunity, particularly where these occur in the Global South."" Gas flaring is the burning of gas released in oil extraction; it is dangerous for human health as the gas can contain a mixture of harmful cancer-causing chemicals such as benzene. Rumaila oil field has the highest documented levels of flaring in the world, according to BBC analysis of World Bank figures. Hussein Julood said one of the most crucial goals of his claim was that regular flaring should be stopped in Rumaila so that more families did not suffer. Ali was just 15 when he was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and underwent two years of treatment including multiple courses of chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant and radiotherapy. His father said he was a keen footballer and enjoyed school, but after so many stays in hospital he was unable to return to classes. In 2021, he was confirmed to be in remission and was excited about the future - he opened a phone shop locally. A year later, he was found to be in relapse. His father tried desperately to raise funds to send him to India for experimental treatment. However, Ali passed away on 21 April last year before he could make the trip. Speaking to the BBC, Ali's father said: ""It was a very sad year for the family. For me, his mother, and his brothers too. Ali was an unforgettable person, he was my backbone, I depended on him in my work, my life, and in everything in the house. All the days we live are sad."" In 2021, Ali documented his life living within the boundaries of Rumaila oil field as part of a BBC Arabic investigation into flaring. The BBC also undertook the first pollution monitoring in Rumaila and other local communities. The results indicated high levels of exposure to benzene and other carcinogens - substances that can increase the risk of cancer - and suggested local people were at elevated risk of leukaemia as a result of flaring. The Iraqi government is the owner of the Rumaila oil field but BP is the lead contractor for managing the site with partners PetroChina, in a consortium called Rumaila Operating Organisation (ROO). The operating standards for ROO - which BP signed - state: ""Those who are impacted by pollution levels that exceed national limits are legally entitled to compensation."" BP's share of flaring emissions from Rumaila — based on its participating interest in the field's operating company of 47.6% — stood at 3.7m tonnes CO2e in 2021. That's more than the emissions of two million UK cars annually. Although the activity happened in Iraq, Mr Julood is able to bring the claim in the UK courts because BP's headquarters is in the UK. In response to BBC's request for comment, BP said: ""As we have stated before, BP is not and has never been the operator of the Rumaila field. Nevertheless, we continue to actively support the lead contractor - Basra Energy Company Limited (BECL) - in its work to help the operator of the field, the Rumaila Operating Organisation (ROO), to reduce its flaring and emissions."" Last year, after the BBC documentary was aired, and just a week after Ali's death, Mr Julood addressed the BP board at the company's Annual General Meeting and asked it to stop gas flaring. Bernard Looney, who was chief executive at the time, said that flaring was an issue at the site and Rumaila Operating Organisation was looking to reduce it. On the health impacts Mr Looney said: ""We continue to engage with local community representatives as you would expect....[ROO] is prioritising social welfare [and] fund support for community health initiatives."" But since then, Mr Julood says he has seen flaring and black smoke on an almost daily basis. ""It is only fake promises. There is no improvement. The environment is polluted in a way you cannot breathe,""Mr Julood told BBC News. Mr Julood also claimed there have been four or five deaths locally from cancer since Ali died, including a young boy last month. Mr Julood's lawyers said BP can enter negotiations on compensation or it can refute the claim. If BP refutes the claim the next step would be for Hussein Julood to issue a court claim and the case could then be heard before judges in the UK. Under Poisoned Skies The deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq.

"Energy secretary Claire Coutinho defends government's climate record","By Kate Whannel",2024-04-21,"Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho has defended the government's environmental record following criticism from the outgoing boss of the climate watchdog. Head of the Climate Change Committee, Chris Stark, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that Rishi Sunak had ""set us back"" on climate change. Ms Coutinho said the government had a ""very strong track record of delivery"". However, she also said it did not want to ""heap costs on families"" in its pursuit of net zero targets. The UK is committed by law to ensuring that by 2050 its emissions will be net zero - meaning the country will no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide and methane - in the atmosphere. Last year, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a major shift in the government's approach - including delaying a ban on new petrol and diesel cars and weakening targets on phasing out gas boilers. Labour in February rowed back an earlier commitment on environmental project spending buy a shadow minister told the BBC the party still has ""incredibly ambitious plans"". The Climate Change Committee provides independent advice to ministers and monitors its progress on targets. Mr Stark, who is due to stand down from the body, told the BBC the ""diplomatic impact"" of Mr Sunak's announcement had been ""immense"". ""The overall message was that the UK is less ambitious than it once was."" Asked about his comments, Ms Coutinho said the UK was the first country of all major economies to halve its emissions since 1990. She said that since coming into her role in 2023, she had made changes to the tax system to boost investment in the energy sector. However, she also argued that the government would take ""a sensible and pragmatic"" approach to achieving net zero. She said she did not want to ""heap costs on families"" particularly when ""other countries are polluting a lot more"". Broadcaster and environmental campaigner Chris Packham said he understood the government were ""giving people room to breathe"" but asked: ""What about their children, what about their grandchildren."" He said clean energy needed to be affordable for people but argued that if the Conservative government had invested more in renewables when it came to power in 2010, the UK would be in a better position now. Mr Packham also defended environmental protests after Mr Stark said campaigners were often ""their own worst enemy"". In recent years some climate change groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion have carried out disruptive protests to promote their cause. The Springwatch presenter said: ""When it comes to climate protests - sometimes we have made mistakes"" adding that the methods had occasionally prevented the message from getting across. However, he said it was important to have a ""radical flank"" and that disruptive protests by groups such as Just Stop Oil prompted people to contribute to ""less radical"" organisations. In his interview, Mr Stark also urged Labour to be more ""bold"" on climate change, saying that, compared to his shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband, the party leader Sir Keir Starmer ""doesn't talk about it quite so much"". Earlier this year, Labour announced it would be ditching its policy of spending £28bn a year on its green investment plan, but still wanted to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. Appearing on the same programme, shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood said her party had had to ""scale back"" its plans, blaming the ""likely economic inheritance"" from the Conservatives. However, she insisted that had not stopped Labour from having ""incredibly ambitious plans"" including its 2030 target. She acknowledged that, under a Labour government, there would still be a ""strategic gas reserve for when the wind and sun are not available"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Newspaper headlines: Posh Spice at 50 and calls for 'Met chief to resign'","By BBC News",2024-04-21,"The Sunday Telegraph leads on calls for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, to resign, after one of his officers accused a man of being ""openly Jewish"" during a pro-Palestinian protest. Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden is quoted acknowledging that the police ""have a hugely difficult job"" - but he suggests the Met has been ""disrespecting"" Jews. In a separate article in the Telegraph, the former Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, argues that Sir Mark must go. She claims there is ""too much fear and even more favouritism"" in the way the Met polices pro-Palestinian protests. Writing in the Sunday Times, the man who was warned he could be arrested, Gideon Falter, says Sir Mark has to go, because he's lost the control of the streets. Mr Falter states that: ""It's not just that central London is a no-go zone for Jews, but a police-enforced, Jew-free zone."" According to the Observer, Labour is launching a new campaign to win over Tory-supporting pensioners ahead of the local elections in England next month. The paper says the party has detected alarm among older people about the impact a Conservative tax-cutting pledge could have on pensions and the NHS. Senior Labour figures are said to believe that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt made a huge blunder when he said his party wanted to abolish National Insurance contributions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written an article in the Telegraph, saying that he is proud to be English and that his party will celebrate St George's day on Tuesday ""with enthusiasm"". The paper suggests the article is a bold attempt to outmanoeuvre the Conservatives on the issue of national identity. It's also described as a ""slapdown"" to those in his own party, who've criticised Labour's use of patriotic symbols in its campaigning. Writing in the Sunday Express, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride and Health Secretary Victoria Atkins defend the government's plan to tackle what they call ""the sick note culture"". They say it's unacceptable that huge numbers of people are repeatedly being signed-off work, and not given the opportunity to discuss what adjustments could be put in place to help them carry on in their job. Separately the Express says the Home Office is preparing a list of 200 asylum seekers who'll be on the first deportation flight to Rwanda. The paper says more than 24,000 people have been told they are being considered for removal. Both the Sunday People and Sunday Mirror say climate change activists from the group Just Stop Oil are plotting to cause misery for thousands of holidaymakers this summer. According to the reports, they are preparing to storm airports across the UK and Europe, and glue themselves to runways and clamber onto jets. The Mirror says an undercover reporter heard about the plans at a meeting attended by hardcore activists. And the Mail on Sunday says the King is planning to attend Royal Ascot in June, despite his cancer treatment. The paper says he's told courtiers that he wants to honour his late mother, who missed only one Ascot during her 70-year reign. The Mail says he may also attend Trooping the Colour.

"An audible sigh of relief in the Middle East","By Lyse Doucet",2024-04-20,"The latest round in the region's most dangerous rivalry appears to be over, for now. Israel still has not officially acknowledged that the attack in Iran in the early hours of Friday morning was its doing. Meanwhile, Iran's military and political leaders have downplayed, dismissed and even mocked that anything of consequence happened at all. The accounts over what kind of weaponry was deployed on Friday and how much damage was caused are still conflicting and incomplete. American officials speak of a missile strike, but Iranian officials say the attacks, in the central province of Isfahan and in northwest Tabriz, were caused by small exploding drones. ""The downed micro air vehicles caused no damage and no casualties,"" Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian insisted to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency. But these simple quadcopters are Israel's calling card – it has deployed them time and again in its years of covert operations inside Iran. This time their main target was the storied central province of Isfahan, which is celebrated for its stunning Islamic heritage. Of late, however, the province is more famous for the Natanz nuclear facility, the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre and a major air base, which was used during Iran's 14 April attack on Israel. It is also an industrial heartland housing factories which produce the drones and ballistic missiles that were fired by the hundreds in Israel's direction last Sunday. So a limited operation seems to have carried a powerful warning – that Israel has the intelligence and assets to strike at will at Iran's beating heart. It is a message so urgent that Israel made sure it was sent before, rather than after, the start of the Jewish Passover, as was widely predicted by Israel watchers. US officials have also indicated that Israel targeted sites such as Iran's air defence radar system, which protects Natanz. There is still no confirmed account of its success. So this attack may also be just an opening salvo. But it was, for the moment, an unintended 85th birthday gift to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel's official silence gave Iran's ultimate decision-maker vital political space. Tehran did not have to invoke its new rule that whenever its arch-enemy strikes, Iran will hit back hard, with the risk of sparking a perilous escalatory spiral. Iran is also basking in what it sees as its new projection of power. Hardline President Ebrahim Raisi did not even mention these most recent events in his Friday speeches. For the Islamic Republic, it is all about what it dubs Operation True Promise – its unprecedented onslaught against Israel in the dead of night last Sunday. He hailed what he called his country's ""steely will"". Iran has prided itself for years on its ""strategic patience"", its policy of playing a long game rather than retaliating immediately and directly to any provocations. Now, it is invoking ""strategic deterrence"". This new doctrine was triggered by the 1 April attack on its diplomatic compound in Damascus, which destroyed its consular annex and killed seven Revolutionary Guards, including its most senior commander in the region. Iran's supreme leader was under mounting pressure to draw a line as Israel ramped up its targets during the last six months of the grievous Gaza war. No longer just striking Tehran's assets, including arms caches, buildings, bases and supply routes on battle grounds like Syria and Lebanon, Israel was also assassinating top-ranking officials. A decades-long hostility, which had previously played out in shadow wars and covert operations, erupted in open confrontation. Whatever the specifics of this latest tit for tat, there is a more fundamental priority for both sides: deterrence – a more solid certainty that strikes on its own soil will not happen again. If they do, there is a cost to pay, and it will hurt. For the moment there is an audible sigh of relief in the region, and in capitals far and wide. Israel's latest move, under anxious urging from its allies to limit its retaliation, will have eased this tension, for now. Everyone wants to stop a catastrophic all-out war.  But no one will be in any doubt that any lull may not last. The region is still on fire. The Gaza war grinds on, causing a staggering number of Palestinian casualties. Under pressure from its staunchest allies, Israel has facilitated the delivery of greater quantities of desperately needed aid, but the blighted territory still teeters on the brink of famine. Israeli hostages have still not come home, and ceasefire talks are stalled. Israel still warns of battles to come in Hamas's last stronghold in Rafah – what aid chiefs and world leaders say would be yet another untold humanitarian disaster. Iran's network of proxies across the region, what it calls an ""Axis of Resistance"" stretching from Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon through Iran-aligned militias in Iraq and Syria, to the Houthis of Yemen, are at the ready, still attacking daily. In the last few weeks, simultaneously everything and nothing has changed in the region's darkest, most dangerous days. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"'Apocalyptic' Dubai floods shake picture-perfect city","By Sean Seddon",2024-04-18,"If Dubai is the ultimate Instagram city, then this was the week the filter came off. Over an unprecedented 48 hours, the skies over the United Arab Emirates darkened and torrential storms washed away Dubai's picture-perfect image. About 25cm (10in) of rain - roughly twice the UAE's yearly average - fell in a single day, leaving much of the city's outdoor infrastructure under water. Jordache Ruffels, a British expat living in Dubai, told BBC News experiencing the storms was like ""living through the apocalypse"". He watched from his apartment overlooking the city's usually tranquil marina as furniture was flung from balconies by gale-force winds and Rolls Royce cars were abandoned on roads suddenly transformed into rivers. ""We live high up and could barely see a thing past the balcony... It felt like midnight in the middle of the afternoon,"" he said. A cluster of four large storms, each of them towering 15km (9 miles) into the atmosphere and fuelled by a powerful jet streams, rolled into the UAE one after another, according to forecasters at BBC Weather. Heavy rainfall over the desert landscape of the Gulf is not unheard of, and residents were warned via a public alert system - but Dubai's weather infrastructure was unprepared for the worst rain since 1949. In many ways, few modern cities would have coped with the size of the deluge that hit Dubai this week. The city's top attractions - largely indoors to protect from the searing heat - struggled to handle the sudden influx of water. Caroline Seubert, 29, from the UK, was with her husband at a shopping centre when the storm hit. ""The mall was flooded, ceilings were collapsing,"" she said. ""We were told to leave, but the metro was shut and the taxis were not running. ""We were stranded, had to sleep in the mall lobby overnight."" Matt Weir, a British teacher who has been based in Dubai for 10 years, said ""people were aware"" a storm was coming but the force of it left ""neighbourhoods under water"". While the forecast looks more typically blue and sunny for the week ahead, some storms remain possible - and with roads and other infrastructure still crippled, Dubai's rulers are counting the cost. The UAE's President Sheikh Mohammed bin Nahyan issued a public order for ""authorities to quickly work on studying the condition of infrastructure throughout the UAE and to limit the damage caused"". Government employees have been told to work from home until the end of the week, while private firms have been encouraged to do the same. Schools across the country have been shuttered. So far, the official death toll in the UAE is just one person - an elderly man who died when his vehicle was swept away in Ras Al Khaimah, according to local media. Some of the worst disruption has been at Dubai International Airport, the world's second busiest, where nearly 90 million people - more than the population of Germany - are expected to pass through in 2024. It is an important hub for travel to the Gulf and connecting flights heading further afield - but witnesses say it has descended into bedlam after the floods. A flooded taxiway meant planes were unable to reach the runway to take off and passengers were left stranded in the terminal building. The country's state-owned airline Emirates was forced to stop accepting check-in passengers at all. While it has since re-opened check-in, it says many passengers ""are still waiting to get on flights"". Jo Reilly is among the travellers left in limbo. The 41-year-old was flying back to the UK from Vietnam via Dubai with her daughters Holly, 13, and Ruby, nine, when the storm struck. After two-and-a-half hours circling over the Gulf waiting for a chance to land, they eventually landed at another Dubai airport, before being told in the middle of the night to get on a bus to head for their original destination. She told BBC News her daughters ""were practically crushed in a stampede as hundreds of desperate people were fighting for a seat on the coach"". Once they eventually reached Dubai International Airport, the situation was no better. Jo said: ""We asked can we have water, can we have food? Nothing. There's nothing here. People are really, really in a bad way. ""We've been told it's Sunday night the earliest we can get home and apparently we're quite lucky to have that option. ""Emirates are saying there are no hotel rooms so I said, 'Oh, so we're just to carry on sleeping on the floor?' And they said, 'Yes, go make yourself comfortable over there' and pointed to the corner of the check-in area."" Jonathan Finchett, also from the UK, described ""apocalyptic"" scenes in the airport, where people were arriving to find their flights had been cancelled. He told BBC News he saw families ""barricading themselves behind a circle of luggage trolleys to keep themselves safe because they didn't feel that safe because there was absolutely no staff"". Queues at ticket desks were ""pure chaos"", he said, adding: ""There were hundreds of people stampeding towards this, like a crush. All of a sudden you had women screaming saying they couldn't breathe."" Emirates said it appreciated ""how difficult it is for everyone affected"" and that schedules were returning to normal. Dubai International Airport said: ""As much as possible, we've been providing necessary assistance and amenities to affected guests but due to road blockages, it's taken longer than we would have liked."" As for how things are now in the city, Jordache Ruffels said things had ""practically returned to normal"" after swift action by the authorities. ""There's a sense of unity and togetherness in times like this,"" he added. The storms hit a Dubai - home to 3.5m people - which would be unrecognisable to the 100,000 residents who called it home in the 1970s, before the oil boom. There is also an annual influx of 14m tourists, including the influencers and celebrities seeking luxury hotels and glamorous backdrops (UK reality TV stars Joey Essex and James Argent were among those caught up in the disruption). Its modern image runs alongside a strong regulatory and political control of media content where even foreign publications can be censored before distribution. Some people living in Dubai that the BBC has spoken to in recent days asked to remain anonymous out of fear of repercussions. Matthew Hedges is an academic researcher who has authored a book on the UAE. In 2018, he was detained and tortured there after being falsely accused of spying. He told BBC News he has spoken to UAE residents who are angry about the lack of preparedness for these floods, and who know extreme weather is a long-term issue facing the country. Mr Hedges continued: ""They have absolutely no way to legitimately or safely voice their concerns. If they do they will be punished and repressed."" He also said he feared for the country's poorer migrant workers - who make up a majority of the population and are likely to be hit harder by these climate events. He added: ""It is not the Emiratis who will suffer - they have jobs where they can work from home and drive 4x4s. It will be the expat workers, the labourers, who suffer."" BBC News has contacted authorities in Dubai for comment. Additional reporting by Emma Pengelly, Rozina Sini, and James Kelly Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Arm skin patch system could warn of organ rejection","By Michelle Roberts",2024-04-16,"Some people having a lung transplant on the NHS will receive a skin patch graft from their donor too as a way of spotting organ rejection sooner. Rejection could show as a rash on the donated skin patch, say experts, allowing early treatment to stop problems escalating. The trial, by University of Oxford and NHS Blood and Transplant, will enrol 152 patients in England. It follows earlier success with some other transplant patients. That includes Adam Alderson, 44, from Wensleydale, who received a donor skin graft on his abdomen in 2015 when he had eight organs replaced - including a pancreas, stomach and spleen - after treatment for a rare cancer. He says the graft has already helped guide his treatment a few times to prevent his body rejecting his many new organs. He said: ""It's a really comforting thing to have - I feel safer knowing that I have a tool available to tell if something is going wrong before it becomes too serious. It's almost like an oil warning light on your car. Plus, having that visible reminder of how lucky I am is really special."" Helen Roeper, 43, from Oxford, has a lung condition called cystic fibrosis that means she may need a lung transplant in the future. She said she welcomes the idea of having a donor skin graft at the same time. ""The idea that I could potentially be able to identify any rejection early, just by looking at a patch of skin on my arm, is extremely encouraging and helps to alleviate some fears,"" she said. The chance of rejection after a lung transplant is unfortunately quite high. Blood tests, lung samples and X-rays can offer clues, but the problem might be quite advanced by then. That is why researchers are keen to find a simple, visible early warning sign. Henk Giele, associate professor of plastic, reconstructive, transplant and hand surgery at University of Oxford, was the chief investigator of the trial. He said: ""Lungs are prone to rejection due to their exposure to outside air and high propensity to infection. ""It is often difficult to know if a reaction is caused by infection or rejection as they look the same at the early stages, but the treatments for each are completely opposite."" If a rash is seen in the skin graft on the arm, a tiny biopsy or sample will be taken to confirm if early rejection is happening, and a big dose of anti-rejection medicine can be given.

"Baba Ramdev: The yoga guru under fire over Patanjali's 'natural cures'","By Cherylann Mollan",2024-04-18,"Popular Indian yoga guru Baba Ramdev has millions of followers around the world. Now his image has taken a beating after India's top court ordered him to apologise for falsely claiming that his company's products can ""cure"" serious illnesses. So, how did the man and his story unravel? In a video on his YouTube Channel Swami Ramdev - that has over 10 million subscribers - the yoga guru lies on his back on the stage, knees curled up to his chest in 'pawanmuktasan', a yoga pose that's supposed to ease flatulence. Next to him is a stack of medicines produced by Patanjali Ayurved, which claims to sell ""herbomineral preparations"". Formed by Baba Ramdev and his close aide Acharya Balkrishna in 2006, Patanjali sells everything from toothpaste to skin care and wellness products. But the Ayurvedic medicines are among its most sought-after products. He lists out a range of health issues - from fever and typhoid to liver damage and skin problems - and chides his audience for using ""poisonous, synthetic"" medicines to treat such illnesses. He urges them to use Patanjali products instead. In another video, he explains what cancer is and claims that chemotherapy, radiation and surgery do not address the cause of the disease. He then makes the extraordinary claim that Patanjali's ""anti-cancer juice"", combined with a strict diet regimen, helps ""cure all types of cancer in seven days to two months"". His audiences break into applause. But last week, India's Supreme Court banned the ads, saying the yoga guru was spreading misinformation and misleading consumers. According to the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act 1954, it is illegal to promote drugs meant for the treatment and cure of 54 medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease and blood pressure. The judges refused to accept Baba Ramdev and Mr Balkrishna's ""unconditional apology"", saying they had ""wilfully disobeyed"" their order. ""Your apology is not worth the paper it's written on,"" the court said, adding that ""you [should] suffer consequences"". The judges also rebuked the State Licensing Authority - the watchdog for Ayurvedic drugs and other traditional medicinal practices - and the Uttarakhand government (the Himalayan state where Patanjali's headquarters is located) for not taking action against Patanjali for violating laws. ""We will rip you apart,"" they said and chided the authorities for remaining in a ""deep slumber"" and ""passing the buck"". The court ordered Patanjali and its founders to issue a public apology before the next hearing to 23 April. Experts, however, say the court's reprimand is too little, too late. They point out that Patanjali and Baba Ramdev have a long history of dismissing allopathic drugs and legitimate medical practices as ineffective, while championing the curative powers of their products. The BBC has reached out to Patanjali for a response to this allegation. In 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Patanjali had launched Coronil - a herbal tablet - which it claimed could ""treat and cure"" the coronavirus. Marketing had to be stopped after an intervention by the Indian government, which said there was no data to show it worked as a treatment. However, the company continued to insist that it worked against the virus. It's not just their drugs - Patanjali's edible goods have also been criticised for being sub-standard. In 2022, Patanjali's ""pure cow ghee"" (clarified butter) failed a food safety test, but Baba Ramdev dismissed the findings by saying that the samples had been tampered with. In 2023, the brand was sent a legal notice for allegedly using cuttlefish in a dental product marked as vegetarian. In fact, Patanjali has faced so many controversies over a decade - as a simple Google search will show you - that it's hard to keep track of all of them. The latest proceedings against the firm started in 2022 after the Indian Medical Association (IMA) went to court against a ""false"" advertisement claiming that the firm's products could cure thyroid, diabetes and even macular degeneration. Last year, the court ordered them to stop making such claims and threatened to impose a fine of 10m rupees ($119,600; £96,000) for every product. Its lawyers agreed to follow the order, but a day later Baba Ramdev doubled down on the ""curative"" powers of Ayurvedic medicines and said he was ready to ""face the death penalty"" if his claims were found to be false. He accused some doctors of being biased against traditional medicine and alleged they were spreading false propaganda about his brand. Patanjali continued airing its controversial ads - in newspapers, on radio, television and at Baba Ramdev's yoga workshops in various states. The case came back into focus in January when the Supreme Court received an anonymous letter flagging the company's refusal to follow the court's order. Experts say Patanjali products are dubious because the firm has poor manufacturing practices. But the brand has vigorously defended its products, claiming that they're clinically proven and follow ""more than 3,000 research protocols"". In 2016, a court in Haridwar asked Patanjali to pay a fine of 1m rupees for selling certain products under its label although it was made by another company. The court also directed district authorities to take action against the brand if it failed to improve the quality of its products after some essential commodities like salt, jam, oil and honey, had failed quality tests. At the time, Mr Balkrishna told Times of India newspaper that Patanjali's products were ""completely safe"", their quality was ""unquestionable"" and that the brand would react ""suitably"" to the order. But despite the serious allegations, the firm has escaped regulatory action. Experts say that's because Baba Ramdev remains a massively popular figure. His followers see him as an expert on all things natural and traditional, insulating Patanjali against any kind of criticism. The 58-year-old is also believed to have close ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. The yoga guru routinely praises Mr Modi and in the 2014 general election, he openly asked his followers to vote for the BJP. A 2017 investigation by Reuters news agency found that Baba Ramdev's business had boomed since the BJP came to power and Patanjali had been able to acquire thousands of acres of land in BJP-ruled states at discounted prices to set up factories and research centres. The BBC has reached out to the BJP and Patanjali but has not received responses yet. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Telling the ‘unknown’ stories of Wales’ railways","By Oliver Slow",2024-04-13,"For a journey that takes just over an hour, there is a lot of history on the Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil railway line. It begins at Cardiff Central Station, which got its current location after renowned engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel diverted the River Taff to create a larger, flood-free site for a station to serve the city. The line follows the river north, taking in other areas of historical significance, many linked to the industrial development of the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. These stories are the subject of a geo-located train travel guide by tourism tech firm Window Seater, explaining how the industrial revolution shaped the valleys of south Wales – as well as the ensuing global impact. Just north of Cardiff is the 18th century Radyr Weir, built to divert water to the Melingriffith tin plate works, the largest in the world at the time. Although the works closed in 1957, the guide explains how the nearby area “continues to evolve into the new industrial era”. Sites include the South West School of Non-Destructive Testing, which evaluates the properties of materials, and has clients in the oil and aerospace industries. There’s also a comprehensive guide to the history of Pontypridd, in particular of the role the railway played in helping the town go from a small hamlet at the start of the industrial revolution to a major economic hub for south Wales. For travellers exploring the line, Pontypridd is a pleasant stop for a break in the journey, with a bustling indoor market, a museum that proudly tells its story – from the miners’ strikes of the 1980s to its most famous son Tom Jones – as well as the charming Ynysangharad Park on the edge of the town. The line continues onwards to Merthyr Tydfil, which, the guide informs the traveller, was once an “industrial supernova”. Much of the industry here – water, timber, iron ore and coal – helped fuel the rise of the British Empire. The guide also documents the reverse in Merthyr's fortunes in the 20th century, particularly the closure of many of its coal mines. “There is so much history packed into one small area, and it had such a large impact globally,” said Marcus Allender, managing director of Window Seater. The guides are geo-located, meaning a notification – or “blip” – appears on a user's phone when passing a location included. After creating some trial guides on tourist train routes in Thailand, the Cardiff to Merthyr guide became Window Seater’s first in the UK through the Transport for Wales accelerator programme in 2020. “We didn’t want to just talk about the death of industry, but also new industries that are popping up,” Mr Allender added. Window Seater has since introduced other guides in England, and last August launched its second guide in Wales, on the Cambrian Line. This runs between Shrewsbury and either Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, or Pwllheli on Wales’ west coast, in Gwynedd. The Cambrian guide is “more ambitious” than the Cardiff to Merthyr one, Mr Allender said, adding: “It’s a good four or five hour journey, so it’s a lot more content.” There are 26 stories on the Cambrian Line, compared with seven on the Cardiff to Merthyr route. It also includes interviews with people living and working along the line, including teachers, tour guides and historians. The topics range from the impact rural railway closures of the 1960s had on local communities, to the history of conflict and cultural collaboration on the England-Wales border, to the prominent political role of Machynlleth, the seat of Owain Glyndwr’s Welsh Parliament in the 15th century. The Porthmadog chapter also tells the town’s story as the birthplace of Thomas Edward Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia. The Cambrian Line guide is also Window Seater’s first bilingual guide, in English and Welsh. Window Seater’s product is competing for people’s attention with the likes of Netflix, podcasts and audio books, which people often consume on train journeys, but Mr Allender said you can “listen to them anywhere”. “I think if you have a natural curiosity for the trip you’re on then you’re going to enjoy these guides,” he said. “If you went to a museum, then you’d read the descriptions of what you’re seeing – this is the same thing.” He believes the guide tells the stories of people living along the line, as well as giving a voice to people whose stories are not often heard. That connection to local people is a crucial component, said Claire Williams, partnerships development officer for the Cambrian Line. “We absolutely fell in love with the idea, because it’s about engaging with communities along the line,” she said. Ms Williams said there are many unknown stories along the line, and many of them are at risk of dying out as people living there get older. “We wanted to bring that history to life,” she said, adding that the local community has also fully embraced the idea of telling their own stories. After putting a call out for stories from along the line, Ms Williams said they were “inundated”, so much so that they now have a backlog they can use in the future. “What we wanted were those really unknown stories,” she said. A large part of what the guide is trying to achieve is to showcase local culture and language, Ms Williams said. With that in mind, the English language guide includes a number of Welsh words aimed at international visitors. “So as well as having some knowledge about Wales, we want them to be able to go away with a bit of Welsh language,” she said.

"Cloghan Point: Lack of action over oil terminal plan 'shocking'","By Finn Purdy",2024-04-07,"A campaign group has said it is ""shocking"" that the infrastructure minister has not intervened over plans to expand a Belfast Lough oil terminal. A spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said minister John O'Dowd ""gave the matter careful consideration"". The Cloghan Point terminal is located outside Whitehead in County Antrim. It is currently used to store part of the Republic of Ireland's strategic reserve of diesel and gas oil. However, it is to be developed into a facility for importing oil to be stored on the site before being distributed across Northern Ireland and further afield. A planning application was submitted to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, and in September 2023 the council's planning committee voted to approve the expansion despite hundreds of letters of objection. It has faced opposition from local residents concerned over a big increase in the site's use as well as climate change issues. In some cases, planning decisions that are deemed to have a regional impact can be ""called in"" by the Department for Infrastructure. But the DfI spokesperson said that Mr O'Dowd had considered the plans ""in line with all of his statutory obligations"". They added that he ""has now written to Mid and East Antrim Council to inform them that the application will not be referred to the department for determination"". As the minister has decided not to intervene, Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have said they will now officially issue the planning permission. Hilary McCollum from the Stop Whitehead Oil Terminal group said she ""just doesn't understand"" how an argument can be made that the expansion of Cloghan Point will not have a regional impact. ""We all know we are in a climate crisis, we know we need to reduce fossil fuel use. And yet we are going to have another new oil terminal that's able to bring in oil from bigger tankers. ""That suggests to me an increase in oil imports into Northern Ireland. ""If you are increasing the amount of fossil fuels being brought in, how is that going to impact on Northern Ireland's strategy to reach net zero by 2050?"" Ms McCollum said that ""sometimes things go wrong"". ""If there's an oil spill at Cloghan Point, or if there's, worst case, an explosion at Cloghan Point, that is not just going to affect the Mid and East Antrim area, that would affect the whole of Belfast Lough, it would affect north Down,"" she said. The terminal was constructed more than 40 years ago and originally used to facilitate distribution of heavy fuel oil to Kilroot Power Station and Ballylumford Power Station in Islandmagee.

"Cabinet minister calls for whole-life murderer Victor Farrant to stay in jail","By Callum May",2024-04-10,"Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has urged Justice Secretary Alex Chalk not to release a murderer who was given a whole-life prison term. Victor Farrant was told he would never be freed after killing his ex-girlfriend Glenda Hoskins, 43, in Portsmouth, in 1996. Mrs Hoskins' children were told he may be released on compassionate grounds. Probation and prison staff and police will meet today to discuss the level of risk he poses. Farrant murdered Mrs Hoskins, an accountant, by holding her under water in her bath. Mrs Hoskins' body was found by her then 15-year-old daughter Katie at their home on the quayside in Portsmouth in February 1996. The judge at Winchester Crown Court told Farrant: ""This murder was so terrible, and you are so dangerous, that in your case the sentence of life should mean just that."" Farrant raped a woman and seriously assaulted another before killing Mrs Hoskins. In February this year, Mrs Hoskins' family was contacted by probation officials, who said Farrant was being considered for release - which can be ordered by Mr Chalk as Justice Secretary - on health grounds. They were asked if they wanted an exclusion zone and an order not to contact the Hoskins family to be added to the terms of Farrant's licence. Ms Mordaunt, the MP for Portsmouth North, is supporting Mrs Hoskins' children's campaign for Farrant to stay behind bars. She said in a letter to Mr Chalk: ""Mr Farrant should never be released. He is a danger to women and has demonstrated repeatedly, that he cannot be reformed. ""I find it deeply troubling that a man such as Mr Farrant is being considered for release on compassionate grounds when it is evident, he displayed no compassion towards his victims."" A multi-agency public protection (MAPPA) meeting will be held today at which police and probation officials will discuss the risk posed by Farrant. Mrs Hoskins' son Iain has written to the panel saying: ""The words 'compassionate release' make my blood boil. ""Our mother was murdered and subjected to months of terror and stalking by this vile creature - where's her compassion?"" The Ministry of Justice (MoJ's) early release policy states that inmates can be let out when seriously incapacitated or in the last few months of their life. It says the early release of a prisoner must not put the public at risk. The Hoskins family say they have been given no information about Farrant's health condition. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: ""Glenda Hoskins' murder was a horrific crime and our thoughts remain with her family and friends. ""Prisoners are only released on compassionate grounds in exceptional circumstances following strict risk assessments and no formal application has yet been made in this case."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Pompeii: Breathtaking new paintings found at ancient city","By Jonathan Amos, Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis",2024-04-11,"Stunning artworks have been uncovered in a new excavation at Pompeii, the ancient Roman city buried in an eruption from Mount Vesuvius in AD79. Archaeologists say the frescos are among the finest to be found in the ruins of the ancient site. Mythical Greek figures such as Helen of Troy are depicted on the high black walls of a large banqueting hall. The room's near-complete mosaic floor incorporates more than a million individual white tiles. A third of the lost city has still to be cleared of volcanic debris. The current dig, the biggest in a generation, is underlining Pompeii's position as the world's premier window on the people and culture of the Roman empire. Park director Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel presented the ""black room"" exclusively to the BBC on Thursday. It was likely the walls' stark colour was chosen to hide the smoke deposits from lamps used during entertaining after sunset. ""In the shimmering light, the paintings would have almost come to life,"" he said. Two set-piece frescos dominate. In one, the god Apollo is seen trying to seduce the priestess Cassandra. Her rejection of him, according to legend, resulted in her prophecies being ignored. The tragic consequence is told in the second painting, in which Prince Paris meets the beautiful Helen - a union Cassandra knows will doom them all in the resulting Trojan War. The black room is the latest treasure to emerge from the excavation, which started 12 months ago - an investigation that will feature in a documentary series from the BBC and Lion TV to be broadcast later in April. A wide residential and commercial block, known as ""Region 9"", is being cleared of several metres of overlying pumice and ash thrown out by Vesuvius almost 2,000 years ago. Staff are having to move quickly to protect new finds, removing what they can to a storeroom. For the frescos that must stay in position, a plaster glue is injected to their rear to prevent them coming away from the walls. Masonry is being shored up with scaffolding and temporary roofing is going over the top. Chief restorer Dr Roberta Prisco spent Tuesday this week trying to stop an arch from collapsing. ""The responsibility is enormous; look at me,"" she said, as if to suggest the stress was taking a visible toll on her. ""We have a passion and a deep love for what we're doing, because what we're uncovering and protecting is for the joy also of the generations that come after us."" Region 9 has thrown up a detective story for archaeologists. Excavations in the late 19th Century uncovered a laundry in one corner. The latest work has now revealed a wholesale bakery next door, as well as the grand residence with its black room. The team is confident the three areas can be connected, physically via the plumbing and by particular passageways, but also in terms of their ownership. The identity of this individual is hinted at in numerous inscriptions with the initials ""ARV"". The letters appear on walls and even on the bakery's millstones. ""We know who ARV is: he's Aulus Rustius Verus,"" explained park archaeologist Dr Sophie Hay. ""We know him from other political propaganda in Pompeii. He's a politician. He's super-rich. We think he may be the one who owns the posh house behind the bakery and the laundry."" What's clear, however, is that all the properties were undergoing renovation at the time of the eruption. Escaping workers left roof tiles neatly stacked; their pots of lime mortar are still filled, waiting to be used; their trowels and pickaxes remain, although the wooden handles have long since rotted away. Dr Lia Trapani catalogues everything from the dig. She reaches for one of the thousand or more boxes of artefacts in her storeroom and pulls out a squat, turquoise cone. ""It's the lead weight from a plumb line."" Just like today's builders, the Roman workers would have used it to align vertical surfaces. She holds the cone between her fingers: ""If you look closely you can see a little piece of Roman string is still attached."" Dr Alessandro Russo has been the other co-lead archaeologist on the dig. He wants to show us a ceiling fresco recovered from one room. Smashed during the eruption, its recovered pieces have been laid out, jigsaw-style, on a large table. He's sprayed the chunks of plaster with a mist of water, which makes the detail and vivid colours jump out. You can see landscapes with Egyptian characters; foods and flowers; and some imposing theatrical masks. ""This is my favourite discovery in this excavation because it is complex and rare. It is high-quality for a high-status individual,"" he explained. But if the grand property's ceiling fresco can be described as exquisite, some of what's being learned about the bakery speaks to an altogether more brutal aspect of Roman life - slavery. It's obvious the people who worked in the business were kept locked away in appalling conditions, living side by side with the donkeys that turned the millstones. It seems there was one window and it had iron bars to prevent escape. It's in the bakery also that the only skeletons from the dig have been discovered. Two adults and a child were crushed by falling stones. The suggestion is they may have been slaves who were trapped and could not flee the eruption. But it's guesswork. ""When we excavate, we wonder what we're looking at,"" explained co-lead archaeologist Dr Gennaro Iovino. ""Much like a theatre stage, you have the scenery, the backdrop, and the culprit, which is Mount Vesuvius. The archaeologist has to be good at filling in the gaps - telling the story of the missing cast, the families and children, the people who are not there anymore.""

"Offshore Energies UK report: Oil and gas fight for survival","By Douglas Fraser",2024-03-26,"If only everything could be reduced to a three-word slogan: ""Take Back Control"" or ""Yes We Can"". The ""Just Stop Oil"" campaign group tells us it's a question of justice and it's simple - ""just"" like that. The fossil fuels industry is struggling to find a simple response. With equal and opposite simplification, it could be ""You'll Need Us"". But the argument set out in the annual business report of Offshore Energies UK is much more complex than that. And in the battle for the survival of the oil and gas industry in British waters, the stakes are high. That yearly report used to be an upsum of industry drilling activity and investment plans, with big, impressive numbers for employment and impact. This one admits that the previous £200bn investment forecast for this decade now look more like £160bn, and that's if politicians get off their case. A lot of that is yet to be committed, and industry is proving reluctant to make that commitment while Britain battles over the pace of transition to net zero carbon emissions. This year's report is more of an argument against execution - a plea of mitigation by an industry that has swiftly moved from blue chip to polluting pariah. With four recent tax rises from Conservatives, and Labour wanting to go further with the windfall tax as well as putting the brakes on new licences for drilling, OEUK says Britain is looking increasingly ""uninvestable"". It is reminding the government today that it thought it secured a North Sea Transition Deal three years ago, but doesn't recognise it in the more hostile environment it now faces. The trade body last month made its case to Labour's Treasury team, and says the discussions continue. But it also knows it has to win hearts and minds across the public too. The big carrot of a smooth and successful transition from fossil fuels to renewables could be £450bn of investment by 2040, and many jobs that could go with that. More than half of that big number would be offshore wind power, if governments and regulators can secure the best possible sequence of planning consents and grid connections. A big 'if'. Hydrogen could be worth £25bn - much of it using renewable power, much of it cracking gas. The prospect here is growth to equal the scale of the electricity industry by the middle of the century. Carbon capture and storage could bring £34bn in investment. The controversial bit is the £145bn that the industry reckons could still be invested in oil and gas under British waters. It is emphasised this is not the value of the industry for the big producers associated with outrageously large profits, but the contract value to the supply chain. There is likely to be more public sympathy and a lot more jobs in the companies supplying services and making more modest profits, across drilling, engineering, logistics, shipping, cables and catering, as well as finance, accountancy, law and geology expertise. How many jobs? The OEUK says 200,000 are supported by oil and gas, and UK ministers use that figure to make the case for drilling with more vigour. But the number is being contested by anti-oil campaigners, suggesting that the economic argument is getting some traction. The next bit of the industry's case is that oil and gas should be allowed to keep drilling while it makes the transition into renewable energies. It has mapped skills from one to the other, reckoning oil and gas can provide between 60 and 80% of the expertise required. Ditch that expertise before the renewables investment ramps up, goes the argument, and Britain will have to import skills and equipment, as it already does in large-scale fabrication and shipbuilding. Conversely, retain those skills, deploy them in renewables, and there will be an export market within 15 years worth more than £1,000bn. That's another suspiciously round number. The part of the argument that affects us all is that there is nothing simple about ""just"" stopping oil and gas, when our collective demand and the need for it remains so high. The industry doesn't quite say it, but there's a subliminal message: you depend on our produce, so don't blame us for giving you what you want, and need to lubricate your economy, keep you warm through the winter and go on holiday. Of all the UK's energy needs - across transport, heating, industry and power - oil and gas accounted for around 74% last year. From 2022, demand for gas was down 11% and oil was up 2%, mainly because more planes were flying post-pandemic. Even on the 'balanced pathway' to net zero by 2050, which has been set out by the Committee on Climate Change, oil and gas will continue to provide a fifth of that energy by mid-century. If so, it will then have to be fully offset, much of it by carbon capture and storage (a technology which anti-oil campaigners see as merely an excuse to keep drilling). Production from UK waters met 47% of gas demand last year, and 57% of oil demand (a net figure, because much oil goes overseas for refining, and Britain buys back refined product sourced from lots of places). At 1.2 million daily barrels of oil or its equivalent, that was the lowest output since 1977. It has fallen 28% since 2019, when output was flowing from big investments earlier last decade. OEUK expects annual decline averaging at least 8% per year from now. If investment doesn't keep flowing to tap into further reserves, that declining trend could be as high as 15% per year. Gas output is forecast to fall faster than oil, and at a much faster pace than gas central heating is being replaced. No great loss, you might say. Climate scientists tell us that we cannot sanction more production without busting through 1.5 degrees of warming. But if UK demand declines on current projections, much more imported energy will be required. The liquified gas comes with a much bigger carbon footprint, and as production declines globally, the remaining big exporters may have the rest of us over a barrel. It is not only that tax is weighing heavily on profitability, with Harbour Energy, now the biggest producer from UK waters, recently reporting an effective tax rate of 95%. It is also claimed that the windfall tax is being applied to profits that no longer reflect a windfall. The trade body shows that gas prices are getting close to their levels before Russia started sabre-rattling on the Ukrainian border. Flows have stepped up from Norway and shiploads of Liquified Natural Gas. Oil prices are down from the Ukraine war highs, but are trending at relatively high levels. Since the start of this year, the benchmark Brent crude price has risen from $76 to $87 per barrel. On the other side of the financial equation for oil companies, the cost of drilling the average barrel is up 50%, says OEUK. And without big new fields coming on stream, that unit cost will surely rise. It is claimed the rate of return on investment has dropped to 3% - lower than many other sectors. None of this is likely to win the sympathy of environment campaigners, who note the vast profits made by producers down the years and around the world. But among others, and particularly those contesting the Westminster election due in the next ten months, the industry wants to push back on simple slogans. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Israeli hostages’ relatives arrested at protest as Gaza talks break down","By Yolande Knell",2024-03-27,"Relatives of an Israeli held captive in Gaza were reportedly among those arrested by police at a protest in Tel Aviv, after the latest talks on a truce and the release of hostages broke down. Some family members and activists used cages to block a main road on Tuesday night, as they demanded more be done to free those still being held by Hamas. Their calls have become more desperate since negotiators returned from Qatar. One Israeli official said the indirect talks had reached ""a dead end"". Mediators had been pushing a deal for a six-week halt in Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of 40 of the remaining 130 hostages. At least 30 hostages are presumed dead. About 300 people took part in Tuesday's demonstration outside the Israeli military's headquarters in Tel Aviv - some of them locked in cages, some with placards saying ""no price is too high"". Israeli police said they had arrested four protesters ""following a disturbance"". ""The police acted with the required sensitivity and allowed the protest of some of the hostages' families even though it was not legal,"" a statement added. ""However, some of the protesters decided to go down to Ayalon Highway and block traffic, endangering motorists and themselves."" Israeli media said two of those arrested were relatives of 79-year-old hostage Avraham Munder. They included his nephew, Shahar Mor Zahiro, who later confirmed in a video outside a police station that he had been held for almost three hours. Mr Munder was kidnapped along with his wife Ruth, his daughter Keren, and his grandson Ohad, when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Ruth, Keren and Ohad were released during a week-long ceasefire in November under a deal that saw 105 hostages - most of them women and children - freed in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the state ""should show much more compassion and sensitivity to the families of the hostages"". ""They and their families were abandoned, and their fight is the most just fight there is,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""The minimum is to let them scream out their cries."" There have been almost daily demonstrations by the hostages' families, but their anguish has been heightened by the news that Israeli officials have been recalled from the talks in Doha mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US. On Tuesday, one senior Israeli official close to Mossad director David Barnea - who is heading the Israeli negotiating team - told Reuters news agency that they were ""at a dead end"" because of Hamas's demands. Israel had agreed to double to 700 or 800 the number of Palestinian prisoners it would release in exchange for 40 hostages - including elderly people, women, children and the sick - and also to allow some displaced Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, the official said. Hamas said on Monday that it had rejected the latest truce proposal and that it was sticking to its original position calling for a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The Israeli prime minister's office said Hamas's stance demonstrated its ""utter disinterest"" in a deal and that it showed the ""damage"" done by a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire. But the US said the Israeli statement was ""inaccurate in almost every respect and it is unfair to the hostages and their families"" because Hamas's response had been ""prepared before the UN Security Council vote"". Qatar meanwhile insisted the talks were ""ongoing"" and ""have not stopped"". A halt to the fighting seems as far off as ever on the ground in Gaza, where more than 32,490 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Amid the rising risk of a man-made famine in the north because only a trickle of aid is getting in, this week has again seen crowds waiting for airdrops of food along the coast. However, at least 18 people are said to have died, with graphic videos showing some drowning as they tried to retrieve aid packages from the sea, with others said to have been killed in stampedes.

"What we know about attack on a Moscow concert hall",NA,2024-04-09,"The attack on a Moscow concert hall on 22 March 2024 was the worst in Russia for years. Days after President Vladimir Putin began his fifth term of office, gunmen stormed the complex, killing 145 people and injuring more than 500. The Islamic State group (IS) has said four of its members carried out the attack. This is what is known so far. Crocus City Hall, on the outskirts of Moscow - 20km (12 miles) from the Kremlin - was about to host a concert by the rock group Picnic when gunmen burst into the foyer just after 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Friday evening. Video showed at least four people shooting randomly before proceeding into the concert hall itself and opening fire there. Inside the auditorium, a woman said she and other visitors rushed towards the stage as soon as they realised shots were being fired. ""I saw a person in the stalls with a sidearm and there were cracks [of gunfire] going off, I was trying to crawl behind a loudspeaker,"" she told Russian TV. At some point, fire can be seen inside the hall. Flames later engulfed the facade, while glass on the top two floors of the seven-storey building blew out. ""The terrorists used a flammable liquid to set fire to the concert hall's premises, where spectators were located, including wounded,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said. Helicopters were brought in to drop about 160 tonnes of water, but it took some 10 hours for the fire to be contained. By the time the suspects escaped - according to some accounts, the attack lasted about 20 minutes - hundreds had been killed and injured. Many died from bullet wounds, some as a result of smoke inhalation. Picnic's band members themselves were unharmed. More than 6,000 Russians had flocked to the retail and concert complex for the event. At least 145 have been confirmed dead - six of them children. Some of the more than 500 people who were injured died of their wounds later in hospital. Many of those killed and wounded came from Krasnogorsk, Khimki and other nearby towns on Moscow's north-western fringe. Those who carried out the attack managed to escape the inferno and mayhem they left behind. Russian MP Alexander Khinshtein said the attackers fled in a white Renault car. According to him, police tried to stop the vehicle in the Bryansk region, about 340km (210 miles) from Moscow, managing to arrest two people as the others fled. Some 14 hours after the first reports of shooting, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) announced 11 people had been arrested. Four suspects were dragged into a court in Moscow on Sunday, 24 March, and named as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov. All were charged with an act of terrorism and probably face life in prison. All four are originally from Tajikistan. In a brief statement on the day of the attack, IS said it was behind the attack. It released a photograph of what it said were the four attackers - all masked. The group later released highly graphic footage from the attack. The video, verified by the BBC as genuine, shows one of the gunmen opening fire on several people. Russian authorities have not been too keen to comment on the IS claim, which came two weeks after the US warned of a potential attack targeting ""large gatherings"" in Moscow. Russian officials have complained the US intelligence lacked specific detail. In fact, a week before the attack, President Vladimir Putin said: ""Recent provocative statements by a number of official Westerns structures about the possibility of terrorist attacks in Russia... resembles outright blackmail and an intention to intimidate and destabilise our society."" The US had singled out Islamic State-Khorasan or IS-K, an offshoot which seeks to establish a Muslim caliphate across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Iran. Colin Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst based in New York, was quoted by the New York Times as saying IS-K had been ""fixated"" on Russia for the past two years. He said it ""accuses the Kremlin of having Muslim blood in its hands, referencing Moscow's interventions in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Syria"". Instead of commenting on the IS claim, officials have been eager to point the finger at Ukraine - the neighbour Russia has been at war with since it launched a full-scale invasion on 22 February 2022. ""Based on preliminary information, a window for crossing the border was prepared for them by the Ukrainian side,"" Mr Putin said in the aftermath of the attack. Ukraine swiftly dismissed the Russian claims as ""absolutely untenable and absurd"". But Russian officials have been amplifying the claim, regardless. Russia's state investigative committee alleged that the attack had been financed by funds flowing through a Ukraine-based oil and gas firm, although the company was dissolved in 2023. BBC Verify has been able to match details of two of the alleged attackers who appear in an IS video and an IS-released still image to videos of the arrested suspects posted on pro-Kremlin Telegram channels.

"Climate Choir movement: Using melody for protests","By Emma Elgee",2024-03-16,"A woman who started a climate choir has said they are trying to change people's ""hearts and minds"" about the climate crisis through singing rather than shouting. Jo Flanagan, 61, from Bristol founded the Climate Choir Movement, which has now spread to include 11 other choirs across the UK. The choirs aim to disrupt events by turning up uninvited to sing messages of climate protest. More than 700 people have now joined. Ms Flanagan helped the movement form in January 2023, and it has now expanded to include Portsmouth, Sheffield and Northern Ireland. She said the group had ""hit a nerve"" with people who wanted to protest, but did not want to get arrested. She explained the idea had struck her when she watched a group of Americans standing up and singing God Bless America with alternative words during a conference. She said: ""They walked out singing in harmony with such dignity that I thought 'that is the way to do it'."" Ms Flanagan's first singing action was as a member of Extinction Rebellion, disrupting HSBC's AGM in April 2022. ""It was hard work in the beginning but it grew and grew - we got 30 singers singing in four parts, a version of Abba's Money, Money, Money for that first time."" Then Ms Flanagan realised she wanted to do more, which led to the first Bristol climate choir being born. It was officially founded in January 2023, and by the following year the movement had 12 choirs totalling 700 singers, including one in Ballycastle in Northern Ireland. The Climate Choir Movement holds six large-scale protest actions a year, Ms Flanagan said. On 7 March more than 150 singers protested against the government's decision to allow drilling of the Rosebank oil field at the Palace of Westminster, singing a reworking of the Hallelujah Chorus in St Stephen's Hall. Ms Flanagan said: ""I think we've hit a nerve here. There are a lot of people who think there is something not quite right with nature - they might be gardeners like myself, and you realise there are very few insects. ""Not everyone wants to be a climate activist and I get that, some environmental activism can be quite alienating."" A spokesperson for UK Parliament said: ""The group, who had accessed legitimately and in line with usual processes, briefly gathered and began singing in St Stephen's Hall. ""Although no offence or disruption was caused, this activity was in contravention of the House's rules on access. The individuals were asked to leave and immediately did so."" Ms Flanagan said: ""We are one part of a jigsaw of the environmental movement, we do need the courageous people who would risk their freedom but we also need to have a place for people who aren't activists so much."" The protests have been known to cause a stir, including a flash singing mob in the Science Museum in London in October, and 400 singers singing at an environmental protest in London in April 2023. ""We try and change hearts and minds through singing rather than shouting,"" she added. Jean Pollard, 69, from Bristol, a former social worker, said the good thing about the group was it contained all different types of people. ""It is people across the spectrum that have come together, from all different political parties too,"" she said. She said she had joined because she liked singing but also wanted to express concern about the climate. ""At first, I joined because I do like singing, but it is singing with a purpose and I have been very concerned about the situation, and angry and disappointed with the government,"" she said. Ms Pollard added that she was singing for her grandchildren, because she was fearful for their future. At their recent Bristol rehearsal, more than 100 people gathered, both in person and over Zoom, to be led by choirmasters and musicians. They sing well-known songs such as the Spice Girls' 'Stop Right Now' with new lyrics, or have new pieces composed for them. Duncan Appleby, 35, a music teacher from Guildford, set up a climate choir there in November and has already found 10 members. He said: ""I was looking for a way to connect my climate concerns with my musical life."" Mr Appleby said the ""contradiction"" between the beautiful singing and the protest words meant the choir's message was really sinking in. ""It is so powerful, it's this art that we are bringing into these spaces,"" he said. Ms Flanagan added: ""Singing together is a lovely way of healing, there is such a lot of love in the room. ""There is something about singing that can reach deep down, if you can sing the words with enough soul and heart, there is something about singing that can reach people in a way that if you're just shouting it doesn't have the same impact.""

"Successful Atlantic rowers feared they would be sunk by tanker","By Dan Martin",2024-03-11,"Two rowers cried with joy when they made land after a perilous 3,542-mile (5,700km) voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Brothers-in-law George Nelson and Russell Davis arrived in Antigua on Thursday, 98 days after embarking from Portugal. The pair battled exhaustion, huge waves and feared they would be sunk by an oil tanker during the journey. ""There were times we thought we would die out there,"" Mr Nelson said. He added: ""We prepared as well as anyone could, but it felt like anything on that boat that could break, did break. ""The worst thing was the loss of the solar panels because almost everything depended on us having power. ""When they went, we struggled to navigate and had to rely on good old seamanship. ""There was a point, 1,000 miles from land, when we found ourselves on a collision course with a huge tanker. ""We had no electrical warning system to tell him we were there. We thought he would sink us. ""Luckily he saw us and we were finally able to get him on the radio. He said 'gentlemen, you're a long way from anywhere, are you sure you're OK?' ""That's the point where we could have called it a day. We were exhausted and emotional and there was the temptation to stop. But we stuck at it."" The rowers, from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, were also blown 35 miles (56.3km) off course as their boat, called ""Oar Blimey"", neared their destination, but they finally made it into harbour where loved-ones were waiting for them. Mr Nelson added: ""It was amazing. A boat with a huge Antigua flag came to guide us in with all these massive millionaire's superyachts sounding their horns. ""It felt like the whole island was out to meet us. We both just cried. ""The trip has taken its toll. I've lost a stone and a half. When I got to land my legs didn't work because we've spent so long sitting down in the boat. ""We've both got these big bushy beards - when I saw myself in the mirror I jumped back thinking 'who is that guy?'"" Mr Nelson, 56, said he and Mr Davis, 57, had so far raised £27,215 for Vicky McClure's Our Dementia Choir and Help at Hand, based in Ladybrook Community Centre in Mansfield. They are planning a celebration when they return to the UK later in March. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

"Ukraine-based Russian armed groups claim raids into Russia","By Jaroslav Lukiv",2024-03-12,"Three Ukraine-based Russian paramilitary groups say they have crossed into Russia and are now fighting government troops there. The Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL) and Siberian Battalion (SB) posted videos purportedly showing their fighters in Russia's Belgorod and Kursk regions. The FRL and an exiled Russian politician claimed two villages were now in control of ""liberation forces"". Russia's defence ministry said the breakthrough attempts were thwarted. It claimed more than 234 Ukrainian troops had been killed and several tanks had been destroyed. According to Belgorod's regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, one member of Russia's territorial defence forces was killed and 10 civilians were injured. These numbers have not yet been verified by the BBC. Ukraine's military denied any involvement in Tuesday's cross-border raids. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for the country's military intelligence, said the paramilitary groups were ""independent organisations"" of Russian nationals, and therefore operating ""at home"". In a separate development, Russia said Ukraine had launched 25 drones on targets across Russia, but the attack was thwarted. However, videos have emerged which appear to show several Russian oil facilities on fire. In the Ivanovo region, just east of Moscow, an Il-76 military transport plane with eight crew and seven passengers crashed shortly after take-off, Russia's defence ministry was quoted as saying by Russian state-run news agencies. The ministry said an engine fire caused the crash. It gave no details of survivors. Videos have emerged purportedly showing the plane on fire circling in the sky, and later plumes of black smoke from the crash site. Elsewhere, at least three people were killed and 38 injured on Tuesday night when a Russian missile struck two apartment buildings in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the minister of internal affairs. Ihor Klymenko said children were among the victims and that the number of deaths may go up as the search and rescue operation is continuing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country would ""inflict losses on the Russian state in response - quite rightly"". A full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin is now in its third year, with no signs that the biggest war in Europe since World War Two could end soon. On Tuesday, the FRL posted what it said was a video from the Russian-Ukrainian border. ""Like all our fellow citizens, in the Legion we dream of a Russia freed from Putin's dictatorship. But we don't just dream: we make every effort to make these dreams come true. We will take our land away from the regime, centimetre by centimetre,"" an armed FRL soldier in the footage is heard saying. Meanwhile, the SB said ""fierce fighting is going on the Russian Federation territory"", publishing a clip purportedly showing its fighters engaging with Russian government forces. It also condemned Russian presidential elections on 15-17 March, in which Mr Putin is widely expected to be declared the winner. ""Ballots and polling stations in this case are fiction. You can really change your life for the better only with weapons in your hands,"" the SB said. Another Ukraine-based Russian group, the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK), also published footage of what it said were its fighters engaging with Russian government troops. ""The army of the Kremlin regime lays down its weapons without even starting the battle,"" it said. The videos have not been independently verified. The border village of Tetkino in the Kursk region appeared to be one of the targets in Tuesday's raids, with the FRL claiming that ""liberating forces"" now had full control over the settlement. The BBC has verified the authenticity of FRL footage depicting a strike on an armoured personnel carrier in Tetkino. Kursk Mayor Igor Kutsak ordered all schools in the regional capital to be put on remote learning from 13 to 15 March ""in connection with recent events"". He also warned that the ""missile alert"" regime was still in place in the city, which has a population of more than 400,000. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine-based Russian opposition politician Illya Ponomarev claimed that the border village of Lozovaya Rudka, Belgorod region, was ""under full control of liberating forces"". In a statement later on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry said its forces together with border guards and FSB security service units ""thwarted an attempt by the Kyiv regime to make a breakthrough"" into Russia. It said enemy fighters - backed by tanks and armoured personnel carriers - had tried to invade Russia ""simultaneously in three directions in the areas of the settlements of Odnorobovka, Nekhoteevka and Spodaryushino, Belgorod region"". It added that another four attacks had targeted Tetkino, but were ""repulsed"". The Ukraine-based Russian armed groups have made several cross-border raids since the full-invasion of Ukraine began. Last May, Russia's military said a similar attack in the Belgorod region was rebuffed and armed insurgents defeated. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Hunt says Scottish oil and gas industry is budget loser",NA,2024-03-07,"The chancellor has said that the Scottish oil and gas industry is the loser in his budget after he extended the windfall tax on their profits. Jeremy Hunt announced on Wednesday that the levy on North Sea companies would remain for an additional12 months. It means the 35% surcharge on profits due to high energy prices will continue until 2029 rather than  2028. Many Scottish Conservative politicians, including leader Douglas Ross, had opposed the move. But the chancellor said the industry had to make a ""fair contribution"" from the additional profits of £1.5bn he said they had made due to the war in Ukraine. Wednesday's budget saw Mr Hunt announce measures including a 2p cut in national insurance rates and raising the threshold at which people stop receiving child benefit. When asked on the BBC's Today programme who the losers were from his budget, Mr Hunt said: ""Foreigners who are resident in the UK who were able to pay a cheque and avoid paying tax at the same rate as everyone else - the so-called non doms. ""They are going to be paying significantly more tax. ""I've also asked the Scottish oil and gas industry to pay an additional contribution because the war in the Ukraine is lasting longer and oil and gas prices are going to stay higher for longer. ""So I think it's fair that they make an additional contribution to the cost of living."" Mr Hunt had earlier denied ""throwing Scottish Tories under the bus"" with his decision to extend the windfall tax. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he accepted the extension ""was a difficult decision"" for his Scottish colleagues. The chancellor insisted the UK government continued to support the oil and gas industry which he said had ""an absolutely essential role"" in providing energy security and dealing with the transition to net zero. But he said he had to be fair to taxpayers who have been footing the bill for increasing winter heating payments. Mr Hunt said: ""Taxpayers have spent £94bn in cost of living support, helping pay for around half of people's electricity bills over the last winter."" After the Budget announcement, Douglas Ross said he would not support the legislation needed to pass the extension. He had lobbied the chancellor and prime minister ahead of the budget, warning them that an extension would be the wrong thing to do. Mr Ross has since urged the chancellor to reconsider the decision, which Mr Hunt said he had no plans to do. The Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor in May 2022 as a way of funding help for households facing rising bills as energy prices soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The surcharge on the ""extraordinary profits the oil and gas sector is making"" was initially set at 25% and raised an extra £2.6bn in tax revenues in its first year. It was then extended and raised to 35% by Jeremy Hunt last November, taking the overall tax burden faced by UK oil and gas producers to about 75%. Delivering his budget, Mr Hunt said: ""Because the increase in energy prices caused by the Ukraine war is expected to last longer, so too will the sector's windfall profits - so I will extend the sunset on the Energy Profits Levy for an additional year to 2029, raising £1.5bn."" He said ""generous investment allowances"" would be retained to encourage firms to continue investing. Mr Hunt told Good Morning Scotland on Thursday that ""nothing had been stable since Putin invaded Ukraine"". He added: ""If we are going to give £1,500 in cost of living support to typical households - which is what we've done - then I have to pay for it."" Speaking shortly after the announcement, Mr Ross said: ""I'm not going to hide my disappointment in the fact I urged the chancellor not to extend the windfall levy but that decision was taken to continue for it for a further year. ""I think that's the wrong choice, I think the chancellor took the wrong decision there. I made it clear to him that I won't support that when a bill that will be required in the House of Commons comes back."" Labour has proposed increasing the windfall tax to 38%, taking the overall tax rate to 78%, while the SNP wants it maintained at the current level. The Treasury has promised to scrap the scheme if prices fall to normal levels for a sustained period, which would see the tax rate on energy firms fall to 40% . Industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) has said the extension risked investment, jobs and growth. Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce also criticised the extension, calling it the ""fourth Tory tax raid on the North Sea in two years"" and predicting the levy would make the sector more uncertain. Last month, Aberdeen's Press & Journal newspaper printed a controversial front page describing the Labour leadership as 'traitors' for supporting an extended and raised windfall tax on North Sea profits. This morning the same newspaper accuses the Conservatives of ""selling out"" the oil and gas industry by extending the tax to 2029. The SNP have seized on such criticism and will be keen to amplify it ahead of the general election. After boundary changes, the nationalists lie in second place to the Tories in three newly-drawn North East Scotland constituencies - Aberdeenshire West & Kincardine; Aberdeenshire North & Moray East; and Gordon & Buchan. In opposing the extension to the windfall tax, the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn is keen to link the policy to its potential impact on jobs in Aberdeen, a city he represents in the House of Commons. But the SNP, in government with the Scottish Greens, also faces difficult questions about its energy policy as it pursues ambitious targets to cut carbon emissions. A Scottish government consultation on, among other things, whether to adopt a ""presumption against new exploration for oil and gas"" closed 10 months ago. We are still waiting for the finalised Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan which is due to be published by this summer. When it comes, the document will be scrutinised in minute detail here in Aberdeen and beyond, especially if it appears in the middle of an election campaign. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"How to watch the Oscars and who is nominated","By Emma Saunders",2024-03-10,"The biggest night in the entertainment calendar is finally upon us - the 96th Oscars. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, which has 13 nominations, is expected to sweep up at the ceremony later. Many film fans will also be cheering on Barbie, last year's biggest hit at the box office, which has eight nods. US television host Jimmy Kimmel will be presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and 23:00 (GMT). Here are all the hot talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony  (we've already placed a bet on Margot Robbie wearing pink). More formally known as the Academy Awards, the Oscars have been recognising big screen talent since 1929. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, based in Los Angeles, annually nominate and vote across more than 20 categories including best picture, best actor and best actress. While film awards ceremonies including the Golden Globes and the Baftas attract plenty of attention, the Oscars is the pinnacle of achievement in the awards season calendar. The awards are voted for by Academy members. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, about the life of the man who helped develop the atomic bomb, is leading the charge with 13 nominations including best picture, best actor (Cillian Murphy) and best supporting actress (Emily Blunt). Titanic, Ben Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King jointly hold the record for the most wins with 11, so could Oppenheimer match it or even do better? Its British-born filmmaker Nolan is the hot favourite to pick up best director. While his films have collected Oscars previously, the man behind movies including Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises has never won this prestigious category. In fact, despite his pedigree, he's only been nominated for best director once previously (Dunkirk in 2018). This is surely his year. Four out of five nominated directors this year are European (Nolan has dual US/British citizenship but he was born and grew up here so we're claiming him). If, as widely expected, Oppenheimer's Robert Downey Jr picks up the award for best supporting actor, it will also be a first Oscar win for him. Chasing down Oppenheimer with 11 nods is Yorgos Lanthimos's brilliantly bizarre Poor Things. Its star, Emma Stone, is a frontrunner in the best actress race alongside Lily Gladstone from Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. If Gladstone triumphs - and it's hard to call at this point - she will be the first Native American to win the award. Killers of the Flower Moon, about the murder of members of the Osage Indian tribe by white settlers who are after their oil, scored 10 nominations in total. Scorsese has now been nominated for a best director Oscar 10 times, which makes him the most nominated living director in Academy Awards history. He's also the oldest best director nominee at 81. His long-time collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker is the most nominated editor in history with nine nods, and this could be a record-breaking fourth win for her (she currently holds the joint record with three wins). Unless you've been hiding under a rock since Christmas (and we've all felt like doing it in this weather), Barbie director Greta Gerwig and the film's star, Margot Robbie, missed out on individual nominations when they were announced in January. Barbie did land eight nods in total though, with America Ferrera and Ryan Gosling recognised in the best supporting actress and supporting actor categories respectively. But it's still not Kenough for some. All the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by French courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall, romantic drama Past Lives, Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro, incisive satire American Fiction, warm comedy tale The Holdovers and chilling Nazi drama The Zone of Interest. The Barbenheimer juggernaut that sparked a thousand memes has done the Oscars no harm this year; the commercial success of these two films which have put bums on seats and also won over the critics, may bring new audiences to this year's event. While some categories appear to have it all wrapped up - The Holdovers' Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Oppenheimer's Robert Downey Jr have picked up pretty much every film prize going in the run-up to the Oscars - there could still be some surprises in store. The race for best actress between Stone and Gladstone is too close to call, but could Gladstone's recent Screen Actors Guild (SAG) win get her over the line? That's what happened with Michelle Yeoh last year. However, Stone has the showier role as Poor Things' charming protagonist Bella Baxter, while Gladstone's dignified and resilient Molly Kyle in Flower Moon is a more understated part that enjoys considerably less screen time. It's an intriguing contest. Best actor is also up in the air with Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers) and Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) in a two-horse race, although Murphy seems to have his nose in front following recent wins at Bafta and SAG. If he wins, he will be the first Irish-born actor to triumph, although Daniel Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won three best actor Oscars previously. In best picture, could The Holdovers pull an Argo, winning best picture for a film in which the director (Alexander Payne) isn't nominated for best director? It will take some doing to overhaul the Oppenheimer steamroller, but stranger things have happened. Slightly in the realms of fantasy now, but if Rustin's Colman Domingo also pulls off a big shock by winning the Oscar for best actor for playing gay Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin, he will be the first Afro-Latino actor to win the prize. And there are people of colour in every acting category. Jodie Foster was nominated for best supporting actress for her portrayal of the gay swimming coach Bonnie Stoll in Nyad. It's the first time two gay actors have been nominated for playing two gay characters in the same year. There's progress elsewhere, too. But it's slow progress. Anatomy of a Fall's Justine Triet is only the eighth woman to be nominated for best director (the Oscars director branch is made of up 75% men). However a record three films directed by women - Triet, Gerwig and Celine Song (Past Lives) - are up for best picture (out of a possible 10). Other categories are also worth paying attention to - the short film and short animation categories are buckling under the strain of stardust this year. Both shortlists are worth checking out in their own right but some names you might recognise include Wes Anderson, who has directed The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, a Roald Dahl adaptation starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Ralph Fiennes and Dev Patel. Meanwhile, David Olewoyo stars in Misan Harriman's The After, which tackles grief. And Robbie Robertson could pick up a posthumous Oscar for best score for Killers of the Flower Moon. He sadly died aged 80 in August last year. Dave Mullins, who worked at Pixar for 20 years, wrote and directed animated short War is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko. The famous pair's son, Sean Lennon, is the executive producer. Anyone who is anyone will be there, is the short answer. Most of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet (we think it's red anyway, last year they switched to a champagne colour but it got dirty very quickly). Presenters include Zendaya, Al Pacino, Lupita Nyong'o, Bad Bunny, Dwayne Johson, Regina King, Matthew McConaughey, Mahershala Ali, Ke Huy Quan, Brendan Fraser and Michelle Pfeiffer. Never mind the A-listers, we're hoping Messi, the dog from Anatomy of a Fall, makes another star appearance. The best song nominees will all perform, including Barbie's Ryan Gosling and Mark Ronson with I'm Just Ken. Gosling gave a hilarious reaction to the song's win at the Critics' Choice Awards earlier this year - bemused and almost suspicious. Billie Eilish will also sing her Barbie track, the favourite to win, What Was I Made For? US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel returns to hosting duties this year - it will be his fourth time, including his stint at the helm last year, which marked a smooth return after the chaos of 2022's ceremony when Will Smith slapped one of the awards presenters, Chris Rock. Kimmel joked when his return was announced: ""I always dreamed of hosting the Oscars exactly four times."" We bet it's not his last, though. The 2024 Oscars will air live on Sunday 10 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002. The show can be watched in the US on ABC and on various streaming services. It's also broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories. In the UK, you might actually be able to stay awake to watch this year. The awards start an hour earlier and the clocks in Los Angeles - PST - go forward an hour on Oscars Sunday. The show starts at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT). UK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30. As well as Nolan, other Brits in the running include Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Carey Mulligan (Maestro), Jonathan Glazer (director, The Zone of Interest), Jacqueline Durran (costume design, Barbie) and Holly Waddington (costume design, Poor Things). And what about this for an effort? Special effects whizz Neil Corbould (who already has two Oscars under his belt) is up for three this year in the visual effects category for The Creator, Napoleon and Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. Meanwhile, if Sandra Huller picks up best actress (Anatomy of a Fall) she will be the first German to do so in 60 years. It's also the first time two international films not in the English language have been nominated for best picture in the same year (Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest).

"Rochdale by-election: Landslide win for George Galloway","By Jennifer McKiernan",2024-03-01,"George Galloway is back in Parliament with a resounding win in the Rochdale by-election after a campaign in which the Gaza war was a running theme. ""Keir Starmer - this is for Gaza,"" the former Labour MP said, after polling 12,335 votes, nearly 6,000 more than any other candidate. Mr Galloway will take his Commons seat for the Workers Party of Britain. Labour had withdrawn support for candidate Azhar Ali over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. Mr Ali apologised for his remarks. Mr Galloway has previously been an MP for Labour until 2003, then in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015. Smaller parties left the mainstream candidates in the dust in the Rochdale vote, which was sparked by the death of Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd, with second place going to independent and local businessman Dave Tully. In his victory speech, Mr Galloway highlighted the local voters' rejection of the two main parties in Westminster. He said: ""Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked tonight here in Rochdale."" He was interrupted by a heckler accusing him of being a climate change denier, before she was shouted down by his supporters, and had orange confetti thrown over him by rival candidate Rev Mark Coleman, a Just Stop Oil supporter. But none of this fazed the 69-year-old, who went on to warn that his former party would ""pay a high price"" for ""enabling, encouraging and covering for the catastrophe"" in Gaza. Mr Galloway has long agitated for causes related to the Middle East, including for Palestinian rights, and has regularly stood for election in constituencies with a high Muslim population, such as Rochdale. He told the BBC he had 60 Workers Party colleagues willing to stand in the general election and there would be ""a shifting of the tectonic plates in scores of parliamentary constituencies"". ""It's true that every Muslim is bitterly angry at Keir Starmer and his misnamed Labour party - but you would be very foolish if you didn't realise that millions of other citizens of our country are too,"" he said. ""Beginning here in the north west, in the west Midlands, in London, from Ilford to Bethnal Green and Bow, Labour is on notice that they have lost the confidence of millions of their voters who loyally and traditionally voted for them, generation after generation."" As well as pledging to save the town's football club from ""extinction"", Mr Galloway hailed the ""remarkable achievement"" of Mr Tully in coming second in the poll as an independent candidate campaigning on local issues. Mr Tully, who got 6,638 votes, is well-known in Rochdale as he runs a garage business and is involved with the town's rugby club. Despite never being involved in politics before, he said he stood in the by-election because he wanted ""to be the voice of Rochdale"". ""I feel I've turned the heads of people who don't usually vote because nothing ever really changes with mainstream politics and parties,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. The Conservative candidate Paul Ellison came in third place with 3,731 votes, the suspended Labour candidate Azhar Ali in fourth with 2,402, and Iain Donaldson came fifth for the Liberal Democrats with 2,164. The Reform Party had hopes this by-election could be a breakthrough for them as they fielded Simon Danczuk, the former Labour MP for Rochdale, but he was beaten into sixth place with 1,968 votes. Mr Galloway's party was only formed in 2019 and because it therefore did not field a candidate in Rochdale in the general election, Mr Galloway recorded a historic 41% swing against Labour in the vote. He also told the BBC afterwards that he had achieved political history in another way, matching Winston Churchill as the only MP to represent four separate towns and cities in the House of Commons. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Galloway only won because Labour withdrew support from its own candidate. He apologised to voters for this but said it was ""the right decision"". ""Obviously we will put a first-class candidate and a unifier before the voters in Rochdale at the general election,"" he added. Former Rochdale Labour council leader Alan Brett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not think Mr Galloway would have won if the Labour Party's selection process had not been mishandled. He added: ""I don't think he's for Rochdale - I think he's for himself - I don't think he cares about Rochdale."" The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) said it was ""extremely concerned"" by Mr Galloway's victory, accusing him of having an ""atrocious record of baiting the Jewish community"", including calling for Bradford, when he was an MP there, to be declared an ""Israel-free zone"". His victory comes amid concerns the war in the Middle East is inflaming community tensions in the UK, fuelling a rise in hate crimes and leading to MPs reporting that threats have been made personally against them. Veteran political pollster Sir John Curtice told the BBC the Rochdale result will intensify pressure on Sir Keir Starmer to toughen up Labour's stance on Israel. However he doubted there would be much impact on the general election result, because it is ""unlikely that anybody else has the ability to... exploit this issue [the war in Gaza] in the way that Mr Galloway is uniquely able to"".

"Ukraine war: Kharkiv Opera and Ballet to reopen underground","By Sarah Rainsford",2024-03-05,"If you want to go to a concert in Kharkiv these days, you have to know who to ask. In Ukraine's second city, just 40 kilometres from the Russian border, mass gatherings have been banned since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. Most cultural events that do take place are not advertised to make sure they do not get shelled. But after two years of near-silence, the Kharkiv National Opera and Ballet is about to burst back into sound - underground. ""We want to bring life back to Kharkiv, including cultural life,"" the theatre's general director, Ihor Touluzov, explains. ""Demand for any kind of cultural event here is really high."" The bunker theatre is being prepared beneath the main auditorium, down several flights of stairs. It has no dress circle, chandeliers or champagne - and a lot of grey concrete. But follow the sound of music and it leads to a raised stage with spotlights and rows of seats. Most importantly, there's a company of singers, dancers and musicians desperate to perform before a proper audience again. ""We really miss our big hall, the feeling of being on a big stage with lots of people watching,"" violinist Natalia Babarok explains. The artists have only been able to use the main stage upstairs a handful of times since February 2022, because it is not safe. The giant fire curtain is firmly down with scattered props and bits of scenery abandoned on stage behind it: a throne, a bicycle and racks of bright-coloured costumes. In the first weeks after the full-scale invasion, when Russian troops were closest and the shelling most intense, a missile landed near to the theatre. Chunks of stone were torn from the side of the building and windows blown out. The roof caught fire several times, but staff managed to extinguish the flames before they took hold. The risk to life remains even now, long after the Russian troops were forced back from the city limits. ""A rocket can hit here from Belgorod in Russia in 45 seconds. It's really not safe to have a lot of people in one place,"" the director explains. Just over a month ago, a barrage of Russian missiles hit residential areas of the city, killing 11 people. Seven more civilians died in early February when an oil depot was struck in a drone attack and fire tore down their street. Three of those killed were young children. When the main theatre closed in February 2022, Volodymyr Kozlov did not stop singing. Thousands of Kharkiv residents were living on the metro then, staying underground away from the explosions. So Volodymyr and a group of fellow artists would tour the stations, performing three concerts a day, a mixture of classical music and popular tunes. When he was not singing, Volodymyr was helping to evacuate residents from the areas under heaviest fire or delivering food and other supplies. ""It was impossible to stop, because if you did then the thoughts [of danger] would enter your head, and you couldn't let them,"" the baritone explains. We met during a recent rehearsal for the company's first big production in the basement theatre. Volodymyr is performing alongside his wife, Yulia Forsyuk, a soprano soloist who plays the lead role in the Ukrainian opera, Natalka Poltavka. The couple moved to Slovakia briefly at the start of the war, when the whole company was invited there to continue working in exile. But Volodymyr and Yulia couldn't settle abroad. Back home, the singing couple began travelling to play for Ukrainian troops on the frontline. Volodymyr remembers one of their first trips: ""When we arrived in Shchastye we were told: 'Give your concert, but by six o'clock you can't be here.' Then at five to six, the mortars began coming in."" He acts out the story as he speaks, arms waving energetically. ""We heard the whistle, jumped into our bus and sped off along the battered road at 140 kilometres an hour!"" Yulia remembers the trips as rewarding as well as nerve-wracking. She had not known in advance where exactly they were going. ""When we got there, they were shooting just a kilometre and a half away!"" Their repertoire was mostly pop and variety numbers with some folk music: ""Something fun,"" as the soprano describes it. ""We were able to lift the troops' mood a bit, the soldiers even danced a little with us and they cried during some sad songs."" Now the pair are rehearsing to perform for Kharkiv residents again, safely beneath the city streets. But it's not just the surroundings and acoustics that are different. More than half of the company are still in Slovakia; one man was killed fighting on the frontline and several more have been mobilised; others are scattered as refugees. For those who have stayed in Kharkiv, everything is being adjusted to their reduced new reality. ""Our director adapts the score to feel like everyone's still there,"" Natalia Babarok describes the changes for the orchestra. ""My husband plays the trombone, but he's told to play the bassoon and the horn parts too. As a violinist, I might also play the part of the flute. You have to play for yourself, and for someone else."" The company are already putting on secret concerts, advertised only by word of mouth and for small audiences. They are waiting for final clearance from the Kharkiv military administration to begin staging larger-scale productions. There has been an increase in Russian missile attacks lately, which might explain the continuing caution of the authorities. When the theatre does finally throw open its underground doors to a wider public, they will notice another change. ""We refuse to play Russian works now,"" general director Ihor Touluzov says. ""It's a difficult issue but during the war, it's the right decision."" Even the greatest Russian composers - Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov - have all been eliminated from the theatre repertoire, about 40% of what the company used to perform. ""Every action, every event connected with the Russians is perceived with pain,"" the director explains. ""Right now, I realise there can be no compromise."" The director has great faith in the power of culture: he hopes reopening the theatre, even a subterranean stage, will help entice people home. He wants to show that life - like the show - goes on. ""We love our city and we want our citizens to come back from other cities and abroad."" The artists are impatient for that moment. ""Of course, when serious shelling starts again, the good mood goes,"" Yulia says. ""But our work is what saves us. And [it saves] our audience, who are so happy that we can at least show them something."" Her husband agrees. ""Everything was grey before, and there was no future,"" Volodymyr says. ""Now a rainbow has appeared on the horizon."" Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

"Climate protesters guilty of trespass at Wimbledon","By James W Kelly & PA Media",2024-02-26,"Three Just Stop Oil protesters have been found guilty of storming the Wimbledon tennis courts with confetti and puzzle pieces. Deborah Wilde, 69, Simon Milner-Edwards, 67, and William Ward, 66, were found guilty of aggravated trespass at City of London Magistrates' Court on Monday. The trio scaled a barrier and threw the items on the court during the third day of The Championships tournament in July. All three admitted entering the court but denied it amounted to the charge of aggravated trespass. After the verdict was delivered, deputy district judge Steven Jonas said: ""Firstly I want to thank all of the defendants for the way they've conducted themselves this evening, all of you will have been very stressed. He said it was ""not in dispute"" that each defendant ""sprinkled some confetti or tinsel and some jigsaw pieces on to that playing field"" and said he ""found it a fact"" that they were trespassing. He accepted that the three protesters waited for a break in play, but added: ""Nevertheless, I find as a fact that each of them intended to cause disruption to the tennis and as a result, they did cause some disruption on that day."" The three defendants, all of whom were self-represented, were told they could not use the threat of climate change as a defence. The court was told Wilde and Milner-Edwards entered Court 18 at around 14:10 BST on 5 July last year, during the Grand Slam match between Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov and Japan's Sho Shimabukuro. Bodycam footage played to the court showed them wearing Just Stop Oil T-shirts. Giving evidence in the trial, Michelle Dite, operations director at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), which runs the competition, said Wilde and Milner-Edwards threw ""around 1,000"" puzzle pieces from a jigsaw that had been purchased at the Wimbledon grounds, as well as confetti. When she arrived, the scene looked ""very unsettling"" and the players appeared ""very frustrated, probably quite intimidated"", she said. She added: ""There (was) glitter, flutter-fetti - orange - and jigsaw puzzle pieces that have been spread around different parts of the court; either side of the net."" Wimbledon staff cleared the jigsaw pieces and confetti by hand and using leaf blowers, she added. The pair were arrested at 14:16 BST. Around two hours later, Ward, also captured on bodycam footage wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt, went onto the same court. By that time, British player Katie Boulter had started competing against Australia's Daria Saville. Ms Dite claimed Ward's protest was met with louder ""boos"" from the crowd, many of whom had already witnessed the first incident. That year AELTC spent ""hundreds of thousands of pounds"" to manage potential protests after Just Stop Oil demonstrated at the World Snooker Championships and Ashes Test at Lord's Cricket Ground, she said. Court 18 is a show court, where many top seeds play in front of ""a few hundred"" people and there is extensive video coverage, Ms Dite added. Wilde and Ward were each given a six-month conditional discharge, while Milner-Edwards received an 18-month conditional discharge.

"Lee Anderson wrong to conflate Muslims with extremism, No 10 says","By Becky Morton",2024-02-27,"The prime minister believed Lee Anderson's comments about Sadiq Khan were unacceptable because they conflated ""all Muslims with Islamist extremism"", Downing Street has said. The former Tory deputy chairman was suspended from the party after refusing to apologise for saying ""Islamists"" had ""got control"" of the London mayor. The PM's official spokesman said the language he used was ""wrong"". But he added that Rishi Sunak did not believe Mr Anderson was racist. ""It's unacceptable obviously to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism or the extreme ideology of Islamism,"" he said. ""That's why the PM regarded those comments as wrong and unacceptable."" During a discussion on GB News on Friday, Mr Anderson said: ""I don't actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London, and they've got control of Starmer as well."" The MP for Ashfield was suspended from the parliamentary party on Saturday after refusing to apologise, and now sits as an independent. Speaking to BBC East Midlands Today, Mr Anderson said he stuck by the ""sentiment"" of his words but that he ""should have clarified his comments about the London mayor"". He said he was angry about weekly protests ""causing mayhem"" in the capital city but that he should have ""broadened out"" his criticism to include how demonstrations by groups such as Black Lives Matter, Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion were policed. On Monday, Mr Sunak said Mr Anderson was suspended because his comments were ""wrong"" and not acceptable. However, he has avoided calling them Islamophobic, prompting Labour to accuse the PM of being too ""weak"" to do so. Home Secretary James Cleverly joined calls for Mr Anderson to apologise on Monday, saying his comments were not ""accurate"" or ""fair"". However, Mr Anderson has also received support from some Conservative MPs, including Jacob Rees-Mogg. The former minister said his comments were ""infelicitous"" but ""his concerns about Islamism are entirely legitimate"" and he should not have been suspended from the party. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman is also said to think his suspension is an overreaction. Mr Anderson has acknowledged his words ""may have been clumsy"" but said apologising ""would be a sign of weakness"" as he believes he is right. In an interview on Monday with GB News - who employ him as a broadcaster - he argued pro-Palestinian protests outside Parliament and threats to MPs showed Mr Khan had ""lost control of the city"". Pressed over whether he would join the right-wing Reform UK party, the former Labour councillor declined to comment but said he had ""been on a political journey"". Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Scully has apologised for suggesting parts of London and Birmingham are ""no-go areas"". Speaking to BBC Radio London on Monday he had called Mr Anderson's comments ""inflammatory"" and urged him to apologise. However, the former minister also said he could see what he was ""trying to drive at"", going on to say parts of Tower Hamlets in London and Sparkhill in Birmingham were ""no-go areas"". His remarks were criticised by figures including the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who called them ""nonsense slurs"". In another interview with the station on Tuesday Mr Scully said he ""put his hands up"" for using language he ""regrets"". ""What I was trying to say, I thought I was being specific about but clearly not, is the fact that a lot of the conversation, and the vacuum that's allowed to then be filled by populists, is when prejudice builds up because of perception,"" he said. ""There are areas of this country where there are tiny, tiny groups of people that cause people to feel uncomfortable in particular areas. ""That might be a white gang, that might be a black gang, a Muslim gang, whatever, and that then tends to write off whole communities for some people."" The Sutton and Cheam MP described this line of thinking as ""totally inappropriate"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Luton gardens flooded by 'mini-river of sewage'","By Nicola Haseler",2024-02-20,"Residents are concerned for their children's safety after a ""mini-river of sewage"" flooded their gardens. People living on Barn Owl Close, Luton, said the deluge carried on for several hours until Thames Water was able to stop it. The housing association, Stonewater Housing, said they are investigating the cause of the problem. A Thames Water spokesperson revealed the ""external flooding was caused by a blockage"". Parent Natasha Dennie said the houses were surrounded six inches of raw sewage on Saturday afternoon and several residents immediately reported it to the housing association. ""There was faeces and tissue and muck pouring out of the drains,"" she said. ""Even when my children were drinking bottled water my children said they could taste poo because it was just in our noses. ""I had to get my children to go to my mum's as they started feeling ill."" Stacy Gordon said she heard bubbling noises coming from her downstairs toilet. ""When I came outside the smell got even more potent and I realised there was a mini-river of sewage running down the street,"" she said. She said the smell was ""unbearable"" and is still using bottled water out of concern for the safety of her children. Ms Gordon believes the street has been ""let down by the housing association"" who she believes did not react quickly enough. Thames Water said: ""Our engineers used jets to clear the blockage, restoring our sewage pipes to normal working order and stopping the flooding. ""Our team completed a clean-up, which consists of disinfecting affected areas, removing waste and washing down areas with water."" The water company said the flooding was caused by ""sewage misuse"" from residents disposing of oil and grease in their drains. It said: ""It's important that customers only flush the three p's; pee, poo and paper in order to prevent blockages."" A statement from Stonewater Housing said it is ""really sorry that customers in Barn Owl Close have been affected by a sewage overflow over the weekend"". It added: ""A specialist team will be organising to thoroughly clean the area and in the meantime we will make contact with all the households to discuss any support they may need."" Luton Borough Council said it was ""sorry to hear about the sewage leak"" on Barn Owl Close. It said if the mess remains on Tuesday morning they are ""committed to sending a team over to remove the waste from the street as soon as possible"".

"Prevent counter-terror scheme failures leave public at risk - ex-adviser","By Henry Zeffman",2024-02-21,"The man who reviewed the government's counter-terror scheme last year says key recommendations he made have been ignored - leaving the public ""at risk"". Sir William Shawcross suggested Prevent was failing to identify terrorist sympathisers and there was an increased risk in the UK due to the war in Gaza. The Home Office said it had implemented almost all of Sir William's proposals, and would eventually enact them all. Prevent is a key part of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy. In practical terms, the scheme places public bodies - including schools and the police - under a legal duty to identify people who may turn to extremism, and intervene in their lives before it is too late. On Tuesday, ministers marked a year since the publication of Sir William's independent review by declaring that they had ""brought Prevent back to its core mission"". ""The whole counter-terrorism system needs to continually evolve and adapt to the ever-changing threat from terrorism,"" Home Secretary James Cleverly said in a progress report. ""Thanks to the work undertaken in response to [Sir William's] review, we have a first-class Prevent programme that can play a central role in this effort."" But Sir William - who was appointed to conduct his review when Boris Johnson was prime minister - said that the ""glass is still only half full"". ""The government has published a report saying that they have made some of those changes that I asked for, that I proposed - but not enough,"" he said, speaking to the BBC a day after the government's progress report. Sir William added ministers had ""ignored"" some of his key recommendations - ""and I think as a result the public is at risk"". He said he felt more worried about extremism in the UK after Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel, and that the government - through Prevent - ""should pay much more attention to the Hamas support network"". ""There are unfortunately quite a lot of Hamas sympathisers and some operatives in this country,"" Sir William said, adding: ""Prevent and the police should have been working much harder against those Hamas people in this country."" Sir William found in his 2023 review that the scheme had repeatedly ""failed"" to identify attackers - and there was a ""sense of lost purpose"" in the scheme. Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, he continued: ""The public are more at risk because of the events of 7 October and subsequently - and many, many people in this country are much more frightened than they have ever been before."" The Metropolitan Police has previously said the conflict in the Middle East had a ""profound and polarising impact here in London"". When he was appointed to lead the review into Prevent, Sir William was criticised by a range of civil rights campaign groups, including some who accused him of having anti-Islamic views. But crucially his review was always defended by the government, whose actions he is now questioning. Government sources pointed out that the most recent statistics on Prevent referrals end in March 2023, arguing that they therefore did not reflect any effects his recommendations might have had on government policy. A Home Office spokesperson said the government had made ""significant progress to deliver a strengthened Prevent"". ""William Shawcross's Review was critical to ensuring Prevent is fit for purpose, which is why we accepted his recommendations in full,"" the spokesperson continued. ""One year on, we have delivered 30 of the 34 recommendations he made, and we are making rapid progress on delivering the remaining four. ""The government agrees that extreme Islamist ideology presents the greatest threat to the UK, and has moved swiftly to update Prevent duty guidance and training to make that clear.""

"Newspaper headlines: Starmer 'attacks Trump' and 'No way back for Harry'","By BBC News",2024-02-18,"The death of the Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny, continues to make Sunday's headlines. The Sunday Times says Russian intelligence officers are reported to have visited his prison two days before he died there. Human rights campaigners claim the FSB disconnected and dismantled security cameras and listening devices. The Sunday Telegraph suggests Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, could step into her husband's shoes as the Kremlin's chief foe. The paper says her ""years of strength and unwavering commitment to the cause of freedom in Russia"" mean she is ready. ""Don't let Navalny's death be in vain"", is the message from the editorial in the Sun on Sunday. The paper says what happened to him ""must unite the West like never before against Vladimir Putin's murderous tyranny"". The Observer is equally emphatic. ""Putin must be shown he can't kill with impunity,"" reads the headline of its editorial. The paper calls for the West to break off diplomatic relations with Moscow. ""Expel its lying, scheming diplomats"" it says, and ""send them all packing"". The Sunday Telegraph leads on what it calls a ""broadside"" from the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, towards Donald Trump after the US presidential hopeful's criticisms of Nato. Mr Trump has said the United States will ""not protect"" alliance members that fail to meet defence spending targets. According to the Telegraph, Sir Keir has insisted that, if he is elected Prime Minister, Britain will always stand up for its allies ""even if others threaten not to"". The Sunday Mirror reports that the government might call the general election in May. One former Conservative minister is quoted as saying a poll then would avoid challenges to Rishi Sunak's leadership and a damaging race to replace him. The Sunday Times, though, says the election is still expected in October or November. The paper also reports there are predictions that up to 150 Tories could announce they are quitting as MPs if polls continue to suggest Labour is on course for a landslide. The Mail on Sunday says it's discovered that activists from environmentalist group Just Stop Oil are planning a ""sinister nationwide blitz"" to occupy MPs' homes ahead of the general election. The paper says protestors told its undercover reporter they were ready to look a ""bit loony"" to get attention for their cause. A Just Stop Oil spokesman is quoted accusing paper of getting ""in a tizz"" about ""ordinary people taking the power back"". And finally, the Observer says the mainstay of casual conversation, the unexpected state of the weather, is under existential threat. The paper reports that scientists are beginning research to determine weather patterns a month into the future. While one of the experts from Reading University has stressed it will not be possible to predict if a particular day will be rainy or sunny, the researchers hope to be able to say if we are likely to experience a very wet or windy period four weeks in advance.

"Ukraine war: A front-line town torn between determination and despair","By Andrew Harding",2024-02-19,"No one town can capture the mood of this huge, struggling nation, after almost two years of war. But perhaps Lyman comes close. This is a small, half-ruined railway town, first seized by Russia, then liberated, and now trapped, precariously, near the frontlines of the Donbas. Its civilian inhabitants seem torn between determination and despair. ""Only peace matters now. I want peace. Only peace. On any terms,"" said Oleksandr Rogovitz, a 74-year-old retired businessman, living alone in the icy ruins of a nine-storey apartment block on the edge of Lyman. When we first met Oleksandr and his eight cats exactly one year ago, hours after a powerful Russian missile had torn apart one side of his building, he shared the widespread belief that Ukraine could still win this war. ""Now I've had time to think, and I have changed my mind. Too many people are dying,"" he said last week, suggesting the time had come to trade land for peace with Russia. It's not an opinion you hear too often in Ukraine, and may, perhaps, be rarely felt. But it does illustrate the impact that unending months of conflict appear to be having on a weary population. A few explosions, muffled by the forest and a fresh layer of snow, boomed across town from the direction of the front lines, still some 15km (nine miles) to the east, as Oleksandr, looking drawn and unwashed, shuffled away towards a dark stairwell. The failure of Ukraine's counter-offensive last year is clearly weighing heavily on many in Lyman. Too close to the front to qualify for major reconstruction funds from the central government, the town's council is limited to paying pensions, trying to restore electricity, and sending work parties out to trim trees. The main bridge into town remains a bombed ruin. ""Our youth are being exterminated. If this continues there will be no Ukraine left,"" said Nadezhda Anatolievna, 80, as the sound of another distant explosion echoed, almost unnoticed, around the yard where she and other pensioners were queuing for food donations. ""It seems to me this war will go on for a long time,"" said Natalia Martynenko, 63, stamping her feet in the freezing cold. But the gloom is not shared by everyone here. The town, built in a forest clearing around a once important railway junction, which is now a scrawl of broken rails and cables, is still home to several hundred children, who now study online but often gather at a dozen small meeting points to get help with their homework and to visit friends. ""I have everything I need. I don't want anything else, except peace and calm,"" said 14-year-old Anya, giggling with three friends at the back of a warm classroom. They all agreed they'd got used to this new way of life, which was now ""normal"". When we visited a year ago, many people in Lyman were living in their cellars, having endured the Russian bombardment and occupation of Lyman, and its subsequent liberation by Ukrainian troops. Last week, on Railway Street, several members of the Dmytrenko family were still sleeping underground. ""Our flat was destroyed. Where else can we go?"" asked Mariia Dmytrenko, glancing away from a television attached to the cellar wall. But she welcomed the fact that more shops were open, electricity was now uninterrupted, and her daughter Irina, a railway accountant, had found a new job working for the council. ""It's slightly better than it was a year ago. Thank God there is public transport and other services. We're all tired, physically and mentally. But we're waiting for victory. I don't think [negotiations] are possible after so many people have been killed. How can you negotiate with murderers?"" said 42-year-old Irina, adding that she felt that any Russian sympathisers in Lyman had long since left town. The mayor of Lyman, Oleksandr Zhuravlov, recently moved his office to a new building, hoping to avoid being targeted by Russian missiles. He said he had no right to admit to being tired, or pessimistic, but did admit to being worried about news reports suggesting the US might stop sending arms to Ukraine. ""We need to agree on an extension of military assistance, because, as you know, we are fighting a monster. A monster with plenty of oil and gas resources with which to buy weapons. For now, our military is holding on as best they can… but they lack weapons and ammunition and this is a big concern."" The town has plans in case another evacuation is required. But there are other pressing concerns, including the fact that not a single piece of farmland in the area has been cleared of mines. As we prepared to drive out of Lyman, a cluster of distant explosions rattled the few windows still in place on Railway Street. Just beyond the edge of town, trucks had pulled over in the snow to collect hundreds of pine logs, cut and trimmed by a team of workmen. We were told the logs would probably be used to help reinforce the defensive trenches that Ukraine is now building, as fast as it can, as it prepares to counter another Russian offensive that could well threaten Lyman and its remaining inhabitants once again.

"Photographer arrested at Just Stop Oil protest gets payout","By Bob Dale & Ted Hennessey",2024-02-15,"A photographer arrested during a Just Stop Oil petrol station protest on the M25 has received a payout from Surrey Police. Peter Macdiarmid, 59, said he was handcuffed at Clacket Lane Services on 24 August 2022 and detained for several hours, despite holding a UK press card. He had been photographing activists blocking access to the petrol station by sitting in the road with banners. Surrey Police confirmed it had reached a settlement with Mr Macdiarmid. After Mr Macdiarmid was arrested, law firm Bhatt Murphy sent a letter of claim to Surrey Police on his behalf and last December the force offered to settle out of court. The force has not accepted liability or apologised for its actions, the British Press Photographers' Association (BPPA) said. Surrey Police's lawyers allegedly denied the officers did anything wrong, saying the situation they found when they arrived was confusing and they had acted within the law. Some Just Stop Oil protesters put fuel pumps out of use by breaking the display glass and covering them with spray paint. Mr Macdiarmid said: ""I have been a news photographer for 37 years and have covered many events where tensions were running high and police were under great pressure. ""This Just Stop Oil protest was not like that, it was very calm and protesters were voluntarily giving themselves up for arrest when a police officer decided to detain me on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. ""I was unable to persuade the arresting officer that I was a genuine working press photographer and my press card was ignored."" The BPPA said: ""In the end Peter has received damages and his costs, but would rather have not had to go through a lengthy and stressful legal process to clear his name."" Surrey Police confirmed it had reached a settlement with the claimant which was accepted. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram. Send your story ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk.

"Rochdale by-election: Keir Starmer apologises to voters after George Galloway win",NA,2024-03-01,"Sir Keir Starmer has apologised to voters in Rochdale for disowning Labour's by-election candidate but insisted it was ""the right decision"". George Galloway stormed to victory in the contest, with Labour's suspended candidate Azhar Ali a distant fourth. Mr Galloway described the result as Sir Keir's ""worst nightmare"". The Labour leader said Mr Galloway had only won because Labour had withdrawn support for Mr Ali over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. Independent candidate David Tully - a local businessman - came a surprise second, beating the Conservatives into third place. In his victory speech, Mr Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Britain, described Sir Keir and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as ""two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked tonight here in Rochdale"". Mr Galloway has long campaigned on causes related to the Middle East, including for Palestinian rights and said his victory was ""for Gaza"". He warned the Labour leader that his party would ""pay a high price"" for ""enabling, encouraging and covering for the catastrophe"" in the region. Speaking after the defeat, Sir Keir said: ""I regret we had to withdraw our candidate, and apologise to voters in Rochdale. ""I took that decision. It was the right decision."" He promised that Labour would put forward ""a first-class candidate, a unifier"" to fight the seat at the general election, expected later this year. Mr Sunak said the Rochdale contest had been ""one of the most divisive campaigns that we have seen in recent times"" but that the Tories had ""run a really positive campaign"". The by-election was triggered by the death of Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd, who had held the seat with a majority of nearly 10,000. Labour had been expected to win, but their campaign was thrown into turmoil when remarks from their candidate Mr Ali, widely regarded as antisemitic, were published by the Daily Mail. Mr Ali apologised for his remarks but the party decided to pull their support and ordered their members stop campaigning for him. The Israel-Gaza conflict featured heavily in the by-election, with Mr Galloway telling voters in a campaign leaflet: ""The people of Gaza don't have a vote in this election, you do."" Labour has been divided over how to respond to the war and last year several frontbenchers quit their roles in order to vote for an immediate ceasefire. Veteran political pollster Sir John Curtice told the BBC the Rochdale result would intensify pressure on Sir Keir to toughen up Labour's stance on Israel. However, he doubted there would be much impact on the general election result, because it is ""unlikely that anybody else has the ability to... exploit this issue [the war in Gaza] in the way that Mr Galloway is uniquely able to"". Mr Tully, who got 6,638 votes, is well-known in Rochdale as he runs a garage business and is involved with the town's rugby club. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I feel I've turned the heads of people who don't usually vote because nothing ever really changes with mainstream politics and parties."" Reform UK has performed well in recent by-elections, coming third in both Wellingborough and Kingswood, but their candidate in Rochdale, the town's former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, was beaten into sixth place with 1,968 votes. The Campaign Against Antisemitism said it was ""extremely concerned"" by Mr Galloway's victory, saying he had an  ""atrocious record of baiting the Jewish community"", including calling for Bradford, when he was an MP there, to be declared an ""Israel-free zone"".

"Reading: Anti-war and environmental groups protest outside Barclays bank",NA,2024-02-12,"Two protest groups staged simultaneous demonstrations outside a Barclays bank on Saturday. At the branch in Reading activists from Extinction Rebellion campaigned against the banks investment in fossil fuels. Meanwhile opponents of the war in Gaza highlighted alleged links between Barclays and the arms trade. Barclays previously said it will no longer fund new oil or gas projects. The BBC has contacted the bank for a response. On Friday Barclays announced it stop directly financing energy clients' new oil and gas projects. Laura Barlow, Group Head of Sustainability, said: ""Addressing climate change is a critical and complex challenge. ""We continue to work with our energy clients as they decarbonise and support their efforts to transition in a manner that is just, orderly and addresses energy security. ""Today we strengthen our commitment to the energy transition, with policies that will focus our capital and resources to the energy companies that play a key role in the transition."" In response to this, Adam who was in Reading campaigning with Extinction Rebellion, said: ""We've moved the needle as it were, and we can now continue to put pressure, to get them to tighten up the statements, and improve their strategy. ""But yeah, it feels like a win for activism."" Unconnected protestors in Reading, and at other branches, were highlighting the bank's links with defence companies. Razwan is one of the activists, he said: ""Ask the banks themselves, because of their ethical reporting, they have to report on this, and it's there very clearly, that they're investing in weapons companies. ""Those weapons are killing civilians."" Barclays says it has clear policies on investments in defence, what it will and will not support. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

"Rochdale by-election: Candidates list",NA,2024-02-12,"A by-election prompted by the death of MP Tony Lloyd will be held in Rochdale on 29 February. Sir Tony died on 17 January, days after announcing he had an incurable form of leukaemia. Eleven people have put themselves forward to be the town's next MP. The late MP secured a majority of more than 9,000 in the 2019 general election. The deadline to register to vote in the by-election is midnight on 13 February. A change in the law last year means people who want to vote in person will have to remember to bring a form of photo ID with them. Candidates are listed in alphabetical order by surname. Azhar Ali is the Labour leader on Lancashire County Council and was chosen from a shortlist of three. However, on 12 February Labour said it had ""withdrawn support"" for him after comments he made regarding Israel. It was too late for the party to replace Mr Ali as its candidate. The decision means that Mr Ali will remain on the ballot as the Labour candidate for Rochdale, but if he is elected he will sit as a independent MP or join another party. Mr Ali, from Brierfield in Lancashire, has been a councillor in Nelson East since 2013. He joined Pendle Council aged 24 and served a five-year stint as a government advisor under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. At his campaign launch event, he said: ""In Rochdale there's a lot to do that Tony (Lloyd) started. ""I've set out my five pledges around reopening the maternity unit, investment in the town centre, and free breakfast clubs in the primary schools, and there is a long list of things that we need to do. ""And there's a real opportunity to send Rishi Sunak a clear message that Rochdale supports Labour and they want a general election to remove this government."" Mark Coleman is a long-time climate campaigner and Just Stop Oil supporter who was imprisoned for taking nonviolent direct action. The 64-year-old worked as a vicar in Rochdale town centre until he retired in 2020 due to Parkinson's disease. Mr Coleman said: ""The people of Rochdale deserve the truth - and that is we need radical action on climate right now to stand any chance of a safe and stable future. Government policies have put us well on the way to climate hell, and the Labour Party is willing to let that happen. ""I want the people of Rochdale to be able to 'vote change' in this election to show they want failing Westminster politicians to step up and defend our future."" A former Rochdale MP is standing in the by-election for Reform UK, the party founded by ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Simon Danczuk was elected as the Labour MP in 2010, but was suspended from the party in 2015 over allegations of what he called ""inappropriate behaviour"". He left the Labour Party in 2017 and stood as an independent in that year's general election, receiving 1.8% of the vote. He said: ""The reason I'm standing is because Rochdale's being let down by the main political parties. You've got the Conservatives nationally who are failing to grow the economy, and that impacts adversely on our town. And then secondly they're failing in terms of illegal immigration. It's just out of control and that again impacts on our town. Then locally you've got a lazy Labour Party running the council who are not delivering."" The Lib Dem Parliamentary candidate Iain Donaldson has promised to hold the Conservative government to account for ""failings on the NHS, the cost of living crisis, and water companies polluting the rivers with filthy sewage"". He said: ""The people of Rochdale have been hammered by the double whammy of a cost-of-living crisis and an NHS on its knees. This disastrous Conservative government has utterly failed our area and they need to be held to account. ""Locally, Labour have also taken people for granted because they just don't listen. It is vital that the people of Rochdale are represented with a voice that will take our community's issues right to the heart of Parliament and force ministers to address their concerns."" Paul Ellison, the Conservative candidate in the by-election, was voted Rochdale Man of the Year in 2020 after he helped the borough gain national recognition in the Royal Horticultural Society In Bloom awards. Mr Ellison, who runs a landscaping firm, said: ""In places like Rochdale, people's aspiration can often be stifled by the impacts brought about by negative perceptions. If elected, I am determined to be a champion to the borough. ""I believe there is a great opportunity to show the difference a local candidate with Conservative values of working together, taking pride in your community, and facilitating growth can do, bucking the expectation of a so-called Labour safe seat. ""Labour can't say what they'd do, because they don't have a plan, which means nothing will get better - taking us back to square one."" Former Labour and Respect Party MP George Galloway said he was running to ""teach Labour a lesson"". His Workers Party of Britain says it has a 10-point programme aimed at ""building a new working class politics in Britain"". It ""defends the achievements of the USSR, China, Cuba etc, not least the debt owed by humanity to the Soviet Union and Red Army in their war of liberation against German fascism"". Mr Galloway has contested by-elections in Greater Manchester before. He stood in the Gorton constituency in 2017 and won 5% of the vote. He said the main focus of his campaign will be calling for a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, adding: ""The number of people in Rochdale vitally concerned with the issues that preoccupy me... there's probably not a constituency in the whole country where there are more people concerned about Gaza than there are in Rochdale. ""[No] more people concerned about Kashmir than there are in Rochdale. So, as I have been a spokesman for these causes for more than half a century in both cases, it's obvious that I would be a candidate here."" Updated 10 February 2024 to expand upon the party's priorities Michael Howarth is a ""Rochdale born and bred"" businessman who owns a number of bars in the borough and works and lives in the town. He said he believed previous Rochdale MPs put their party before the town, and said ""smartening up the town centre"" would be one of his priorities. He said: ""Get the empty shops filled and the outlying areas, Millstone Road and the like. We've got to get businesses into town so my agenda would be to make an easier path to open a new business. Whether it be a shop, whether it be a printers, whatever it may be. Let's get businesses open quickly. The more businesses in town, the more jobs. The more jobs, the more prosperity. We can make Rochdale a great place to be."" Independent candidate Billy Howarth is a local campaigner who co-founded the support group Parents Against Grooming UK. He has recently campaigned for better housing for people affected by damp and mould. He raised the £500 candidate registration fee from GoFundMe donations. On the GoFundMe page, he said: ""After 30 years of child abuse cover-ups, two tired leaderships accompanied by failures to protect the town's constituents, I have decided that this town needs to be independently represented. ""I am Rochdale born and bred and have the needs of Rochdale close to my heart. I truly believe I can make the changes that this town wants and deserves."" Guy Otten's name will appear on the ballot paper, but soon after the campaign began the Green Party said he would be stepping down over previously criticising Palestinians and the Islamic religion. A Green Party spokesperson said: ""The Rochdale Green Party candidate has said that he has 'decided to leave the stage' following social media posts made some years ago. As nominations have now closed, his name will still appear on the ballot. However, he will not take part in any campaigning between now and polling day. ""We do not comment on disciplinary matters regarding Green Party members. These are internal matters. However, we are clear, we condemn all forms of racism and discrimination and do not accept it from any Green Party representative or spokesperson."" The candidate for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, Ravin Rodent Subortna, said that as MP he would campaign for the introduction of a 99p coin. He said he would call for all roundabouts to have fairground carousels in the middle to tell cars where to go and prevent road rage. Among his other policies is a plan for all new-build housing to have hedgehog homes included to help eradicate homelessness for hedgehogs, and making sure hedgehogs had lollipop signs to help them cross the road. Ravin says he is aiming to win ""zero votes"" because ""that would be fair to give everybody else a chance"". Local businessman Dave Tully said he was standing in the election to ""be a voice for the people of Rochdale across every community that wants to do good"". He said he was calling for the reinstatement of Rochdale's maternity ward, wanted more financial support for local businesses and would champion the community benefits of local amateur sports clubs including the rugby league club Rochdale Mayfield, where he is a committee member. He added: ""As an independent with no allegiance to any of the parties or any political views or opinions, I just want to do the best for my town and my community. That's basically what I want to achieve. That's what I'm going to advocate."" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

"The battle over political values in the boardroom","By Douglas Fraser",2023-07-27,"The modern chief executive officer has to talk and embody values as much as profits. The modern institutional shareholder and the modern company recruit want to know that they can be comfortable with those values. Dame Alison Rose, NatWest CEO, has now resigned after admitting she had made a mistake in speaking to the BBC about Nigel Farage's relationship with the bank. Yet her departure also brings into focus the potential pitfalls if companies become too picky about customers and whether they align with those values. Dame Alison's predecessors at NatWest, when the whole group was under the Royal Bank of Scotland brand, focused on maximising shareholder value by more conventional means. Fred Goodwin did that in buccaneering and bullying style, trampling over the older canny values of conventional Scottish finance with the goal of creating a global giant. It crashed, hideously, and the British taxpayer had to bail it out. The next two chief executives, Stephen Hester and Ross McEwan, spent much of their time apologising, clearing up the mess and trying to return to vanilla-flavoured banking. They shrank the global bank, with $2.2 trillion in assets, to one focused on the UK, while preparing it for the gradual sale of the Treasury's 82% shareholding. That is now around 42%. One could argue that shareholding was influential in the departure of Dame Alison at 01.45 on Tuesday morning, after Downing Street and the chancellor expressed ""significant concerns"" about her handling of the controversy over Nigel Farage's account with NatWest's private banking division Coutts. But ministers could have weighed in to any other bank in the same position, and without having a shareholding. They are calling in bank executives to warn them against account closures. This is political. And corporate Britain should be on notice that it could be coming to other sectors, boardrooms and executive suites. The issue relates to other news stories around climate change and culture wars. NatWest - or as it then was, Royal Bank of Scotland - was a major financier of fossil fuel extraction around the world. It was heavily involved in developing the North Sea industry. In recent years, however, it came under pressure to pull out of the industry. Campaigners reckon that oil and gas can be squeezed dry by pressuring institutional investors and the banks behind the industry. So when the Cop26 environment summit came to Glasgow, Alison Rose was prominent in the agreement between governments and major financial institutions around the world to dedicate trillions of pounds to financing the great energy transition. She resisted pressure to pull out of oil and gas, conceding only that NatWest would stop funding coal. Her reasoning, when I interviewed her last year, was that NatWest will only finance them if they have a credible plan to reduce emissions and to invest in renewable power. If banks like NatWest aren't doing that, she reasoned, the same companies will get their finance elsewhere, without such conditions. Dame Alison also defended the continued funding of farming, where it too can be linked with global warming. The bank's agriculture relationship managers were being tooled up with advice on how to reduce emissions down on the farm, she said. You can see how conversations like that could influence other thinking within the bank. If oil companies and farmers are at risk of being red-lined as too toxic, because they don't meet NatWest's carbon-reducing targets and values, perhaps it could lead to discussion of other customers. Nigel Farage says he was kicked out of the bank because of his political views. It has led to him calling for the entire board to resign and to questions over the public's rights to an account. Responding to a briefing, reported on BBC news outlets, that indicated he was being pushed out of Coutts because his finances did not meet the criteria to be within its high-income, high-wealth clientele, the former UKIP leader and MEP released a leaked document which said, in highly unflattering terms, that his views were ""not in line with our views or our purpose"". ""Purpose"" has been one of Dame Alison Rose's favourite words, and it has come back to bite her. She has emphasised that NatWest, under her leadership, is not banking for the sake of money but to make a difference and to fulfil a sense of purpose about what it can achieve for customers and for wider society. That thinking was driven through the organisation. Other chief executives talk in similar terms. That bank crash in 2008 hit public trust in business and in business values. It influenced the current generation of leaders with a need to show that corporate values are in sync with customer views and with society. Pressures come from outside lobbying, from regulators, from government, from investors and, importantly, from their own staff to show they are being diverse and inclusive, and working towards shared targets for reduced carbon emissions. Increasingly, auditors, business consultants and lobbyists are having their links to controversial clients challenged through the media. Retailers face pressure to review their supply lines in favour of ethical sourcing. But making those changes risks a backlash. This goes beyond the case for a right to bank. Mr Farage has said that NatWest and Dame Alison's problems were rooted in their move towards inclusion and diversity, and says her exit is only the start of an assault on ""woke"" values in the financial sector. That reflects a strand of conservative opinion that big business has become too liberal. It has become a major issue in US politics. Where once companies were assailed from the consumer movement led by Ralph Nader, they are now under attack from the right, and not on their products but their values. Some legislators are trying to ban business from taking an inclusive stance on gay, trans or abortion rights. In the US, Bud Light was targeted with a boycott over its links to a trans influencer. In Florida, Ron de Santis, the Republican governor and presidential hopeful, has locked horns with the Disney Corporation. These politicians see mileage in the so-called culture wars. Their targets are not just, as they used to be, political opponents at national or more local level, but companies. Chief executives wanting to talk and embody values may find it difficult to answer back. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Climate activists march through Edinburgh in fossil fuels protest",NA,2023-09-16,"Hundreds of climate activists have marched in Edinburgh as part of a global day of action against fossil fuels. The march was organised by groups including Friends of the Earth Scotland, Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace. The route took them past UK government offices to the Scottish Parliament. They are calling on the UK government to cancel its latest tranche of 100 oil and gas exploration licences. Prime Minister Rushi Sunak announced the new licences in in July alongside funding for a carbon capture project in the north east of Scotland. Last week, Friends of the Earth Scotland published an open letter to the first minister, asking that he ""get off the fence"" and oppose plans for the Rosebank oil field. Rosebank is the biggest undeveloped oil field in UK waters containing between 300 and 500 million barrels of oil and lies 80 miles west of Shetland. The UK oil and gas regulator is considering whether or not to allow drilling there. Freya Aitchison, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said she wanted the first minister to oppose attempts to drill there. ""We need the Scottish government to speak up against new oil and gas such as Rosebank and also to say no to a new gas-fired power station in Peterhead, which would prolong demand for gas from the North Sea,"" she said. Other marchers spoke of their concern about the state of the climate after a summer of extreme weather events. Luke Henderson, of the Edinburgh Climate Coalition, said the UK cannot continue to lock itself into decades of relying on fossil fuels. He added: ""You can see it on the news every single day there's a climate related crisis. ""And we are just at the first step of this process. The first step. ""It's going to get worse and worse and worse. We've got to stop it now."" A Scottish government spokesperson said the first minister had made it plain that climate change was a ""key priority"" for his administration. ""Earlier this year we consulted on our draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan, which sets out the importance of the development of Scotland's future energy system for our economy,"" they said. ""We are backing this up with almost £5bn of investment in the net zero energy economy in Scotland over this parliamentary term."" A UK department for energy security and net zero spokesperson said the transition to non-fossil forms of energy could not happen overnight. ""Even when we're net zero, we will still need some oil and gas - the industry also significantly boosts the Scottish economy, estimated to support around 90,000 jobs,"" they said. ""Independent research has shown domestically produced gas is on average four times cleaner than imports."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Constable painting hung in South Tyneside shopping centre","By Kerry Aitken & Angela Johnston",2023-06-23,"An oil painting by one of England's most celebrated artists has been hung in an empty store at a shopping centre. The Cornfield was painted by John Constable in 1826, five years after his The Hay Wain masterpiece, and depicts the Suffolk countryside in summer. Owned by the National Gallery, it is on display at the Viking Shopping Centre in Jarrow as part of the museum's tour. It has attracted a number of art fans, among them James Hays from Gosforth who described it as ""real life"". ""I don't like modern art, I've tried to study it and make something of it and I can't - but this is looking at life, it's real,"" added Mr Hays. The work was painted in January to March in the artist's London studio. The lane winding into the cornfield is based on Fen Lane, where Constable had often walked as a boy from his own village of East Bergholt to Dedham, where he went to school. Although it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1826, it failed to sell. It was presented to the National Gallery in 1837 as a tribute to the artist after his death, by a committee of friends and admirers who eventually bought it. Bernadette and Frank Amos did not have to travel far to see the picture in their local shopping centre, finding it in the vacant Bright House unit. Mrs Amos said: ""I just love the countryside and the feeling it gives you of freedom, I just love the outdoors."" Exhibition manager Gracie Divall from the National Gallery said it was great to see people embracing the opportunity. She said she had met people who had previously seen the painting in London and had taken the chance to see it on their ""doorstep"". Pam Stewart, visiting with her husband Joe from Sunderland, said: ""He's done all of this from memory which is really clever. We all take photographs now and can look back at them but if you ever do paint you never get it quite right - but he's got it and it's fabulous."" David Forbes from North Shields added: ""I saw it was coming on the news and the chance to see something as exquisite as this you can't pass that by. My favourite bit is the little lad drinking water with his head in the pool, it's amazing."" The painting can be viewed in the shopping centre each afternoon until Sunday.

"Food and drink culture compared with smoking in 1960s","By Natalie Grice",2023-08-20,"Does Wales have a problem with unhealthy lifestyles? This summer, two leading politicians have suggested people need to manage their personal behaviour around eating and drinking in order to help the Welsh NHS function. But TV's Dr Chris van Tulleken, who is well-known to a generation of children as one half of the CBBC programme Operation Ouch, likened today's obesity and excess drinking to that of smoking culture in previous decades. Health Minister Eluned Morgan asked people to come on a journey to get fitter, while First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were ""shockingly high"" numbers of drunk people using A&E. But for Dr Chris, an infectious diseases specialist at University College London, the problem is not the people but the social and commercial environment they are surrounded by. His new book, Ultra Processed People, looks at the forces promoting the ultra-processed food. This is food which is very altered from its original state, with additives and ingredients not found in a typical kitchen. They are usually wrapped in plastic and make up most of a typical British diet. Chris said the regulation of alcohol, ultra-processed and gambling apps ""that we know function as addictive products"" was ""so light touch so as to be almost non-existent"". He compared this with the attitude taken towards tobacco 40 or 50 years ago when it was ""an addictive product aggressively marketed 24/7"". ""Saying that people should drink less and eat healthier is a bit like saying to people in the 1960s that they should smoke less,"" he explained. ""It was available everywhere, it was as cheap as dirt and so everyone smoked. No-one looks back at the '60s and wonders 'why didn't everyone just gird their loins and stop smoking?' That would be absurd. ""We all understand we were the victim of predatory marketing practices of an extremely addictive product."" That is now the case with food and alcohol, he argues, and takes an sideways look at drink packaging to prove his point. ""We have on all our [alcoholic] drinks the instruction to drink. It says 'drink aware'. Imagine if on your pack of cigarettes it said 'smoke aware', or 'smoke responsibly'. What does that mean? ""We have no understanding as a society that alcohol - ethanol - is a harmful molecule, that it's carcinogenic, that it's extremely addictive, because alcohol is so normal it's everywhere."" The thing that makes him ""boil with rage"" is the disconnect between politicians working ""hand in glove"" with the drinks industry and allowing ads ""across social media, broadcast media, print media"". When it comes to food, he said people did not suddenly ""collectively lose willpower"" over how much they were eating, but the type of food available - processed, calorie dense, low in fibre and addictive in a way wholefoods are not. There is no question Wales has a problem in this regard. Welsh government figures show 62% of the population is overweight or obese, with the individual statistic for obesity (classed as having a body mass index or BMI of over 30) standing at 25%. But Chris lays much of the blame for this squarely at the door of social inequality and poverty. Obesity among the most deprived social groups is 32% compared with 20% in the least deprived. As an example, the rate among children in Merthyr Tydfil is 17.2% compared with 7.8% in the more affluent Vale of Glamorgan. Wales is also ranked as the poorest of the four nations by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, with 23% living in poverty according to its 2022 report. This provides the perfect breeding ground for harmful health behaviour, he argues. ""One of the ways that the stress and trauma of living with a low income becomes manifest is that people smoke more because people are more vulnerable to advertising for cigarettes. ""People need short-term solutions to the discomfort of their lives. Ultra-processed food is another way of the harms of poverty being manifest,"" he said. He added alcohol products were another way this manifested and were marketed in a ""very aggressive way"" to promote ""fun, happiness and joy"" when it causes ""the very opposite"". He cited the kind of nightlife seen on St Mary Street in Cardiff on a Friday night as ""a great example"" of the kinds of scenes repeated across British towns and cities, where ""emergency services are stretched paper thin by alcohol and drugs"". ""The people to blame appear to be the young people who are using these substances, but really they are the victims of very sophisticated marketing efforts,"" he said. ""We need to think about our cultural understanding of gambling, booze, vape, food, completely transforming."" Martin Blakebrough, chief executive of drug and alcohol charity Kaleidoscope Project, has seen enough drug and alcohol addicts to know those types of problems are multi-layered and people cannot always just try harder to be healthier. ""If you are looking at people who have real problems with alcohol it's clearly linked to deprived situations,"" he said. ""Their diet is poor, [so] the alcohol is more significant."" Another overlooked factor, he argues, is a large section of people with drug and alcohol problems have suffered trauma when young, whereas people who start off in better social positions might get better support and have more ""recovery blocks"", such as income and a job to help anchor them. He added: ""We still push alcohol as a society - we're not banning it, we have a very strong relationship with alcohol."" Matt Lambert, president of the Portman Group, the industry-funded regulatory body for marketing alcohol, said most packaging carried drinking guidelines, pregnancy warnings and signposting to the alcohol education charity Drinkaware. He argued it was ""widely understood"" that excessive drinking was harmful and there had been a decade of falls in binge drinking, underage drinking and drink drinking as well as alcohol-related crime, but recognised there were a ""minority of people"" still misusing alcohol.

"Keir Starmer pledges to end North Sea exploration and let areas profit from clean power","By James Cook",2023-06-19,"Labour will end new North Sea oil and gas exploration, but help communities profit from clean power projects, Sir Keir Starmer has pledged. Speaking in Edinburgh, the Labour leader vowed to ""cut bills, create jobs and provide energy security"". He also said that a previously announced publicly-owned green energy company would be based in Scotland. Sir Keir is under pressure from environmentalists and the oil industry over the scale and pace of change. Climate campaigners have criticised the party for rowing back on a pledge to invest £28bn a year in green industries. In England, planning rules which effectively ban new onshore wind farm developments would be scrapped if Labour won the next election. Labour has confirmed it would ""not grant licences to explore new fields"" in the North Sea, a momentous shift for a sector which supports 200,000 UK jobs, including 90,000 in Scotland, according to trade body Offshore Energies UK. But the party insisted it would honour any licences in existence at the time of the next election, which must be held by January 2025. That is likely to include the controversial new Rosebank development west of Shetland. Sir Keir said: ""Labour will deliver lower bills, good jobs, and energy security for Scotland and the whole UK, as Britain leads the world in the fight against climate change."" He said it would be a ""historic mistake"" to wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out and let the opportunities ""pass us by"". The Labour leader said his party had ""a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs. No cliff edges."" One of Labour's initiatives will be to provide more incentives for areas to take part in new clean energy projects. Under Labour's plans, GB Energy - the new publicly-owned firm which it says will be based in Scotland at a location yet to be decided - would play a key role in getting that message across. It would oversee the return of profits from successful projects to local councils. The councils could then use that income to reduce council tax, pay for improved public services or simply provide rebates on energy bills. Labour says GB Energy could end up providing up to £600m per year to local councils to invest in green infrastructure and a further £400m annually in low interest loans for community projects. These community loans would be designed to ensure small projects could benefit from the expertise of GB Energy while also generating money for local areas. Sir Keir accused the Conservatives and the SNP of having abysmal records on renewables. He said Labour would introduce new rules on ""good work, decent pay and union recognition"" - and create a new incentive. This would be ""a British jobs bonus that will attract new investment, new jobs, new supply chains into our deprived industrial heartlands and will reward companies that back working people"". Offshore Energy UK's chief executive David Whitehouse told the BBC that Labour's plans to move away from the reliance of North Sea oil and gas ""would create a cliff edge"" deterring investment and heightening the risk of energy shortages. Mr Whitehouse said 180 of the North Sea's 283 active oil and gas fields were due to close by 2030, and new licences were ""essential"" or production would ""plummet"" and ""the UK and its skilled workforce will be exposed"". The GMB union said the UK was going to need oil and gas until 2050 and beyond, and that a ban on new licences ""ignores this reality"". But Philip Evans, of Greenpeace UK, said the idea that the plans would ""lead to an overnight shutdown of the industry"" was nonsense. Labour's opposition to new exploration licences represented ""genuine leadership"" he added, and the party was right ""to debunk scare stories being peddled by climate delayers"". Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, welcomed Labour's latest ideas but warned ""there can be no backsliding on pledges to stop new oil and gas extraction and invest in green growth"". Environmental groups are particularly vocal about their opposition to the proposed Rosebank development in the North Atlantic. Industry and government sources say the field could be approved by the UK government's North Sea Transition Authority within weeks. Norwegian state-controlled oil company Equinor said Rosebank could produce almost 70,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak. Sir Keir has held private talks with senior energy industry figures in the past week and previously gave direct assurances to Equinor that a Labour government would not revoke any licences. Instead the party says its focus is on delivering ""cheaper zero carbon power by 2030"" and its ""mission"" includes plans to attract and incentivise investment ""in the UK's industrial heartlands"". That is likely to provoke comparisons with the approach taken by the US Democratic president Joe Biden whose Inflation Reduction Act has been described by the UK Conservative government's Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch as ""protectionist"". The Scottish Conservatives' energy spokesman Liam Kerr described Labour's plans as ""ruinous"" for the UK's oil and gas industry, claiming they ""would throw up to 90,000 highly skilled workers in the North East under a bus pretty much overnight"". The Scottish government said it was committed to ""a planned and fair transition"" away from fossil fuels that did not imperil jobs. First Minister Humza Yousaf said Labour governments had squandered hundreds of billions of pounds of oil and gas revenues, and only invested a fraction in Scotland. ""I am not sure anybody will trust a Labour Party on the green economy just two weeks after they dump their £28bn green prosperity fund,"" he added. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Just Stop Oil eco-zealots writing Labour energy policy - Sunak","By Alice Thompson & Chris Mason",2023-06-07,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said ""eco-zealots"" from Just Stop Oil are ""writing Keir Starmer's energy policy"". Labour has pledged to ban new licences for oil and gas production in the UK. Some unions have warned this risks creating a ""cliff-edge"" for jobs. Dale Vince, a major donor to campaign group Just Stop Oil, has also given Labour more than £1.4m. Labour dismissed the idea Just Stop Oil influence policy, saying Sir Keir has condemned its protests. Mr Vince's green energy firm Ecotricity, has donated more than £1.4m to Labour since 2014, according to filings to the Electoral Commission. He has also donated to the Green Party as well as given money to environmental campaign group Just Stop Oil. There is no suggestion Just Stop Oil have funded Labour directly. But Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands has called for Labour to return donations, arguing it legitimises Just Stop Oil's tactics. Speaking to reporters in Washington DC, where he is due to meet President Biden, Mr Sunak said ""it does appear that these kind of eco-zealots at Just Stop Oil are writing Keir Starmer's energy policy"". The prime minister said: ""Not content with disrupting our summer and cherished sporting events, they are essentially leading us into an energy surrender. ""My view is we should focus on energy security, not weakness and dependency which seems to be the Labour Party's policy. ""They are putting ideology ahead of jobs, ahead of investment, and ahead of our energy security. I think that is wrong. ""It is a completely bizarre policy which says, 'we won't ban oil and gas; we will just ban British oil and gas'. ""The only people that benefit from Keir Starmer's energy policy are dictators and autocrats like Vladimir Putin."" Labour said that Sir Keir had been ""outspoken in his condemnation"" of Just Stop Oil, ""who he believes have put lives and livelihoods at risk"". ""The idea that they have influenced our policy is for the birds,"" a Labour spokesperson said. ""The modern Labour Party doesn't bow to fringe lobbies or extremists.

"Tunisia's El General: The rapper who helped bring down Ben Ali","By Mike Thomson",2023-07-20,"Tunisian rapper El General was just 21 when his haunting, raw video Rais Lebled, or Mr President, went viral in late 2010. Standing in a darkened, sewage strewn alley - festooned in graffiti - he ripped into the country's then dictator, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali - in a way none had dared before. Born Hamada Ben Amor, the fiery young man's explosive song gave voice to the anger, frustration and despair of a whole generation. ""I knew there would be consequences, which scared me due to my young age. I realised the danger of what I had done,"" he tells the BBC at his studio in the coastal city of Sfax. El General was fast becoming famous but with his baseball cap pulled down low of his forehead, few knew his real identity. However, with chanting protestors bellowing his song throughout the country, El General's cover was eventually blown and he was arrested. ""I thought this is the end, you know, because at that time if you went into the Ministry of Interior you wouldn't come out again."" Thankfully and perhaps surprisingly, El General was freed after a few days. By this point his song was not only a revolutionary anthem in Tunisia but had become a rallying cry for pro-democracy protesters across the Middle East, from the streets of Egypt to the souks of Bahrain. El General's face adorned the front page of Time magazine, which listed him among the 100 most influential people in the world. By mid-January 2011, Ben Ali had fled the country. El General and all those who took to the streets in what became known as the Jasmin Revolution had won. Unfortunately, democracy was to prove a big disappointment to many in Tunisia. Although it survived there, unlike in other countries that rose up during the Arab Spring, successive governments did little to improve the lot of most Tunisians. Most politicians came to be viewed as more interested in pointless squabbling and their own self-importance than rescuing a nosediving economy. Democracy was soon seen by many as synonymous with anarchy, political inertia and the collapse of law and order. All of which led to the landslide victory of Kais Saied in the 2019 presidential election. The balding former law professor promised to rescue the country from political and economic chaos. What followed is described by his critics as akin to a coup. After suspending parliament in July 2021, the populist president went on to give himself the powers to rule by decree. Soon after that he scrapped parliament, which has since been replaced by a feebler version, largely stripped of powers to oppose the president. Mr Saied went on to dissolve the High Judicial Council, which guarded the independence of the courts, before sacking more than 50 judges. Last year Mr Saied rewrote the constitution after winning a referendum, which had been boycotted by most opposition groups, amassing even more power for himself. Next came the arrest of dozens of those who have opposed him, from politicians, lawyers and journalists to academics and activists. To El General, the clock appears to be turning right back to the days of fear and repression. ""We are more under control than ever. We don't know if we're living in the present or back in 2010. I'm one of many who feel our country is in danger. We are still in shock. We didn't expect this level of repression."" While Mr Saied has been largely effective in supressing dissent, he has had much less success in keeping prices down. Inflation is pushing many foods beyond the price of even middle-class Tunisians and there are severe shortages of staples like rice, sugar and oil. All of which, one market vendor lamented, is forcing some people to sift through roadside rubbish for food. Nowhere is the rise in poverty more evident than in the struggling suburb of Ettadhamen in the capital, Tunis, where youth unemployment is particularly rife. With drug abuse soaring, a gym owner there, who preferred not to be identified, has begun offering kick-boxing classes. He hopes this will give young people some pride and an interest in something other than narcotics. One young man, sweating heavily from a vigorous work-out, explained that he aimed to get to the top of the sport, so that he could compete in kick-boxing competitions in Europe. The idea being to jump ship as soon as he got there. ""If I get the chance to go abroad and box, the first thing I'll do is think of a way to stay there. I can't lie, if I find a way to do this I won't come back."" Sadly for him, the gym owner later revealed that the sport's authorities have got wise to wise to such schemes. He said they were now taking the passports of Tunisians competing overseas and escorting them to and from competitions. Thousands of other desperate Tunisians are joining soaring numbers of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa in trying to reach Europe in small makeshift boats. Sadly many don't make it. Since 2014 nearly 28,000 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean illegally. Many do survive the extremely dangerous journey. So far this year more than 60,000 migrants have arrived in Italy, double the number for the same period in 2022. As the numbers grow, so does the EU's determination to stop them coming. This is proving quite an earner for the Tunisian leader. Despite saying earlier this year that he was not willing to act as Europe's border guard, earlier this week Mr Saied accepted about $118m (£90m) from the European Union (EU) to help combat Tunisia's people-trafficking trade. A further $1bn is being offered by the EU for investment in Tunisia. This, though, is dependent on Mr Saied agreeing to the terms of a $2bn bail-out package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). So far he has refused to do that. The IMF deal requires him to cut costly subsidies and slim down the bloated government workforce, which Mr Saied knows will be highly unpopular and could even lead to another uprising, this time against him. For the time being at least Mr Saied remains surprisingly popular, though there are growing numbers of people who are deeply worried about the direction he is taking the country. From incendiary speeches about migrants and the jailing of his political opponents, to his deliberate enfeebling of parliament and the judiciary. One such person is El General, though times have changed. Since the huge success of his uprising anthem, he has got married and settled down to raise his family. The former firebrand now lives in a large imposing house in one of Sfax's upmarket suburbs. Having watched his country fall victim to growing repression all over again, El General says he felt compelled to return to song-writing. His insists the lyrics of his latest release include criticism of Mr Saied, though this time it is certainly no revolution rap. It seems El General is content to leave this fight to a new generation of rappers, who perhaps have a little less to lose. ""El General will always be El General, but maybe there is someone who would now be more revolutionary than me. Like in football, for example, we say Lionel Messi is the best of the best, and maybe in a few years there will be someone playing football better than him.""

"Bibby Stockholm: Migrant barge faces legal challenge over fire safety","By Christy Cooney",2023-08-28,"Government plans to accommodate asylum seekers on a barge on England's south coast face a possible legal challenge over fire safety. Lawyers for the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) have written to Home Secretary Suella Braverman raising issues including overcrowding and fire exit access on board the Bibby Stockholm. The government has been given until Thursday to respond. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: ""I am confident the barge is safe."" The Bibby Stockholm is a three-storey barge, currently berthed in Portland Port, Dorset, which is intended to hold around 500 men while they await the outcome of their asylum applications. The first people were moved on to it at the start of this month, although they were later removed when the Legionella bacteria, which can cause serious illness, was detected. Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the FBU, said the union had moved towards a legal challenge after spending weeks trying to raise concerns with the government. The union previously described the vessel as a ""potential death trap"". In their letter to the Home Office, lawyers for the FBU cited media reports which said the Bibby Stockholm had only 222 single-occupancy rooms, but that additional beds had been placed in each in order to to increase the capacity to 506. Other reports said that, while the barge had three fire exits, one was not operational because it was at the end of a gangway that had been deemed too steep to be safely used. A whistleblower in the local authority is also quoted as telling the Times that fire checks in July had led to serious safety concerns and describing the barge as having the potential to become a ""floating Grenfell"". The FBU previously asked to meet Ms Braverman to discuss its concerns, but the request was turned down. ""I'm confident that the barge is safe,"" she told BBC One's Breakfast programme, when asked about the FBU's concerns. ""This barge has accommodated people in the past - asylum seekers, oil rig workers - and barges of this kind have been used to accommodate asylum seekers, for example in Scotland."" The Scottish government said that Ms Braverman's statement was not correct. ""No vessels have been used to accommodate people seeking asylum in Scotland,"" a spokesman said. ""We have made clear to the Home Office that vessels are not suitable accommodation for people seeking asylum."" The spokesman said that the Scottish government had temporarily housed Ukrainian refugees on cruise ships. ""Housing asylum seekers in barges cannot and should not be compared,"" the spokesman said. ""There are fundamental differences."" Ms Braverman accused the FBU of ""carrying out a political attack"" on the government. ""They want to stop us, just like we're dealing with the range of forces who want to stop us from stopping the boats... they're all gleeful about the prospect of us not putting people on the barge."" She said the government had followed all the protocols from the fire authority, Dorset Council, the police and the Health and Safety Executive. Ms Braverman was unable to say on BBC Radio 4's Today programme when people would go back on to the Bibby Stockholm - but it would be ""as soon as we have completed all of the relevant checks"". She said she was ""frustrated"" and ""angry"" by what had happened, adding: ""I take responsibility, the buck stops with me."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority. ""The Bibby Stockholm successfully completed all fire and safety checks ahead of the first individuals boarding. The vessel completed a statutory inspection and refurbishment before undergoing final preparations to accommodate asylum seekers."" The barge has already faced a number of legal challenges, including from refugee charities representing individual migrants and over whether the government has secured the appropriate planning permissions. The latest challenge comes as the Home Office considers plans to fit people arriving illegally in the UK with GPS tags as an alternative to detaining them because of a lack of space in the immigration detention estate, according to the Times.

"Protests: Police powers to stop new tactics come into effect","By Oliver Slow",2023-07-02,"New measures aimed at curbing protest methods often used by environmental groups have come into effect. Police in England and Wales now have powers to move protesters who disrupt transport, while offenders could face three years in jail for tunnelling. The Home Office says the Public Order Act 2023 will target ""a selfish minority"" but critics argue they threaten the right to protest. Groups such as Just Stop Oil have continued with high-profile protests. Under the new laws, those found guilty of tunnelling or ""being present in a tunnel to cause serious disruption"" could be jailed for up to three years. Taking equipment to a tunnel carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison, as will obstructing major transport works. The digging of makeshift tunnels has been used for many years as a form of protest, against projects such as the building of the HS2 rail project, as well as by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil. The British Transport Police and the Ministry of Defence Police will now have powers to move static protests, a common tactic of campaign groups. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the heightened measures will target ""selfish protesters"" who cause ""mayhem"" on the streets. In recent months, the government has also introduced new powers to tackle tactics used by protest groups, including slow-walking and ""locking on"". Despite the enhanced measures, environmental groups have continued to take action, including briefly halting Saturday's annual Pride parade in central London in a protest against one of the event's sponsors. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson told the BBC the ""draconian"" measures were targeting young people who ""just want a liveable future"". Extinction Rebellion urged the government to stop curtailing the right to protest and instead ""stop issuing new licences for oil, coal and gas"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

"London man sentenced over Epsom Derby track protest","By Christian Fuller & PA Media",2023-07-06,"An animal rights activist has been given a suspended prison sentence after running on to the racecourse at the Epsom Derby. Ben Newman, 32, from Hackney, east London, pleaded guilty before Guildford Crown Court in Surrey. He was one of 31 people arrested on 3 June, including 12 on the racecourse grounds. Newman was sentenced to 18 weeks imprisonment suspended for two years and fined a total of £1,356. The Animal Rising activist was chased by police as the crowd jeered before officers tackled him and pulled him away a minute before the horses passed. Newman was criticised by Judge Mark Ockelton for risking the safety of police and security guards who dragged him to one side. Prosecutor Wendy Cottee described the incident as an ""orchestrated and organised action"" and read a text sent by the Animal Rising group to supporters prior to the race which stated: ""We need as many people as possible to go on to the tracks. ""The more of us there are, the more disruption we can cause."" The protest happened after the Jockey Club, which owns Epsom Downs, was granted an injunction banning the Animal Rising group from intervening in the event. Judge Ockelton said: ""The reality of what he did is that a number of public servants had to deal with him with a crowd of horses running towards them. ""This endangered a huge number of public servants."" On Wednesday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman held a summit at Downing Street with police and sports bodies, including the Lawn Tennis Association, the Premier League and the England and Wales Cricket Board to discuss plans to step up security at summer sporting events. That afternoon, Just Stop Oil protesters threw orange confetti and jigsaw pieces on to court 18 at Wimbledon, stopping play twice. It came after members of the group invaded the pitch at Lord's last week during the second Ashes Test. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

"COP28 ‘moment of truth’ for oil industry, says energy boss","By Esme Stallard",2023-11-23,"The world's oil and gas industry has been warned it faces a ""moment of truth"" at next week's UN climate talks. Dr Fatih Birol, head of energy watchdog the International Energy Agency, was speaking as the IEA published a new report on the future of fossil fuels. He said the sector must choose between contributing to the climate crisis or ""becoming part of the solution"". Last year fossil fuel companies were responsible for just 1% of global investment in renewable energy. The publication of this report just a week before the start of the UN climate summit, also known as COP28, is no coincidence. The IEA will want to put pressure on governments attending the conference to get an agreement on reducing the use of fossil fuels. ""The uncomfortable truth that the industry needs to come to terms with is that successful clean energy transitions require much lower demand for oil and gas, which means scaling back oil and gas operations over time - not expanding them. There is no way around this,"" Dr Birol said. This year's conference is also controversial because a major oil producer is host. In the run up to COP28, the man who will chair the climate talks, Sultan Al Jaber of the United Arab Emirates, has been criticised for prioritising a technology known as carbon capture and storage. Carbon capture stops most of the CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels in power stations from being released into the atmosphere, and either re-uses it or stores it underground. But it is expensive and in its infancy. Some critics say fossil fuel producers hope to use the technology to allow them to continue relying on oil and gas Dr Birol said that meeting the world's climate goals ""means letting go of the illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution"". The report estimates that based on current oil and gas consumption the world would have to capture or remove some 32bn tonnes of carbon in order to stop temperatures rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, seen as a key threshold to limit the effects of climate change. And the amount of electricity needed to power these technologies would be greater than the entire world's electricity demand today. Currently, only 45 million tonnes of carbon is captured worldwide each year. Dr Steve Smith, executive director of Oxford Net Zero and CO2RE at the University of Oxford, told the BBC the report was still calling for investment in the technology but that it must come alongside other measures. ""It goes hand in hand with emissions reductions, trying to do carbon dioxide removal at the same time as not cutting our emissions is like being in a speeding car and trying to push the brake and accelerator at the same time,"" he said. The oil and gas industry is one of the largest investors in carbon capture and storage but came under heavy criticism in the report for not investing sufficiently in renewable energy. The world's entire clean energy investments are estimated at about $1.8tn (£1.44tn), according to the IEA. But fossil fuel producers are responsible for just 1% of that - or $18bn - with the rest coming from governments and other industries. Brendan Curran, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: ""This report from IEA highlights that despite that cacophony of claims from oil and gas producers, the actual levels of investment in the transition to net zero sector are negligible and the industry isn't really doing anywhere near enough. This is during a period when oil and gas companies have been recording record profits."" The fossil fuel industry reported revenues of $5tn in 2022 - a record high. And earlier this year BP and Shell rolled back on previous commitments to cut oil production following record profits. As well as criticising fossil fuel companies the report also warned countries against drilling for oil as a means to provide energy security. Earlier this year UK PM Rishi Sunak granted new North Sea oil and gas licences as part of efforts, he said, to improve the UK's resilience to volatile energy markets. Dr Birol told the BBC that he wouldn't comment on individual countries but that any new fossil fuel projects announced today would face ""not only climate risks but business risks"", because by the time the oil reaches the market in seven or eight years' time global oil consumption will be declining.

"Ukraine dam: Thousands flee floods after dam collapse near Nova Kakhovka","By Alex Binley in London and Paul Adams in Kyiv",2023-06-06,"Thousands of people are being evacuated downstream of a major dam which has collapsed in Russian-held Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 80 towns and villages may be flooded after the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka, which he blamed on Russia. Water is surging down the Dnipro river, and is said to pose a catastrophic flooding risk to the city of Kherson. Russia has denied destroying the dam - which it controls - instead blaming Ukrainian shelling. Neither Ukraine nor Russia's claim has been verified by the BBC. The Kakhovka dam, downstream from the huge Kakhovka reservoir, is crucial to the region. It provides water to farmers and residents, as well as to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is also a vital channel carrying water south to Russian-occupied Crimea. Ukraine's state-owned hydropower plants administrator Ukrhydroenergo warned that the peak of a water spill downstream from the emptying reservoir was expected on Wednesday morning. It said this would be followed by a period of ""stabilisation"", with the water expected to rapidly recede in four to five days. There are concerns about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest - which uses reservoir water for cooling. The situation there is said to be under control and there is ""no immediate nuclear safety risk"" for the plant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Video footage shows a torrent of floodwater gushing through a breach in the dam. Several towns are already flooded, while people in areas further downstream have been forced to flee by bus and train. Abound 40,000 people need to be evacuated, Deputy Prosecutor-General Viktoriya Lytvynova said on Ukrainian television - 17,000 people in Ukraine-controlled territory west of the Dnipro River and 25,000 on the Russian-controlled east. Also speaking on Ukrainian television, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said about 1,000 people had been evacuated so far and 24 settlements had been flooded. He accused Russia of shelling the southern region of Kherson, from where people were being evacuated, and issued a warning about the dangers posed by mines being exposed by the rising water levels. One local resident Andriy, who lives close to the dam - which was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - said he believed Russia wanted to ""drown"" his city. In the Ukraine-controlled city of Kherson, a woman called Lyudmyla - who was loading her belongings including a washing machine onto a trailer that was attached to an old car - said: ""We're afraid of flooding. We're taking our things a little higher up."" She called for Russian forces to be ""kicked out of here... they're shooting at us. They're flooding us or doing something else"". Another resident of the city, Serhiy, said he feared ""everything is going to die here"". ""All the living creatures, and people will be flooded out,"" he said, gesturing at nearby houses and gardens. On the Russian-seized riverbank of Nova Kakhovka, the Moscow-installed mayor Vladimir Leontyev said the city was underwater and 900 people had been evacuated. He said 53 evacuation buses were being sent by the authorities to take people from the city and two other settlements nearby to safety. Water levels had risen to over 11m (36ft) and some residents had been taken to hospital, he added. The small town of Oleshky was also heavily flooded, Kremlin-appointed officials said. The Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank had been completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, it said in a post on its Facebook page. It is not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam in the early hours of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up. This seems plausible, as Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to advance into Russian-held territory, as part of their counter-offensive. For Russia, anxious to defend conquered territory in southern Ukraine, the dam represented an obvious problem. Just as Ukrainian forces attacked road and rail bridges further downstream last autumn in a successful effort to isolate Russian forces in and around Kherson, Russia may have decided to destroy the dam to hold up Ukraine's counter-offensive, which it fears could come from multiple directions. However, a Russian official claims Ukraine carried out the attack on the dam to detract from what they said were the failures of its counter-offensive and to deprive Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russian in 2014 - of fresh water. A major Ukrainian push has long been expected. Kyiv has said it would not give advance warning of its start but a recent increase in military activity is being seen as a fresh sign that the counter-offensive may have begun. On Tuesday evening, President Zelensky said the dam destruction would not stop Ukraine. ""We will still liberate all our land,"" he said in a video address. Earlier in the day, Mr Zelensky held an urgent meeting of the country's security and defence council to discuss the issue. On Monday, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced around the ""epicentre of hostilities"" in Bakhmut, but did not say whether the counter-offensive had begun. Bakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting. It has little strategic value - but is important symbolically both for Kyiv and Moscow. Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of defence, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that phone intercepts suggest Russia wants to target more dams. ""They're actually calling to blow up more dams on the Dnipro river,"" he said. Ukraine has branded the attack on the dam ""ecocide"" and said that 150 tonnes of engine oil has spilled into the Dnipro river. Ukrhydroenergo said a power station linked to the dam had been ""completely destroyed... the hydraulic structure is being washed away"". World leaders have laid the blame for the blast at Russia's door, with some calling it a war crime. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam it would ""demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression"". The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said the destruction of the dam demonstrated once again the brutality of Russia's war in Ukraine, while Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said he was ""shocked by the unprecedented attack"". The Geneva Conventions explicitly ban targeting dams in war due to the danger it poses to civilians. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"COP28: UN climate talks go big on ending fossil fuels","By Georgina Rannard and Esme Stallard",2023-12-02,"Countries and oil companies at the UN climate talks have promised to make major progress in tackling global warming in a large new energy pledge. Around 100 countries promised to treble world renewable energy use by 2030. And 50 oil and gas companies including Saudi giant Aramco pledged to stop adding to planet-warming gases by 2050. That only covers emissions from production, not the burning of fossil fuels and critics said it would not meaningfully tackle climate change. But countries pledging to triple renewable energy at the COP28 summit in Dubai said it would help remove fossil fuels from the world's energy system by 2050 at the latest. Supporters, including the EU and COP28 host country the United Arab Emirates (UAE), want the pledge to be included in the final deal made at COP, meaning all of the nearly 200 countries represented here would sign up. Climate groups cautiously welcomed the promise to ramp up renewables, but said that promises by oil and gas companies were ""greenwashing"". ""I am very sceptical,"" said Prof Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics and author of numerous UN climate change reports. ""The real challenge for the oil and gas sector is to move away from producing oil and gas,"" he said. ""Nothing else really matters in the end."" Fatih Birol from the International Energy Agency told BBC News that the fossil fuel industry should reduce its emissions from production by 2030, 20 years earlier than the date promised. They account for around 15% of global emissions - and that's before you even count the gases given off when their products are used to power vehicles and heat homes. He said it is ""facing a moment of truth now in Dubai... Is it going to be partnering with the rest of the world.. Or is it going to stick to their business plans?"". Addressing the summit on Saturday, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said the new pledge ""adds up to more countries and more companies from more sectors than ever before, all aligning with our North Star of 1.5C"". World leaders agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit global warming to that amount. Burning huge amounts of oil, gas and coal is driving climate change but leaders cannot yet agree on how fast the world should stop using them. Mr Jaber called Saturday's pledge ""a great first step"". ""Whilst many national oil companies have adopted net zero 2050 targets for the first time, I know that they and others, can and need to do more,"" he said. ""We need the entire industry to keep 1.5C within reach and set even stronger ambitions for decarbonisation."" The UAE says the Decarbonisation Charter will speed up climate action as oil and gas companies that account for 40% of the world's emissions promise to become net zero by 2050. Reaching net zero means stopping adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law, however, said that the only way to 'decarbonize' carbon-based oil and gas is to stop producing it ""quickly, completely, and permanently"". ""Anything short of this is just more industry greenwash."" The 50 companies, which also include the UAE's state oil company, also pledge to almost entirely stop releasing the potently planet-heating gas methane during oil and gas production by 2030. On Saturday UN Secretary-General General António Guterres told the talks that the world must ""phase out fossil fuels"" in time to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. ""The rapid acceleration of clean energy is needed, and we've called for the tripling of renewables. But it is only half the solution,"" said Tina Stige, Climate Envoy for the Marshall Islands, which is one of the nation's most vulnerable to climate change. ""The pledge can't greenwash countries that are simultaneously expanding fossil fuel production,"" she adds. The UAE's presidency of the COP28 talks has attracted criticism because the country is one the top 10 oil and gas producers in the world and the summit's president Sultan al-Jaber also heads the giant Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). More world leaders are addressing COP28 which is in its third day. In a speech read on behalf of Pope Francis - who cannot attend due to illness - he said renewable energy was crucial to saving the world as well as ""the elimination of fossil fuels, and education in lifestyles that are less dependant.""

"Met 'underfunded for London's unique demands'","By James W Kelly",2023-12-10,"The Metropolitan Police lacks the funding it needs to meet London's “unique demands”, Sadiq Khan has said. The mayor has written to Home Secretary James Cleverley to call for an increase in the National and International Capital City (NICC) grant. NICC is a mechanism provided to the Met to support the additional costs of policing a capital city – including protests, sporting events and diplomatic protection. The Home Office said the force will receive up to £102.3m more in 2023/24 than the previous year. In his letter, Mr Khan wrote: “The Home Office’s independent expert review in 2015 identified a £159m annual gap in funding (at 2015 prices) and recent estimates from the [Metropolitan Police Service] suggest it could now be £240m.” The mayor highlighted the policing of protests and vigils connected to the Israel-Gaza war since October as a strain on police resources. He said 28,000 shifts have been completed in connection with the events. “These additional costs result in reduced resource available for frontline and neighbourhood teams,” he said. Officer welfare is also taking a hit, the mayor wrote, with 4,000 rest days being cancelled. “Many officers have worked every weekend since 7 October and sickness rates are rising, a trend which is likely to continue,” he added. Mr Khan singled out Just Stop Oil protests as a particular repeated issue for police. Figures released by the Met this week show 657 arrests were made over the last five weeks at the climate protests, at a cost of £3.5m. A Met spokesperson said it also resulted in “10,500 officer shifts being taken away from communities”. “The return of a fully funded NICC would not only benefit our officers but all those who live, work or visit London,” Mr Khan said. Susan Hall, Conservative assembly member at City Hall and party candidate for mayor of London, said it is ""vital"" the force has the resources it needs. ""Sadiq Khan has been given millions by the government to get more boots on the ground,"" she added. ""He failed to hit that target and had to give much of that cash back."" A spokesperson for the Home Office said it was ""giving the police the resources they need to tackle crime"". “The Metropolitan Police will receive up to £3.3bn in 2023/24, an increase of up to £102.3m on the previous year,"" they said. ""This includes £185.3m in recognition of the increased demands the force faces from policing the capital city. “We have also provided an additional £75.3m of in-year funding to support the force in managing the costs associated with the 2023/24 pay award.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

"London Pride: Five Just Stop Oil protesters charged",NA,2023-07-02,"Five Just Stop Oil protesters have been charged over demonstrations which briefly led to London's annual Pride parade being delayed. Images on social media on Saturday showed police removing demonstrators who managed to briefly stop the march. Seven people were arrested by the Metropolitan Police. Five have since been charged and two have been bailed. The five people, aged between 20 and 68, have been charged with Public Order offences. They are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Police said the five charged are Ben Plumpton, 68, of Underbank Ave, Charlestown, Calderdale; Zosia Lewis, 22, of Melbourne Street, Newcastle upon Tyne; Oliver Clegg, 20, of Olney Street, Manchester; Gosse Bootsma, 25, of no fixed address, and Callum Goode, 23, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire. In addition, two males, aged 19 and 22 have been released on bail pending further enquiries, the Met added. This year's Pride procession started at midday at Hyde Park Corner and people peacefully made their way through Westminster's streets before it finished at Whitehall Place.

"The deep rooted problem holding back the UK economy","By Faisal Islam",2023-09-27,"The economic shockwaves of the pandemic, and the Ukraine war appear, finally, to be calming. Inflation has fallen for three months in a row and pay is now almost matching the pace of price rises. Interest rates, which had been rising since late 2021 and making life tough for struggling households and families alike, were finally put on pause earlier this month, with Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey saying there were increasing signs higher rates were beginning to to rein in UK inflation. And even in the toughest of environments - three prime ministers in one year and a worldwide pandemic - the UK economy has shown more resilience than had been expected, managing to avoid a recession. While the economy is not quite free of these three years of relentless rolling crises, the path out of this could now be clearing, if the jobs market and oil prices calm. But when the storm subsides, it will reveal more deep-rooted challenges. The future of the economy and prosperity depends on investment spending. The UK has an underinvestment crisis, and it affects both the private and the public sector. A recent trip to Milton Keynes in the south of England is one of the best places to see all the challenges and opportunities in Britain's faltering record on long-term investment. This 1960s city is where long-term economic growth will happen. The city, the original ""new town"" created to house baby boomer Londoners, is now plugged into the future of high tech, high investment growth. Two hundred shopping trolley sized robots trundle down the leafy cycle paths delivering groceries, parcels and fast food. Hire cars can be summoned to drive themselves to your location. There are no flying cars just yet, but the council and the local hospital are trialling delivery of medicines via drone. It might sound like an episode of the Jetsons, the futuristic 1960s American cartoon, yet some parts of the city feel dated. Locals bristle at the city being called a ""concrete jungle"". There is a lot of greenery as well as 1960s and 70s concrete. But some of what was new and gleaming back then, now needs the funding to be renewed and rebuilt, half a century on, both in this city, and across the country. ABB a Swedish-Swiss manufacturing company are training advanced industrial robots here to work with people, on picking, packing, sorting, welding. Its managing director, Dermot Lynch, says investment has been poor. When it comes to deployment of robot technologies, the latest figures show the UK is at the bottom of the G7 advanced economies which include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. Mr Lynch says the key is to get these technologies, already widely used in car factories, into small and medium sized businesses (SMEs). ""The robots code themselves by recording the actions of a human operator. We see that being particularly important in SMEs where there may not be a lot of technical skill."" British business does not now invest as much as other major economies either. The UK was in second place in the G7 for private investment, as a share of the economy in the mid 1990s, but has now fallen behind them all. The long-term impact of this is low productivity - we take more time to produce less than our rivals -which results in low growth, low real wages, and then problems raising money for public services. There is a hope that robotics and artificial intelligence could be the technologies that solve the productivity puzzle. For Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, correcting poor business investment is the main aim of next month's Autumn Statement. Various tax changes have been tried, including the ""superdeduction"" tax break, which gave businesses investing in certain types of equipment, like machinery, a much higher tax reduction than usual. This spring, Mr Hunt announced a new scheme to allow every pound invested by businesses in IT equipment, plants or machinery to be deducted in full from taxable profits. The ""full capital expensing"" policy allows companies for three years to deduct spending on investment from profits, meaning they have to pay lower amounts of corporation tax. But the productivity problem remains stubborn. The other aim of the chancellor with his Autumn Statement is his pledge to balance the borrowing numbers. This is putting pressure on public spending reflected in the recent discussion over the future of the HS2 rail link due to the soaring cost of the project. Capital investment in transport is due to go up sharply, because of HS2, even as it has hardly gone up for schools. A Milton Keynes secondary school head showed me what she called one of the worst examples of the schools concrete crisis: a sports hall, built in the early 1990s, with a bowing RAAC concrete roof. This has sparked criticism of a ""declining public realm"", and whether the fabric of public services in general are up to scratch. Public investment has been low in recent years, and was cut after the financial crisis as part of the coalition's austerity drive. Ahead of the last general election, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a push to increase this to 3% of the size of the national economy - the long term average. But the plans now are to cut that back after next year with a cash freeze brought in to help calm markets after last year's mini budget which sparked turmoil on financial markets. Net public investment will fall from 2.9% of our national income to 2.1% over the next four years. Lower investment also puts the UK's pledge to meet net zero and stop adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2050 in jeopardy. This city is benefiting from a new £760m East West rail link connecting it to Oxford. The plan is to spend billions more on a further connection to Cambridge. This would be a huge boost to growth, connecting two world-beating research centres directly to a city with the space and housing to grow. But with capital spending squeezed, all major transport projects are now being carefully scrutinised. The government's plan appears to be to get the private sector to do the heavy lifting of investing in our economic future. There are exciting opportunities for this in Milton Keynes and beyond that could help crack our poor productivity record. Turning this round is essential for long term growth. But doing so while public investment is being squeezed, is quite the challenge. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"US $6bn deal with Iran under scrutiny in wake of Hamas attack on Israel","By Jude Sheerin & Barbara Plett Usher",2023-10-12,"The US says Iran has not accessed money agreed in a prisoner swap as the White House faces renewed criticism over the deal amid claims Tehran instigated a Hamas attack on Israel last weekend. Washington has a ""quiet understanding"" with go-between Qatar not to free up any of $6bn (£.4.9bn) from the pact, the BBC's US partner CBS reports. Iran's mission to the UN said the US cannot renege on the agreement. The US has said it has no evidence of a direct Iran link to the Hamas assault. The $6bn of Iranian oil funds held in South Korea were unfrozen in September as part of a deal that saw five US-Iranian citizens freed from captivity. US President Joe Biden's officials have pushed back strongly against Republican criticism that the fund empowered Iran's support for Hamas. On Thursday morning, Deputy US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House of Representatives Democrats behind closed doors that the money ""isn't going anywhere anytime soon"". But later in the day, White House spokesman John Kirby would not confirm reports that the funds had been frozen. ""What I can tell you,"" he said, ""is none of it has been accessed and we are watching every dime as you would expect. ""We were watching it very, very closely."" Neither would US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirm the money had been frozen as he visited Tel Aviv on Thursday. He instead listed the ""facts"" about the account in a weary voice when asked about the matter by journalists. America's top diplomat said it was Iran's money from oil sales, that it was held in Qatar and that it was only for food and medicine and that the US has to approve every transaction. It is a complicated mechanism that has not yet been activated. Any such freeze would be a provocative one at a time when the US is trying to prevent Iran and the militant groups it backs from joining the Israel-Hamas conflict. Analysts warn such a move could embolden hardliners in Iran. US officials would also probably be concerned a freeze of the fund would lead Iran to arrest more US-Iranian citizens. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday that Iran had played a role in the attack by funding the military wing of Hamas over the years. But US officials have also said they cannot corroborate reports of direct involvement in the attack by Iran, which is Israel's arch-enemy. President Biden has been under pressure from within his party to stop the funds going to Iran. Democratic senators who are facing re-election next year have joined Republican calls for the US president to effectively break the deal. But Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a statement reported by the Washington Post: ""The senators in question and the US government are all acutely aware that they can NOT renege on the agreement. ""The money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran, earmarked for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to facilitate the acquisition of all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians.""

"Bibby Stockholm: Migrants return to barge amid protest at port gates","By Sophie Cridland & Stephen Stafford & Emily Ford",2023-10-19,"Migrants are returning to an accommodation barge amid protests at the port gates. A coach carrying the migrants arrived at the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, shortly before 13:00 BST. The vessel, which has capacity for up to 500 men awaiting the outcome of asylum applications, was evacuated in August after Legionella bacteria was found in the water supply. The Home Office said it was now ""safe and secure"". The government has said ""using vessels as alternative accommodation, like our European neighbours are already doing, will be better value for British taxpayers and more manageable for communities than costly hotels"". About 30 protesters gathered at the port gates holding banners saying: ""Scrap the prison barge! Refugees welcome."" Just Stop Oil activists managed to stop the coach carrying the asylum seekers in what they called a ""positive protest"" in support of the campaign against the use of the barge. Dorset Police said two people were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage to the coach when it was stopped in Portland Beach Road, while a third person was held on suspicion of criminal damage to a police vehicle. Candy Udwin, of Stand Up To Racism Dorset, said she had been in contact with some of those who had been staying on the Bibby Stockholm. She said: ""They hate it, they say it feels like a prison, some hate being on the sea, they find it very difficult to leave and they are completely separated from the community."" Less than a week after the men first went on the facility, all 39 were disembarked as a precaution when traces of Legionella bacteria, which can cause Legionnaires disease - a type of pneumonia, were found. They were then moved to a hotel. A letter, seen by the BBC, was sent to asylum seekers confirming their re-embarkation and reiterated all asylum accommodation continued to be offered on a ""no-choice basis"". An asylum seeker, who asked to remain anonymous, spoke to the BBC ahead of his return to the vessel. He said it had been a ""difficult"" process as he has not seen his family for nine months, but being in a hotel he had felt ""free"". ""It feels scary,"" he said, adding: ""[The barge] will be crowded. If there's a single virus, then you know everyone will be affected. I think it will be very bad for all of us."" He added: ""I lived there for five days and have experience on the barge, and that's why I am not happy to go back. ""In the hotel we are free to come and go at any time, we are free and [on the barge] we are bound to something - it's like a prison. It is difficult for all of us and many have said they don't want to go back."" The move comes after local councillor Carralyn Parkes lost a High Court fight with Home Secretary Suella Braverman over the lawfulness of housing asylum seekers on the ship. Mr Justice Holgate ruled in the government's favour, saying Mrs Parkes did not have an arguable case. She has since issued a further judicial review claim in the High Court challenging the ongoing decision by Dorset Council that it has no planning jurisdiction over the Bibby Stockholm in Portland Harbour. By Dan Johnson West & south-west of England correspondent The Bibby Stockholm was intended to show there's no luxury in the UK's asylum process, that Britain isn't the soft touch some think. But instead the accommodation barge - repeatedly delayed and beset by problems - became a floating illustration of how complicated our migration challenge is. It was announced in April, was late arriving from Italy, then delayed for refit and inspections in Cornwall, and finally reached Portland in July. When journalists were shown on board we saw a clean and functional vessel with bedrooms down narrow corridors, typical of the industrial accommodation it previously offered to offshore oil workers. Bunk beds were the obvious sign of the doubled capacity which concerned many opponents of the plan, and fire safety experts. What we couldn't see was the Legionella bacteria lurking in the water system. That meant the government's August ""small boats week"" started with the first 39 asylum seekers stepping aboard, then ended with them evacuated back to hotels, after just five nights - embarrassing given the Home Office's intention to reduce hotel bills. There will be a hope everything has now been double, if not triple, checked to avoid any further delays. But even if the Bibby Stockholm reaches its capacity of 500 men, that's only a tiny fraction of the 175,000 currently backlogged in the asylum system. The barge is expected to draw further protests, having already proved controversial on Portland and beyond. Some people question - with the extra costs of chartering, mooring, transport and security - how a vessel can be cheaper than a hotel. The risk is that conditions on board still look too harsh for those concerned about asylum seekers' rights, but not tough enough for those who want a harder line against immigration and small boat crossings. The solutions to ""stop the small boats"" are difficult and contentious. The Bibby Stockholm was planned to be the first of a fleet of barges moored around the coast. So far, it stands alone. The local authority has not mounted a legal challenge to the barge, stating that it would be costly and have little chance of success. The vessel is part of the government's policy to reduce the costs of placing migrants in hotels. The Home Office said: ""Delivering accommodation sites such as the Bibby Stockholm will be more affordable for taxpayers, helping to reduce the £8m daily cost of hotels as well as being more manageable for local communities. ""We're confident that the project, which will house asylum seekers in safe and secure accommodation, meets the planning requirements."" The 222-room, three-storey barge, chartered by the government for 18 months, arrived at the port in July. It was previously used to accommodate homeless people and asylum seekers in Germany and the Netherlands.

"Woman in £37,000 payout after boss dismissed menopause 'excuses'",NA,2023-09-29,"An office manager has won a £37,000 payout after her boss told her she used the menopause as an ""excuse for everything"". Karen Farquharson, 49, said she was told to ""just get on with it"" after being off work ill due to her symptoms. An employment tribunal heard that Jim Clark, managing director of Thistle Marine, in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, dismissed it as ""aches and pains"". Ms Farquharson was off with stress then resigned from the engineering firm. She successfully sued the company for unfair dismissal and harassment. Ms Farquharson had worked for Thistle Marine since 1995 and was earning £38,000 a year before she quit. She described her 72-year-old boss as a ""dinosaur"" who didn't understand changes in the modern workplace. Ms Farquharson said: ""I had known this company for 27 years and they treated me like rubbish. ""Mr Clark, didn't like change. He didn't like being challenged on things. ""He didn't move with the times. I tried to explain some issues in what you can say and what you can't say and it just fell on deaf ears."" Thistle Marine - which provides services to the oil and fishing industries - was founded by Mr Clark in the late 1970s. The tribunal in Aberdeen heard that Mr Clark accused Ms Farquharson of ""strolling in"" when it suited her and had a ""pet hate"" of people not turning up. ""Mr Jim Clark was blunt by nature. He would speak his mind. Mr Clark would often refer to employees who were off sick as 'snowflakes',"" it heard. In August 2021, Ms Farquharson told her employers that she had the menopause and was experiencing a number of ""serious symptoms"". The company paid for her to have a private assessment of her condition. As well as bleeding she was suffering from anxiety, a loss of concentration and brain fog. In December 2022, Ms Farquharson worked from home for two days, at first because of heavy snow and then because she was unwell due to ""heavy menopausal bleeding"". The next day she went in, arriving at 14:00 and passed Mr Clark in the corridor. The hearing was told that he spoke to her in a sarcastic tone, saying ""Oh, I see you've made it in"". She mentioned the snow and also her heavy menopausal bleeding. The tribunal heard that Mr Clark gave her a ""disgusted look"" and then walked away. Ms Farquharson was upset and angry at the implication that she did not have good reason to have not been at work. She later confronted him about the issues. The tribunal heard that he dismissed her menopause symptoms saying everybody has ""aches and pains"". Ms Farquharson - a mother of two girls aged 19 and 21 - said she was ""shocked"" by his outburst. She then wrote to the company launching a grievance about the ""disdain and disgust"" that she had faced. Several days later she discovered her remote access to the company accounts system had been cut off meaning she could no longer work from home. She resigned and took Thistle Marine to the tribunal. At the hearing Mr Clark dismissed his remarks as ""innocent"" and suggested Ms Farquharson had engineered her resignation to get money ahead of her marriage. Thistle Marine's lawyers said her evidence could not be relied upon and suggested it was ""contradictory and unsatisfactory"". They disagreed with the words Ms Farquharson attributed to Mr Clark and said he had no intention to harass her. But, upholding her claims, the panel chaired by judge James Hendry said: ""Jim Clark can best be described a blunt, self-made man and successful businessman. ""He no doubt has many admirable qualities but empathy for others is not among them. ""It became clear to us that he has little time or respect for those, unlike himself, who are not able to work as hard or without illness as he has."" His remarks to Ms Farquharson violated her dignity, the panel concluded. Ms Farquharson, who now works in accounts at another firm, said her treatment and the tribunal was a ""huge strain"". She said: ""The stress was unbelievable and I know that I have gone through it and I have won, but I have still got this anxiety and disbelief at what they did. ""I have lost my self belief, I've got zero confidence now and I am very untrusting. It was the worst experience of my life."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Just Stop Oil march brings Bristol traffic to standstill","By Clara Bullock & Martin Jones",2023-09-23,"A protest march by the group Just Stop Oil brought traffic to a standstill in the centre of Bristol on Saturday afternoon. An estimated 50 people took part in the march. The group said it was protesting against the government's decision to issue new oil and gas licences. ""Unfortunately, we have to engage in disruption because it's the only way we can get any kind of media coverage,"" said Jayne Wade, from Just Stop Oil. ""The point of our whole campaign is to draw attention to the issue, which is that the government issued new oil and gas licences this summer,"" she added. ""We are in an emergency: we just had the hottest summer ever recorded. We're running out of time to act on this."" Drivers who were stuck in traffic said the protest was ""really annoying"". ""It's one of two days of the year I'm driving a car,"" one driver added to BBC Points West. ""They're stopping people from getting on with their lives,"" said another driver. Ms Wade said: ""It's really uncomfortable for us, disrupting the public. ""But if we had a government taking responsibility, then this wouldn't be something we'd have to do.""

"Barry housebuilders face legal threat over green spaces","By Colette Hume",2023-08-11,"Three major housebuilders may face legal action over claims they failed to provide parks and green spaces. Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes are selling houses with little progress on elements such as play areas, Vale of Glamorgan council said. The authority may seek an injunction which could stop buyers moving into the Barry Waterfront development until amenities are built. But the firms said they were committed to delivering ""as quickly as possible"". Persimmon Homes, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes make up the Waterfront Consortium and are behind plans for 2,000 new homes, as well as retail units, offices and a new primary school around the old Barry Dock. However, a proposed park is currently a mound of earth surrounded by wooden pallets and skips. Natalie Tanner was one of the first people to move into the development, and said she was promised sculptured gardens, which are yet to materialise. ""I feel disappointed because I do feel that it's really become quite slow. ""I know obviously they're rushing the houses but you don't see any movement on the green spaces."" Council leader Lis Burnett said, despite holding a series of meetings with the consortium, there had been little progress on the benefits for the community. The council is considering seeking a High Court injunction which could prevent any new residents occupying their homes before the extra amenities are provided. ""There has been a catalogue of broken promises and weak excuses for the lack of progress, yet remarkably, these issues do not seem to be affecting the developers' housebuilding programme,"" said Ms Burnett. She concluded that the companies were ""interested in profit not people"" and insisted the council would ""do everything in our power to hold developers to account"". As part of the planning permission granted by the council, the developers are supposed to provide a series of amenities to mitigate the impact of a new development, known as Section 106 agreements. These can include new schools, shops, parks and green spaces. In response, the consortium confirmed it met the council in June to discuss the issues and ""reassure them of our commitment to deliver these facilities as quickly as possible"". It added: ""We have since devised and commenced a detailed programme of works, which has been shared in full with the Vale of Glamorgan council. ""We will continue to work with the Vale council to complete these areas and the Barry Waterfront regeneration project to the highest standard."" The Welsh government said it was ""important that developments promised are delivered"" and that it would expect ""companies to follow contractual obligations when working on spaces for people to live and enjoy"". Vale of Glamorgan is not the only local authority considering legal action against developers. Harlow council in Essex said it was seeking a High Court injunction against Persimmon, Barratt David Wilson and Taylor Wimpey over a lack of community facilities, including sports pitches, allotments, a community centre and retail units at Gilden Park. It aims to stop anyone moving into the development until the works are complete. The developers apologised for the delay in Harlow and said they were ""fully committed"" to completing the work.

"Lise Davidsen on singing at the Last Night Of The Proms, one year late","By Mark Savage",2023-09-08,"When Lise Davidsen takes centre stage at the Last Night of the Proms on Saturday, it will be the fulfilment of a long-standing commitment. The world's most in-demand soprano, she was originally due to play the concert last year, only for it to be called off when Queen Elizabeth II died. She was ""deep into rehearsing Rule, Britannia"" with the BBC Symphony Orchestra when the news came. ""You couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed,"" she says. Calling off the concert was the ""right decision"", she adds. ""It felt, for me, like a memory of the first part of Covid. You totally understand why it's happening but, on the other hand, everyone felt this sort of empty space, because were all super excited and very focused"". Despite her hectic concert schedule, which is planned four to five years into the future, the Norwegian singer was able to accommodate a return to the Proms this year, where she will perform alongside star cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason. For many, this will be their first chance to see Davidsen, whose voice was once described by the New York Times as so ""arrestingly powerful and visceral"" that ""you feel it as almost physical presence - pressing against your chest, raising the hairs on the back of your neck."" Likewise, she has never experienced the vaudevillian atmosphere of the Last Night, with all its flamboyant costumes and communal singalongs. ""We don't have anything similar in Norway,"" says the singer, who prepared for her debut by watching old clips on YouTube. ""I look forward to seeing the flags, I look forward to seeing people dressed up in whatever they want to wear and experiencing this shared joy when we sing together."" ""It's the closest I get to being in a sports event!"" Traditionally, the soloists at the Last Night get involved in the circus-like atmosphere, In 2021, Australian tenor Stuart Skelton performed Rule, Britannia! in a full Aussie cricket outfit; while Sweden's Nina Stemme dressed as a Valkyrie in 2017. Davidsen, a cool, calm presence who stands at nearly six foot two, is opting for something more demure. ""I'm not going completely Norwegian, either as a troll or a Viking!"" she laughs. ""I will stay with what I love the most. And that's a good, nice dress."" She might be one of opera's biggest new stars, but Davidsen had an unusual route to the international stage. She was born in Stokke, Norway - a city with a population of just over 11,000 - and didn't see her first opera until she was 20 years old. Classical music was barely a presence in her house. Her mother, who worked in a care home, and father, an electrician, were more into sports. But on the way to handball matches, the car stereo would play Eva Cassidy and Joni Mitchell, inspiring Davidsen to learn guitar in her teens. At Christmas, she would perform with the church choir; and eventually a school teacher advised her to study singing as a soloist. That led her to the Grieg Academy in Norway, where she achieved a bachelor's degree in classical singing. And it was there that she saw her first opera, Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. Enamoured by the production, she nonetheless discounted the idea of taking up opera herself (""it seemed as impossible, as if I would speak Chinese tomorrow,"" she once said). Then, during a master's degree in Copenhagen, a teacher said she had the potential to be an operatic soprano. It was a change that required her to ditch her previous mezzo-soprano repertoire and learn an entirely new vocal technique; but the rewards were almost immediate. In 2015, she was catapulted onto the international stage after winning back-to-back prizes at the Queen Sonja and Operalia competitions, and the world came calling: Glyndebourne, the Royal Opera House, Bayreuth, the Berlin Opera, the Met, the Proms. Does she think her late arrival to opera helped her stand out? ""Yes and no,"" she says carefully. ""I always think that my colleagues, who've been brought up with classical music, have a bigger view on what's been recorded and what's been done - and so therefore you might make your choices differently. ""But I think maybe it's helped my approach, in terms of singing - because I have been singing based on the fact that I really enjoyed it and I wanted to get better, and I haven't had my mum hovering over me saying, 'you should practise, you should practise'."" When Covid struck in 2020, she was singing Leonore in Fidelio at the Royal Opera House. Davidsen caught the virus during dress rehearsals, before anyone really knew what it was. At first she thought her sudden lack of energy was fatigue, and she was somewhat relieved when the diagnosis came through. But a second brush with the disease last winter posed a serious threat to her career. ""I lost my voice completely for three weeks,"" she says. ""I could talk, I could do day-to-day things, but I couldn't sing, I couldn't go for a run, I couldn't do those extra things. ""It sort of put my muscles out of work. They wouldn't do what I told them to do."" It took an intensive process of vocal exercises to build her strength back up, but she persevered just in time to deliver her first major Verdi role, as Don Carlo's Elizabeth de Valois, at the Royal Opera House. Reviews for the production were mixed, but Davidsen's performance was universally praised. ""Hers is the voice of a lifetime, still developing, still exploring,"" wrote The Observer's Fiona Maddocks. Not only that, but Davidsen ""has developed into a moving actress"", said Gramophone's Francis Muzzu. ""Her performance will go down in the history books."" All the accolades, however, passed her by. ""I don't really read the reviews,"" she says. ""And it's not to say that I don't care, because I think it's really important. But I have a very clear view of what I need to do from one show to the next and that's my focus. ""When I retire, I will read the reviews."" Retirement is a long way off. After the Proms, Davidsen heads straight to the Met in New York for a solo recital, while next year will see her playing Giorgetta in Puccini's Il Tabarro, and Leonora in Verdi's La Forza del Destino, amongst other roles. Before that, however, she's going back to her roots with an album of traditional Christmas music - O Holy Night, The First Noël, Silent Night. Christmas remains her favourite time of year. A period when she can escape the demands of touring and international performance, and surround herself with home comforts. ""In Norway, we celebrate on the 24th of December. We'll wake up late, watch some telly, very relaxed... Or rather, I'm relaxed because I have no responsibility for the food! ""And then often we go to church and there's a nativity play where all the kids in the local area attend and they sing, and that is maybe my favourite part."" Famously, of course, the country is swathed in darkness for most of December - and Davidsen says that makes the festive season seem even more special. ""There's just a couple of hours of light during the day and then we're surrounded by a lot of lights, a lot of candles. It's quite magical."" And has she converted her family to the wonders of opera yet? ""Oh yes! My parents, my sisters are converted - and I'm getting deep into converting my nephews as well. ""They're more into Manchester United and rap, but my youngest nephew is coming to the Last Night of the Proms, so it's never too late."" How will you be watching the Last Night Of The Proms?

"Will Titan's loss end dives to Titanic wreck forever?","By Juan Benn Jr.",2023-06-29,"Ever since RMS Titanic set sail across the Atlantic Ocean on 10 April 1912, people around the world have been fascinated by the ship and its terrible tragedy. Its history has inspired a blockbuster film and a thriving tourist industry in Canada, the US, and the UK, including Southampton, England where it set sail, and St John's in Newfoundland and Labrador, the city nearest to where it sank. The industry draws millions of visitors to museums and memorials worldwide, and an elite few have bought an even closer look, by making the 3.8km descent to the Titanic wreck site itself, some paying up to $250,000 (£197,700) for the privilege. Now the deaths of the five people aboard OceanGate's Titan submersible, which authorities said imploded after a catastrophic failure, have amplified long-standing moral and safety concerns about the Titanic exploration industry, and could put a damper on future trips to the wreckage. The descendants of people who were on board the ocean liner have long accused Titanic tourists of turning a tragedy into a spectator sport. ""If people wish to pay their respects to Titanic and the many who lost their lives, that's fine,"" Jean Legg told the BBC. ""[But] my view is that the Titanic should remain in peace… She should be considered as the resting place for all the souls who lost their lives."" Legg's father, Sidney Daniels, was a third-class steward on the Titanic. On the night it sunk into the sea, Daniels survived by jumping into the water and swimming to a lifeboat. He was 18 years old, and was believed to be the last surviving crew member when he died in 1983. Some are also comparing the hubris of the Titanic - which was famously marketed as ""unsinkable"" - with the recent tragedy on board the Titan. After the sub lost contact last week, claims emerged that the company running the trip, OceanGate, had not followed industry normal standards in its design and classification. ""Just as Titanic taught the world safety lessons, so, too, should Titan's loss,"" said Charlie Haas, president of the historical organisation the Titanic International Society. The Titan was far from the first to voyage down to the Titanic. Deep Ocean Expeditions started making trips in 1998, charging passengers $32,500 for a seat. Later, companies such as Bluefish, RMS Titanic Inc, and Blue Marble Private (through a partnership with OceanGate) carried out trips of their own. However, Deep Ocean Expeditions and Bluefish have not made the dive since 2012, and it has been over a decade since RMS Titanic Inc made its last voyage. Because submersibles operate in international waters, there is no one regulatory body overseeing ship and safety standards. But many companies voluntarily choose to get their ships certified by one of several organisations. According to Will Kohnen, chairman of The Marine Technology Society submarine committee, there are only 10 marine vessels capable of reaching Titanic level depths. ""All of them are certified except the Titan,"" he told Reuters. No company had plunged into Titanic exploration quite like OceanGate, the company behind the Titan. Co-founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush, who died aboard the sub, the company had 18 dives planned this year alone, according to its website. Rush was related to people lost on the Titanic through marriage, and had said the tours were helping research efforts by documenting the deterioration of the wreck. But he has also been accused of ignoring safety advice in pursuit of technological innovation. A 2018 letter written by the Marine Technological Society, addressed to OceanGate, accused Rush of falsely advertising Titan as a DNV-approved vessel (DNV is a global accreditation organisation based in Norway). The letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, said the company's methods were ""experimental"" and ""could result in negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic) that would have serious consequences for everyone in the industry"". A spokesman for OceanGate could not be reached for comment. In light of the recent disaster, many have called for greater oversight of the submersible industry and caution around any future trips to the Titanic wreckage. Titanic expert Tim Maltin said that tourists should pause diving to the wreck until more is uncovered about what happened with the Titan sub. ""We need to make sure that any vessels that go down there carrying fee-paying passengers…[are] certified to greater depths than they will be put through,"" said Maltin. Caroline Heaven, a member of the British Titanic Society, agreed. ""I see no point in even considering the perilous journey to the wreck,"" she told the BBC. ""The dangers involved are too great, the conditions are too cramped, and visibility is limited when the wreck is reached."" But others say history will be lost if trips to the sunken ship stop forever. Lowell Lytle, a 91-year-old author and Captain Smith impersonator, visited the wreckage site in 2000 with RMS Titanic Inc and said the experience was ""amazing"". ""I respect the people that think we should just leave it and not do anything,"" he told the BBC. ""[But] there will be generations that will never see…the items that were on the Titanic."" Globally, interest in deep-sea exploration has spawned a whole industry around submersible and submarine tourism. In Australia, people can walk the ocean floor, wearing helmets and protective suits. A luxury submarine hotel in St Lucia called Lovers Deep takes couples on an underwater journey starting at $150,000 a night - private chef and butler included. Many of the people on board these kinds of trips as described as ""citizen scientists"", collecting images and data for research purposes. But what happened on board the Titan is sure to cast a pall, said Alan Whitefield, the director of Silvercrest Submarines. He said we can expect a ""knee-jerk reaction"" from the public, but he thinks the submersible industry will recover. ""It's like the airline industry,"" Mr Whitefield told the BBC. ""If a plane crashes somewhere, everybody's nervous for the next couple of weeks. But everybody keeps flying after a couple of months, everybody's forgotten about it.""

"Can tech stop India wasting so much of its harvest?","By Priti Gupta",2023-10-02,"Kapil Jain's father didn't want his children to be farmers. ""My father had seen the hardship which farmers go through, so we were all educated and moved to the city to pursue a profession,"" he says. But Mr Jain become tired with life in the city, and in 2018 he moved back to his family farm, near Kota in Rajasthan, north India. ""I realised that I like the touch of earth and wanted to move back to the village and start farming,"" he says. He didn't want to farm the same crops as his father - wheat, rice, mustard and soya beans. Instead, with his part of Rajasthan suffering water shortages, Mr Jain looked for a crop that would use less water. He decided to experiment with roses, which grow well in sunny conditions and need relatively little water, compared with traditional crops. But while the roses grew well, harvesting them and getting them to market proved a challenge. The roses had to be sold just hours after being picked, otherwise the petals begin to fall. To meet peak demand the flowers had to be at the market at 05:00. While the market was only 20 miles away, the journey could take an hour. So the crop had to be picked between 02:00 and 03:00, which made finding workers difficult. As a result of those challenges, Mr Jain lost around 70% of his first few crops. Something had to change. So Mr Jain decided to turn his roses into rose water and rose oil. Also, for his tomato crop he bought a solar-powered drying system. ""So now I dry my products and sell them in market at the same time as the rose water, rose oil and jams. They have a bigger market and shelf life and that will help me grow my business."" Getting harvested produce to market in good condition is a problem that farmers all over India struggle with. According to government figures, in 2022 India lost between 6% and 15% of its fruit, between 5% and 12% of its vegetables, and between 4% and 6% of its cereals. ""Farmers throw away large amounts of fruits and vegetables because of a lack of infrastructure, limited processing capacity... natural disasters like cyclones, and floods that disrupt transportation routes and damage facilities,"" says Varun Raheja, founder of Raheja Solar Food Processing. Mr Raheja points out that most Indian farms are small, without the resources to invest in storage or refrigeration. So Mr Raheja developed a simple air drying system, which uses sunlight and solar-powered fans to dry the produce. It's cheap and easy to assemble. ""The DIY model of our solar dryer makes it portable and affordable, it can reach even the remotest village, and can be afforded by every small and marginal farmer,"" he says. His firm has sold around 3,000 of the systems, which Mr Raheja says, on average, dry about 150kg of produce a month. Mr Raheja also operates as a middle man, buying dried produce and selling them on to larger firms. In contrast to Mr Raheja's low-cost, low-tech solution there is WayCool. The Indian agri-tech firm works with 200,000 farmers, owns 412 distribution centres and has invested in sophisticated systems that forecast demand for agricultural products. Around 2,000 tonnes of fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts, spices, dairy products flow through its network every day. WayCool says that its data analysis combined with modern distribution systems can help rescue some of India's lost produce. ""We employ technology to predict retailer orders, optimise collection centres, and set target prices, making supply chains efficient, and bringing supply chain losses to under 2%,"" says Karthik Jayaraman, managing director at WayCool Foods. WayCool has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build its network, and plans to be profitable by 2025. Despite such high and low-tech innovation, much work still need to be done to reach India's more remote farmers. Sagar Lokhande farms 15 acres in the village of Bhendwad in Maharashtra state. He grows sugar cane because it has a long shelf life. Meanwhile tomatoes, green beans and vegetables are grown as cash crops. In May he had a good crop of tomatoes and beans, but by the time his crops arrived at the market, trucks had arrived from all over Maharashtra and prices had dropped. But without any storage facilities he was forced to sell at a loss. ""I grow green vegetables but cannot send it to cites as we don't have temperature control vans, and all the produce will get spoiled,"" says Mr Lokhande. Now he is investigating freezing his produce. ""I want to start selling frozen vegetables which have a longer shell life, especially beans which give a good price, so I will be able to repay all my loans and at the same time make more money."" More technology of business Marcella D'Souza is the director of the WOTR Centre for Resilience Studies, and has spent decades working with farmers in rural regions of India. ""It [technology] can bring in a lot of efficiency and effectiveness in planning, use of resources, decision making, coordination for several processes related to farming,"" she says. But she says technology alone is not enough for Indian farmers. ""A holistic approach that looks at restoring natural ecosystems along with traditional knowledge, handholding support, credit and other factors are equally important for successful farming.""

"Newspaper headlines: PM's pro-car pledge and 'EU holiday chaos'","By BBC News",2023-07-30,"The Sunday Times reports that Rishi Sunak will announce funding for a multi-million pound carbon capture scheme in Aberdeenshire on Monday. The paper says the project would allow greenhouse gas emissions to be stored under the North Sea while allowing oil and gas production to continue. Energy Secretary Grant Shapps tells the Sun on Sunday that Labour's plans to stop new drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea would lead to ""lights going out"" around the UK. Mr Shapps brands Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's proposals ""insane"". But a spokesman for Labour tells the paper they won't ""take any lessons"" on energy policy from the Conservatives. who they said had left Britain ""at the mercy of tyrants across the world"". The Sunday Mirror accuses the prime minister of ""provoking outrage"" by taking a 200 mile (320km) journey on a Conservative Party donor's helicopter - all while, as the paper puts it, the ""world fries"". It claims the trip from London to North Wales would have taken just 10 minutes longer by train. Downing Street says Mr Sunak's travel plans make the best use of his time. The continued fallout from the closure of Nigel Farage's bank account is covered by a number of papers. The Sunday Telegraph reports that the former UKIP leader has set up a website to find others who've had their accounts shut, as part of what he says is a ""national scandal"". The Sunday Times has been speaking to the self-styled ""bad boys of Brexit"" - Arron Banks, Andrew Wigmore and Richard Tice -  who all say they've had their bank accounts closed in recent years. Grant Shapps also told the Sun on Sunday that his family had been, as he put it, ""de-banked"". The Home Office has ""secretly"" backed the used of facial recognition cameras to help prevent shoplifting, according to the Observer. The paper says officials will now lobby the privacy regulator to allow the roll-out of the devices, which critics claim discriminate based on skin colour and breach basic human rights. A spokesperson for the Home Office said facial recognition technology can protect shops and their staff. The Sunday Times says Home Secretary Suella Braverman is gathering an ""international alliance"" to take on Facebook over its plans to make end-to-end encryption standard on its messaging apps. She claims the proposals could make it easier for criminals to communicate. Facebook's parent company, Meta, says the technology is already used widely - and it has tools to prevent its exploitation. There could be ""holiday chaos"" next year - according to the Mail on Sunday - because of what it calls ""Big Brother"" visas implemented by the EU. It says British travellers could be fingerprinted and photographed under the plans. In its editorial, the paper asks whether Brussels is ""punishing"" the UK for having the ""temerity"" to pursue Brexit. The back pages are dominated by the retirement of Stuart Broad. The Sunday Express urges England to ""Do it for Stu"" in the 5th Ashes Test - while the Sunday Telegraph says the bowler has been one of English cricket's ""great characters"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Niger coup: Fear and anger in Niamey as Ecowas threatens force","By Catherine Byaruhanga",2023-08-11,"Zara Kada serves up dishes of rice, fish and vegetables in plastic bowls to her customers sitting on wooden benches in the capital of Niger's capital, Niamey. This business is a lifeline for the widowed mother-of-seven but it's under threat as food prices have shot up after economic sanctions were imposed after the military seized power. ""Not only has the price of rice increased but also that of cooking oil. It's an increase of 2,500F CFA ($4: £3) in just one week,"" she says standing by her small food stall. ""This causes us problems because if I prepare the rice and I can't sell it, there will be no profits, only losses."" Two weeks ago, Niger's army deposed the country's democratically elected President, Mohamed Bazoum, attracting widespread international condemnation. The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) is determined to stop yet another military takeover in the region - the sixth in just three years. ""We are drawing the line in the sand,"" Ecowas security chief Abdel Fatau Musah tells the BBC. ""There is a contagion and if we do not determinedly stop what has happened there, then which country is next?"" he asks. So Ecowas has reacted quickly, by cutting off financial transactions, electricity supplies and, in a move particularly painful for landlocked Niger, closed its land borders, blocking crucial imports. Now, after a second emergency summit on the crisis in Niger, regional heads of state have ordered the activation of a standby military force, ready to invade the country should the military continue their hold on power. On the streets of Niamey, there is real anger at the way regional governments have reacted and the threat of military intervention. ""The Niger soldiers are ready to face any aggression against our country of any kind. They should count on our support, the support of the population and its partners. We are ready,"" says Bana Ibrahim. The 46-year-old is one of the leaders of a so-called self-defence unit that has been set up in response to the Ecowas announcement. Another member of the unit, Moudi Moussa, agrees: ""We are here to defend our country because the country is threatened by Ecowas mercenaries. I call them mercenaries in the pay of [French President Emmanuel] Macron. So we are here to protect our Niger and the people of Niger."" While businesses like Ms Kada's have taken a hit since the coup, Ibrahim Souleymane's is picking up. In his crammed tailor's shop, he picks out white, blue and red pieces of cloth - the colours of the Russian tricolour. ""It was with the advent of the [General] Tchiani coup that I started sewing flags. Especially for Russia. People come to buy a lot of it because they use it to support our soldiers who have taken power,"" he says. Even though the flags of France, Niger's former colonial ruler, and Russia have the same colours, some people's feelings towards the two European powers couldn't be more different. ""People buy it [Russian flag] because we are in conflict with France. For years, France has only caused us problems and the military wants to put an end to it,"" Mr Souleymane adds. The coup has unleashed widespread anti-French sentiment in the country. Paris is accused of continuing to wield undue influence in Niger long after independence and unfairly benefiting from its natural resources while most people live below the poverty line. Moscow has built close ties with neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso - two other former French colonies which have seen recent military takeovers. Its propaganda networks promote Russia as a better ally for African countries. France has lost public goodwill in many Francophone countries and it's now backing the unpopular intervention by Ecowas in Niger. In a statement, the government in Paris said it ""affirms its full support for all the conclusions"" of this week's summit. On social media networks, regional heads of state are facing accusations of working in the interests of Western powers - Mr Bazoum was a close ally of both the US and France and allowed them to have military bases in the country to help fight Islamist insurgents who are targeting the entire Sahel region of West Africa. But how likely is it that Ecowas will carry out its threat to use force? ""They still say it's on the table, but I think it's up for negation,"" argues Marie-Roger Biloa, a West Africa analyst. ""The military option will prove to be very delicate, and there are many voices against it. Even former prime ministers, former dignitaries of Niger are saying: 'Please, please don't launch a military attack against our country. That will be terrible for the population.'"" However Ms Biloa believes regional leaders will have to find a solution otherwise there could be more coups on the continent, especially where military elites can capitalise on the weaknesses of civilian authorities to seize power. ""African governments are having a hard time trying to deliver on the needs of the people,"" she says. ""You have a huge population, which is very young, jobless, and they are not sure of the future. In this political context, you can always find people who support you when you overthrow the incumbent."" Back at her food stall in Niamey, Ms Kada is worried an Ecowas invasion could open a deadly pandora's box for her country.

"Silverstone festival not just for men says Northamptonshire circuit boss","By Mariam Issimdar",2023-08-25,"The 75th anniversary of the Silverstone Festival shows how the racing event has changed from an event aimed at men to a family affair, the circuit's boss said. The motor sports event in Northamptonshire runs until Sunday. It features races, classic Formula 1 cars, a celebration of stock car racing, and music from chart acts. Silverstone's managing director Stuart Pringle said it was ""not a stuck-in-aspic historic festival - it's a festival that grows year on year"". Previously known as the Silverstone Classic, the event has had a name change. ""The reality is that the content that is on the track is exactly the same as it was - the classic, top-quality historic racing,"" he said. ""But actually, we've put a lot more emphasis on the music element, as we did with Formula 1, and we've got more entertainment for the whole family. ""The days of groups of men going off to watch motor racing is behind us, and actually we've got to appeal to whole family groups."" The event features three days of racing and classic car parades, while the music stages include McFly, ABC, The Christians and Sugababes. Mr Pringle is also responsible for ensuring the British Grand Prix goes off smoothly each year. Speaking about the fact there was no repeat of the 2022 track invasion at this year's British Grand Prix, he said: ""I was very pleased."" Mr Pringle said a large team of people were involved in planning how to prevent and respond to any protest, such as that carried out by Just Stop Oil. He said the festival was less pressure for him than F1 and it was equally enjoyable, adding that the circuit's reputation acted as a magnet for the very best cars. ""I'm a real sucker for pre-war cars, but putting me on the spot, I'd go for the late 50s early 60s cars,"" he said. ""They're have a combination of the beautiful sculpted look, before aero-dynamics really became the driving force."" He said the public would have a chance to get up close to the vehicles and talk to the drivers. ""If you are into your cars this is the place to come,"" he said.

"Keir Starmer speech disrupted as protester glitter-bombs Labour leader","By Joshua Nevett",2023-10-10,"A man has been arrested after a protester gatecrashed Sir Keir Starmer's speech and showered the Labour leader with glitter at the party's conference. The speech was delayed as the protester was dragged off stage by security and the man was put in a police van. The protest was claimed by People Demand Democracy, which uses disruptive tactics to push for electoral reform. Sir Keir dusted off the glitter and said the protest did not bother him. ""Protest or power, that's why we've changed,"" Sir Keir said, before setting out his vision of a country governed by a Labour government. It was a chaotic start to his conference speech, potentially his last before the next general election. But a spokesman later said the Labour leader was ""fine"" and ""completely unfazed by what happened"". ""It shows his strength of character that he got on and delivered the speech of his life,"" the spokesman added. Nevertheless, the protest raises questions about the effectiveness of the security arrangements for Sir Keir, who has close protection as leader of the opposition. Wearing a T-shirt with People Demand Democracy emblazoned on the front, the protester said ""politics needs an update"" in front of a stunned audience in Liverpool. Minutes later, a man was filmed being escorted from the conference centre and put into a police van outside. Merseyside Police said a 28-year-old man from Surrey had been arrested on suspicion of assault, breach of the peace and causing public nuisance following an incident at Labour's conference. ""He has been taken to a police station where he will be questioned by police,"" a spokesperson said. The campaign behind the protest is linked to Just Stop Oil, which is well known for its disruptive demonstrations, such as spraying buildings with orange paint and sprinkling glitter at sporting events. People Demand Democracy says it is a new group calling for ""an upgrade to the UK political system using civil disobedience to get their message across"". The campaign is calling for ""a fair, proportional voting system for Westminster elections and a permanent, legally-binding national House of Citizens, selected by democratic lottery"". In a statement prepared before Sir Keir's speech, the protester backed the campaign's calls for democratic reform and said Labour had been ""captured"" by donors and lobbyists. In a letter to Sir Keir on its website, People Demand Democracy urged Labour to ""hold new national elections with a proportional voting system and set up a House of Citizens within six months of getting into office"". The campaign warned Sir Keir that if he did not meet their demands, ""People Demand Democracy will take proportionate action to get our message across to you and the Labour Party leadership"". When asked how the security breach was allowed to happen, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said ""you can't bother Keir Starmer with stuff like that"". She told the BBC ""it's about power not protest, that's what Keir Starmer was talking about"". ""He kept going and made this amazing speech."" Sir Keir received multiple standing ovations during his speech, as he promised a ""decade of national renewal"" under a Labour government, including a plan for 1.5 million new homes. The incident is reminiscent of demonstrations during other speeches by party leaders and prime ministers at previous conferences. For example last year, Greenpeace campaigners heckled Liz Truss during her conference speech, and in 2017, a comedian was able to walk straight up to the stage and hand Theresa May a mock P45.

"Last night of the Proms: Sweltering heat fails to dampen the audience's spirits","By Mark Savage",2023-09-09,"The stifling heat of the Royal Albert Hall failed to dampen the spirits of eager Prommers, who celebrated the festival's Last Night in typical style. With temperatures in the 30s, the crowd nonetheless stomped, clapped and blew comedy horns throughout the traditional closing singalongs. Their enthusiasm delighted conductor Marin Alsop, who ordered several impromptu encores. She later paid tribute to the ""wonderfully robust"" audience. Many had queued from early in the morning to obtain one of the Proms' on-the-day tickets, which only offer standing access to the auditorium. ""You have to stand the whole time,"" Alsop marvelled. ""That's amazing because my feet are killing me, I don't know about you."" The audience also gave Alsop an extended ovation as she remarked that 2023 marked the 10th anniversary of her becoming the first woman to conduct the Last Night of the Proms. ""Apparently it's worthy of inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records,"" she said. ""And as silly as that is, it reminds me of how much work remains to build a more equitable world for the next generations."" There was also a show of support for the BBC Singers, who played a crucial role at the concert months after being threatened with closure as part of BBC cost-cutting measures. They won a temporary reprieve in March when external organisations approached the corporation to suggest alternative funding models. The choir's conductor, Sofi Jeannin, says the finer details of those discussions are still being ironed out - but that she's optimistic for the future. ""We are being told that the corporation is looking for longevity,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Front Row. ""We have been assured that we can continue programming in the future - and we are planning our centenary concert for next year."" Saturday's concert marked the first full-scale Last Night of the Proms since 2019, after some events were curtailed by Covid, and last year's show was cancelled after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. It opened on Richard Strauss's swashbuckling tone poem Don Juan, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra painting a pulse-quickening portrait of the promiscuous Spanish hero. Sheku Kanneh-Mason then gave a rich, sumptuous rendition of Max Bruch's Kol Nidrei, emphasising the warmth and humanity of the ancient Hebrew melodies. And soprano Lise Davidsen captivated the hall with the rich beauty of her voice, as she reprised the aria that propelled her to fame in 2015: Dich, teure halle, from Wagner's opera Tannhäuser. In fact, the Norwegian singer conspired to steal the show, with knock-out performances from Verdi's Macbeth and Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana, that provided ample evidence of why she's become one of opera's most in-demand stars. However, she dispensed with the Last Night tradition of dressing up in national costume (""I'm not going as a troll or a Viking!"" she told the BBC), opting instead for a series of opulent ball gowns. One particularly voluminous scarlet dress drew gasps of admiration from Radio 3 presenter Georgia Mann, who commented: ""I'm surprised she hasn't knocked over any music stands yet"". ""It's the largest, broadest, grandest dress I have ever seen,"" added her co-presenter Petroc Trelawny. The programme also featured several world premieres, including the theme music for the upcoming superhero film, The Marvels. Kanneh-Mason performed his part of the rhythmically driven score from a B-stage in the middle of the auditorium, illuminated by LED wristbands that had been handed out to the audience at the start of the show. The bands continued to pulse with colour as Davidsen performed the rambunctious Heia, heia, in den Bergen (Hey, in the mountains). Then the two soloists came together on the elegantly lyrical Bachianas Brasileiras, before the traditional medley of sea songs kicked off the beloved crowd participation sequence. Hundreds of flags waved in time to Rule, Britannia! and Pomp and Circumstance - with South Africa, Ireland, the USA, Norway, the EU and dozens of other nations represented. And eagle-eyed viewers spotted the BBC Symphony's lead flautist Michael Cox heroically soldiering through the final stretch, after party streamers threatened to clog up his mouthpiece. The night concluded with the first performance of God Save The King at the Proms since 1951, followed by the traditional chorus of Auld Lang Syne. This year saw the Proms spread its geographical wings further than before, with concerts in Londonderry, Great Yarmouth, Perth, Truro, Aberystwyth and a weekend-long residency at the Sage Gateshead. Overall, there were 84 concerts, performed by 37 orchestras, featuring more than 3,000 musicians. Ticket sales rose above pre-Covid levels, with 350,000 people attending a show. Highlights of the season included: The Proms will return next year on Friday, 19 July. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Newspaper headlines: Putin 'humiliated by mutiny' and Russia 'on the brink'","By BBC News",2023-06-25,"All of the front pages of Sunday's newspapers focus on the momentous and dramatic day in Russia as Wagner group mercenaries staged a rebellion in parts of the country. Some papers describe Vladimir Putin as being a president who is humiliated and his leadership has been left dented and damaged. The Sun on Sunday says President Putin has been ""pushed to the brink"" before the Wagner mercenaries halted their march towards Moscow as the paper puts it at the ""eleventh hour"". Russians will now see Putin is someone far weaker, according to the Sunday Express which claims the leader ""fled"" Moscow as mercenaries approached the capital. In the Sunday Telegraph British historian Robert Tombs believes while President Putin narrowly avoided a ""1917 moment"", he is ""gravely weakened"". But, writing in the paper he also has a warning for exiled Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin - adding ""mutineers tend to end up dead"". Prigozhin's last-minute de-escalation deal with President Putin prevented ""bloodshed"" on the streets of Russia, according to the front page of the Observer. While the paper makes a note of remarkable comments from the Mayor of Moscow who urged citizens to stay indoors. The Mail on Sunday asks whether the Kremlin ""bribed"" the leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to end the mutiny, as it cites UK security official sources. But, in the Sunday edition of the Daily Star the tabloid claims both sides are ""equally bonkers"". Elsewhere, the Sunday Times quotes a former donor to Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, who believes the groups are ""not accomplishing anything"". The paper says Trevor Neilson - who's a Californian entrepreneur - believes the movement has lost its way. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"UN climate talks in jeopardy in fossil fuel backlash","By Georgina Rannard",2023-12-12,"The UN climate talks in Dubai could be in jeopardy after some nations reacted furiously to a draft deal on fossil fuels they call ""weak"". The draft removed language included in a previous text suggesting that fossil fuels could be ""phased out"". All 198 countries at the summit must agree or there is no deal. A new amended version of the text is expected to be issued on Tuesday so that negotiations can continue. Humans burning fossil fuels is driving global warming, risking millions of lives, but governments have never agreed how or when to stop using them. A representative for the European Union called the draft ""unacceptable"" and said the bloc could walk away. ""We can't accept the text,"" said minister Eamon Ryan, a negotiator for the EU and Ireland's environment minister. But he added that the collapse of the talks is ""not the outcome the world needs"". Politicians, including from nations on the frontline of climate change, have been in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to discuss the growing problem in a year that is set to be the warmest on record. The question of what to do about greenhouse gas emissions from burning oil, coal and gas have dominated the talks. Expectations were low that the controversial COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber could deliver a strong deal on fossil fuels because he is also CEO of the Abu Dhabi oil giant Adnoc. But countries that want a rapid end to fossil fuels had grown optimistic as Mr Jaber appeared to say he backed a ""phase out"" of fossil fuels. A draft text published on Saturday confirmed that one option for the talks outcome was a ""phase out of fossil fuels in line with best available science"". Questions remained over when this would happen and whether it would rely on the use of expensive and experimental technology to store the carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels are burned. On Monday, another draft was published that deleted mentions of ""phase out"". Instead it said nations should ""reduce consumption and production of fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner"". While the changes in language can seem small, slight differences in UN documents can significantly change what countries are obliged to do. Many nations appear to have had just an hour to look at the text before a meeting of all governments was called. Countries on the frontline of climate change - places where sea-level rises are already destroying homes and storms are killing people - condemned the draft deal. ""We will not sign our death certificate,"" said a representative for the Alliance of Small Island States, adding it would not agree to a text without ""strong commitments on phasing out fossil fuels"". Mr Jaber, the COP28 president, said the text reflected his ambitions and called it a ""huge step forward"". But a spokesperson for the US said the part of the text about fossil fuels ""needs to be substantially strengthened"". And the UK called the draft ""disappointing"" and said it ""does not go far enough"". A spokesperson said ""there must be a phase out of unabated fossil fuels to meet our climate goals"". The Least Developed Countries Group said it could not accept the text, with its chairperson asking: ""Where is the ambition?"" Saudi Arabia, which has been reportedly blocking strong language on fossil phase out throughout the talks, did not respond to a request for comment. And developing nations that wanted more support in moving their economies away from fossil fuels to renewable energy are also likely to support a deal that places less emphasis on a rapid phase out of coal, oil and gas. The latest text did include a promise to treble renewable energy capacity by 2030, a pledge signed earlier in the talks by more than 100 nations. The draft appears to fall short of the standard for success laid out earlier on Monday by UN Secretary-General António Guterres. He said the talks will be judged on nations' ability to decide on the future of coal, oil and gas. The meeting will only be considered a success if it reaches ""consensus on the need to phase out fossil fuels in line with a timeline of 1.5C"", he said. Nations have promised to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The talks are officially supposed to finish on Tuesday but could overrun as nations argue over the final deal. What questions do you have about COP28?

"Extinction Rebellion co-founder Gail Bradbrook sentenced","By Dominic Casciani",2023-12-18,"The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion has received a 15-month suspended jail sentence after a marathon legal battle over her breaking a pane of glass. Dr Gail Bradbrook was convicted last month of causing more than £27,500 of damage to the Department for Transport. At Isleworth Crown Court, Judge Martin Edmunds KC said Bradbrook had a conscientious motive but that did not excuse her actions. During the sentencing hearing, she accused judges of ""mansplaining"". Bradbrook, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, was joined by a group of supporters dressed as suffragettes. In court, there was applause as the Extinction Rebellion (XR) activist finished her address to Judge Edmunds. In October 2019, during XR's second major protest that brought traffic chaos to parts of central London, Bradbrook climbed on to an entrance canopy at the headquarters of the Department for Transport (DfT). She used tools to break a large pane of reinforced security glass, which cost £27,660 to replace. During her police interview, she said she had been trying to stop crimes against humanity and ""had permission from nature"" to break the window. Over two trials she tried to make similar arguments despite being repeatedly directed not to do so by the judge because none of them amounted to a defence that a jury could consider. On Monday, Bradbrook told Judge Edmunds: ""It can't be that there's compelling, objective evidence of a threat to life, and that's just completely irrelevant to the whole legal process. ""I know that is not what justice seeks to serve."" Bradbrook's case is one of scores linked to environmental protests since 2018 in which activists said damage, or serious disruption, caused as part of civil disobedience was legally justified. She accused the courts in these cases of ""condescension"" and treating activists ""as if we were acting in good faith but slightly deranged"". ""I've had to listen to judges incorrectly characterising and, worse still, mansplaining the effectiveness of civil disobedience,"" she said. Becoming tearful, she concluded: ""God help us... life is being actively killed. We are compelled to act. The court systems of the UK are on trial, not myself. ""I wonder how history will judge this sentencing."" Judge Edmunds said Bradbrook had ""actively sought"" prosecution to attract publicity, and had wrongly tried to tell the jury that her actions had been legally necessary. ""As a matter of law, that was certainly incorrect for damage on this scale,"" he said. ""I put it down to an echo chamber of misinformation and wishful thinking. In many pre-trial hearings you accepted that the law did not provide you with a defence. Yet throughout, you have sought to avoid those penalties [for damaging the window] rather than accept them."" Earlier this year the Court of Appeal ruled that judges hearing environmental protest cases should not evaluate the merits of the cause. If a protester had been motivated by conscience, and the damage or disruption caused had not been excessive, judges were told to consider reducing the sentence. Judge Edmunds said that the damage and disruption caused by Bradbrook meant she would have normally have been jailed. But taking into account the Court of Appeal ruling and wider personal factors he suspended Bradbrook's prison sentence, meaning she could leave court a free woman - but could be jailed if she commits another crime in the next 15 months. She was also ordered to also carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"Just Stop Oil: More than 40 activists charged over protests",NA,2023-11-08,"More than 40 Just Stop Oil (JSO) supporters have been charged after protesters blocked Whitehall and the glass covering a painting at the National Gallery was smashed. Two men have been charged with criminal damage in relation to the broken glass on Diego Velazquez's Rokeby Venus. The Met Police added 42 people were charged over the marches in Whitehall. In the past nine days, 219 JSO activists have been arrested and 98 charged. The demonstrations, part of JSO's ongoing protest action against the government granting new oil and gas licences, saw more than 100 people arrested on Monday alone. Harrison Donnelly, 20, from Nottingham, and Hanan Ameur, 22, from Islington, north London, are accused of criminal damage after the 17th century Rokeby Venus was targeted - the same painting slashed by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914.

"Whitney Wolfe Herd: How the Bumble boss changed the dating scene","By Imran Rahman-Jones & Shiona McCallum",2023-11-12,"Out of adversity comes opportunity, so the saying goes. For Whitney Wolfe Herd, that meant taking a difficult exit from online dating app firm Tinder - which she sued for sexual harassment - and setting up Bumble, her own rival company with a focus very much on women. Nearly a decade and a billion dollar fortune later, Ms Wolfe Herd announced this week that she is stepping down as Bumble's boss. But it is a bittersweet moment. In an interview with the BBC before she made her announcement, Ms Wolfe Herd lamented that, as a group of young women who came up in tech in the 2010s, not many are left. ""It is disappointing to see just how little women have advanced,"" she said. ""I've watched the fall of what people call 'the girl boss era'. That's tragic."" However, Bumble will still be led by a woman - Lidiane Jones, the former boss of Slack, will take over as chief executive while Ms Wolfe Herd will stay on as executive chair. When she launched Bumble in 2014, unlike other apps at the time, it was focused on female empowerment in the dating scene - where women who date men would have to make the de facto ""first move"" to message a new match. ""The gender dynamics of dating and romance still seemed so outdated. I thought, what if I could flip that on its head?"" Ms Wolfe Herd wrote in a 2020 blog post of the app's conception. Less than seven years later, Ms Wolfe Herd would become the world's youngest female self-made billionaire. A 2017 Bumble ad campaign encouraged women to ""be the CEO your parents always wanted you to marry (then find someone you actually like)"". Ms Wolfe Herd chaired panel talks, created networking events and promoted women in business. Her Instagram shows her taking her young sons into Bumble HQ, appearing on magazine covers and hanging out with the likes of Hollywood A-lister Reese Witherspoon. ""I don't really look at my life as a division of work and personal. I blend it,"" she recently told the BBC. ""And maybe that works for me. And maybe it doesn't work for someone else. But I will tell you, it is hard."" Ms Wolfe Herd has said that in the past her life has ""been pretty dark"". She has previously said that her ambition ""comes from abusive relationships"", referring to a boyfriend she had as a teenager (her ex-boyfriend has denied all the claims). Shortly after exiting her role at Tinder she launched a legal case accusing another of the co-founders, whom she had been in a relationship with, of sexual harassment. Tinder's parent company, Match Group, denied the claims but paid around $1m to settle the dispute. ""I was super depressed, I was paranoid,"" she said of that time, telling the Diary of a CEO podcast that she didn't leave the house for three weeks and was ""drinking too much"". She says she was pulled through by her now-husband, Texas oil heir Michael Herd. She was also supported by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev, founder of dating app Badoo. Ms Wolfe Herd did not plan on making another dating app, but it was Mr Andreev who convinced her. They flew to Mykonos in the summer of 2014 with some ex-Tinder employees and worked on the idea. Within a few months of her leaving Tinder, Ms Wolfe Herd had launched Bumble. She was 25 years old. By the age of 31, she would - for a few months at least - be a billionaire. The majority of the company's staff in the early days were women - a rare sight in the tech world - and its brand was based around female empowerment. Bumble's defining feature was that after a match, women would be the first to message. It was designed like this to give women more control in the online dating space, but over time has sought to become more gender inclusive - allowing anyone to message first in same-gender matches or those between two non-binary people. The app bans users who body shame others, and similar to other dating apps, it uses AI to detect nude photos sent in private chats and lets the recipient choose to view or block the images. It backed women's safety campaigns, such as calling for cyber-flashing to be made illegal in the UK and EU. The UK did make it a criminal offence under the Online Safety Act 2023 after calls from multiple campaigners. But it wasn't all plain sailing. In 2019, Andrey Andreev sold his majority stake in Bumble's parent company and left the business after Forbes investigated allegations of a toxic and misogynistic workplace in the London office. Mr Andreev denied the allegations against him. Ms Wolfe Herd said at the time that she never saw any toxic behaviour in the office, adding: ""Andrey has never been anything but kind and respectful to me."" The app's user base grew, and by 2021 it had over 40 million profiles on it. It created apps for friendship - Bumble BFF - and business networking. Badoo was later incorporated into its parent company, Bumble Inc, and when Bumble Inc went public in February 2021, Ms Wolfe Herd became a billionaire overnight. She held her young son as she rang the Nasdaq bell and yellow ticker tape cascaded around her. Shares traded for about $75 back then. But by November of that year, they were worth less than half of that and Forbes reported that she had lost her billionaire status. Now, despite growing revenue and an increase in users who pay for extra features, the share price is under $14. Match Group, Bumble's rival that owns Tinder and Hinge, has also seen its share price drop in that time. Perhaps it's a sign of the inherent difficulty in the online dating business. If the apps work well, people get together and stop being customers. If they do not work well, users may become disillusioned and eventually delete them. Bumble already uses AI to filter out pictures or messages that violate its policies. But Ms Wolfe Herd says they will be taking it to the next level in the future. The focus is to facilitate better interactions on the app - ""coaching people"" as she puts it - through suggesting better photos, bios or even chats with other people. She wants to use AI to help ""teach people and show them and guide them, how to behave better"" and to ""instil confidence in all of our daters"". She adds: ""How can generative AI actually get you into a healthy, empowering, productive conversation, cut through the noise, cut through the friction? And then get you offline?"" It's also a recognition that what people want is face-to-face meet-ups - whether through the dating app or through the friendship or business apps. However from January, it will be Ms Wolfe Herd's successor, Lidiane Jones, who has to deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Eight things Suella Braverman said that made headlines","By Dominic Casciani",2023-11-13,"Suella Braverman has been sacked as home secretary - leaving one of the most important jobs in government for a second time in just over a year. She has been no stranger to controversy in her time in office. Mrs Braverman resigned from the same job while Liz Truss was prime minister before being brought back into government a week later by Rishi Sunak. Here are eight things she said that made headlines - and caused controversy. ""I would love to have a front page of the Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda, that's my dream, it's my obsession."" This was said at a fringe event at last year's Conservative Party conference, shortly after she had been appointed as home secretary by Liz Truss. She was referring to the government's asylum plan, to take asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel to the UK on a one-way ticket to Rwanda where they could claim asylum instead. Mrs Braverman faced criticism from refugee groups and others for trivialising the plight of people in need. The most important point about the quote is not whether you agree with its tone, but that the new home secretary was making clear her single priority would be controlling migration. ""Tofu-eating wokerati"" One of Suella Braverman's first tasks as home secretary was to pilot through Parliament a plan to restrict the right to protest in order to stop highly disruptive stunts by groups, including Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil - such as motorway occupations. She accused the opposition of being in league with eco-protesters because a previous version of the measures had failed to win enough support. ""I am afraid that it is the Labour Party, the Lib Dems, the coalition of chaos, the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati and, dare I say, the anti-growth coalition that we have to thank for the disruption we are seeing on our roads today."" ""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility: I resign"" The very next day Mrs Braverman sensationally quit as home secretary, after confessing to a serious blunder. She had sent a confidential and sensitive government email to her own Gmail account and then forwarded it to her confidante and Tory backbencher, John Hayes. However, the real story here was the timing. The incident had happened some time earlier - and her resignation came as Liz Truss was on the precipice and her government in turmoil. In her resignation letter, Mrs Braverman accused the embattled PM of breaking key pledges. The next day, Liz Truss resigned as prime minister. Less than a week later, Mrs Braverman's serious ministerial error was forgiven by the new prime minister, Rishi Sunak - and she was back in the same job. ""The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast."" There had been months of rising political tension over small boat crossings - and at the end of October 2022, a man firebombed the government's arrivals centre for the migrants in Dover's docks. Separately, independent inspectors warned conditions were ""wretched"" at a migrant reception camp. Mrs Braverman came out fighting in the Commons, but days later, she was confronted in her constituency by 83-year-old Holocaust survivor Joan Salter. ""When I hear you using words against refugees like 'swarms' and an 'invasion',"" she said, ""I am reminded of the language used to dehumanise and justify the murder of my family and millions of others."" ""There are 100 million people around the world who could qualify for protection under our current laws. Let us be clear - they are coming here."" For the second time in two years, the government launched a new immigration plan. Parliament eventually voted to place a legal duty on the home secretary to not only detain anyone crossing the English Channel, but also remove them to another country, such as Rwanda. In the Commons, Mrs Braverman stuck to her guns and made the 100 million claim. The next day, she doubled-down, telling the Daily Mail there was ""likely billions"" eager to come to the UK. She returned to analysing migrant trends at the Conservative Party conference, last month, declaring: ""The wind of change that carried my own parents across the globe in the 20th Century was a mere gust compared with the hurricane that is coming."" Experts have disputed her projections, saying the UK receives far fewer asylum seekers than other countries, and that recent record numbers of arrivals of workers and students will likely level off. ""Multiculturalism makes no demands of the incomer to integrate. It has failed."" The daughter of immigrants from Mauritius and Kenya, Mrs Braverman told an American think tank that migrants end up living ""parallel lives"" - a phrase first used 20 years ago in relation to complex riots in northern England. Opponents said she had given up fixing the UK's broken asylum system and was trying to set out her stall for the Tory leadership. ""We cannot allow our streets to be taken over by rows of tents occupied by people, many of them from abroad, living on the streets as a lifestyle choice."" That social media post came amid government backroom wrangling over what would make it into this year's King's Speech. Mrs Braverman reportedly wanted to impose fines on charities who give tents to rough sleepers. Her push to get the police included triggered an internal row with colleagues. The idea was not included in the speech. ""There's only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches."" Speaking after a government emergency meeting over the crisis in Gaza, Mrs Braverman laid into the pro-Palestinian demonstrators amid rows over whether their chants amounted to antisemitic attacks. And it's the row that has ultimately led to her downfall. On 8 November, the Times newspaper published a column by the Mrs Braverman where she repeated the phrase - and also accused the police of bias, saying they were ""playing favourites"" with some demonstrations and using stronger tactics against some and not others. This triggered accusations of political interference in independent policing - an absolute red line that ministers cannot cross under British laws. Her comments were condemned by former police officers, MPs and Labour, who accused her of ""deliberately creating division"". Four days later - and following clashes between protesters, counter-protesters and police in London on Armistice Day - she was sacked. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Why Suella Braverman can't stop Palestinian protests","By Dominic Casciani",2023-11-09,"As things stand, there is going to be a potentially huge pro-Palestinian march in London, on Armistice Day - and there is nothing Home Secretary Suella Braverman alone can do to stop it. The reason for that is simple: the law does not tell the Met Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley to take into account the views of ministers. It tells him to assess the risks to the public - and make a plan accordingly. Since the Gaza conflict began, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has organised three national protests in London on successive Saturdays that have grown larger week-on-week. It has negotiated with the police over the route and duration of each and abided by conditions. The police have a delicate balancing act to perform in protecting free speech and assembly - and also protecting the rights of others not to be intimidated. The Met says where protesters have supported terrorist groups, broken racial-hatred laws, or committed other offences, they have made arrests. So far, more than 200 have been arrested - each serious in its own terms, including some allegations of support for Hamas - which is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. But put those numbers in the wider context of public order policing in London. On Monday alone, police arrested 219 Just Stop Oil demonstrators who tried to stop traffic near Parliament. The Extinction Rebellion ""sit-ins"" of more than two years ago saw officers cart away a staggering 4,118 demonstrators. Opponents of the PSC say marchers are chanting deeply antisemitic slogans and providing a cover for extremists. But while individuals can be arrested for hate crime offences, the legal test for banning an event is more complex. The Public Order Act 1986 gives Sir Mark Rowley and other police chiefs the power to apply conditions to marches where they reasonably believe there could be: The PSC has agreed to conditions under that law. Its supporters say they will gather an hour after the two-minute silence on Armistice Day and more than a mile away from the Cenotaph. Their march, ending with a rally at the US Embassy, is planned to go nowhere near the memorial. Rishi Sunak has described holding a march on Armistice Day as disrespectful and a risk to the Cenotaph or other memorials. But given the PSC has repeatedly abided by conditions imposed on its previous marches, the only conclusion the police can reach - unless they get intelligence to the contrary - is that a risk to the Cenotaph won't come from protesters on the march route. And that's why the force has concluded there is no legal justification to ask the home secretary to ban the march. That power can only be used if a police chief believes they cannot prevent ""serious public disorder"". That basically means violent crowds potentially bent on running amok. The police haven't seen that in previous weeks. So if police commanders asked the home secretary to ban the march, the organisers could go to court - and judges would need to see evidence and intelligence proving the serious risk. Do you plan to attend a protest? Get in touch. The last time these powers were used was in 2011 and 2012. The then-home secretary, on the recommendation of the Met, banned the far-right English Defence League (EDL) from marching through Muslim communities. The EDL was considered to be a thuggish mob and marchers would regularly chant racist or Islamophobic slogans. The Campaign Against Antisemitism says the ""River to the Sea"" chant, that will almost certainly be heard on Saturday's march, is deeply offensive and threatening - but the PSC event is not going through Jewish communities - and the Met says that its legal advice is that the slogan can be legitimate free speech in such circumstances. What would happen if the march were banned? The Met believes people would still come to London and stand in the street and peacefully have their say. The police cannot stop them. The last time they tried, it was a fiasco. In March 2021, the organisers of a vigil for murdered Londoner Sarah Everard cancelled the event. They feared they would individually face enormous fines under the then Covid lockdown rules, if they were seen to encourage the gathering. But there was such confusion over whether there was still a right to protest, regardless of the risk of transmitting the virus, that people turned out anyway. They felt so strongly about the horrific murder they wanted to be heard. The Met ended up paying compensation to women who were arrested. So the huge risk is that, even if Suella Braverman got her way, people would not only come out, but they would march independently. That would be twice as hard for police because there would be no organisers on the ground directing events and calling on people to abide by a route and curfew. And then there is the risk of counter-demonstrations. Former Met commander Dal Babu says Ms Braverman's attack on the forthcoming march has emboldened the extreme far right. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founder of the largely defunct English Defence League under the alias Tommy Robinson, is calling on followers to join him near the Cenotaph. Other less well known figures are doing the same. ""I've never known an occasion for the home secretary to get involved in operational policing at this level,"" says Mr Babu. ""She doesn't understand the law. She doesn't understand the legislation."" So is there anything the home secretary could do to force the Met to ban the march? If Ms Braverman is satisfied that the Met is ""failing to discharge any of its functions in an effective manner"" she can direct the Mayor of London to intervene. But that is a power designed to be used in exceptional circumstances. And she is not allowed to use that power until she has first consulted the inspectorate of police forces, the expert body on how chief constables are performing. Sir Tom Winsor, former HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Ms Braverman had ""crossed the line"". ""The operational independence of the police is not a debatable matter,"" he said. ""The policing protocol order made by this home secretary in June 2023... stresses the operational independence of the police. ""It is the will of Parliament and the government that the police shall not be open to improper political interference that the police must act with impartiality, including political impartiality.""

"Just Stop Oil Dartford bridge protester released from jail, says group","By Lewis Adams",2023-12-12,"A Just Stop Oil protester who scaled the Dartford Crossing bridge has been released from prison, the group has said. Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed in April for three years for causing a public nuisance. He has spent about 14 months in custody including time on remand. His co-defendant Marcus Decker, a German national, is still in prison and the environmental campaign group is campaigning against his deportation. Decker was jailed for two years and seven months for the same offence. Trowland said ""it's a beautiful day"" in a video posted on X after his release. The structural engineer, of Islington, north London, and his co-defendant Decker, of no fixed address, caused gridlock traffic on the M25 after the pair climbed the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge on 17 October last year and remained suspended on cables for about 37 hours. Trowland argued during the trial at Basildon Crown Court that it was a peaceful protest and that they tried to ""deliver a warning message"" over government oil and gas licences. The United Nations has criticised the length of the sentences. An online petition started by Decker's partner, which calls on the Home Office to stop his deportation, has about 145,000 signatures. A government spokesperson previously said: ""Foreign nationals who commit crimes here in the UK will face the full force of the law, including deportation."" The trial in April was told almost 565,000 drivers faced delays due to the protest. Essex Police claimed a heavily pregnant woman could not get urgent medical help due to the traffic, with another person having to miss a best friend's funeral.

"Yorkshire: Plane skids and Sinfield heroics among 2023 photos","By Tom Airey",2023-12-31,"Kevin Sinfield's heroics, a jet skidding off a runway, the loss of a Barnsley interviewing icon - just a few of the memorable moments 2023 provided in Yorkshire. The year started with swimmers taking a chilly dip on 1 January in Scarborough and ended with wild weather battering the region in late December. Parts of Yorkshire saw royal visits from King Charles III and The Princess of Wales during the last twelve months, and in August we lost TV royalty Sir Michael Parkinson aged 88. BBC Yorkshire looks back at a few of the most striking images and news stories which wowed us during the year. The Princess of Wales came to Kirkgate Market in Leeds in January, meeting shoppers and stallholders. Shirley Wainwright, 75, from Harrogate, said she made Kate laugh when she told her: ""I didn't know love, you were coming. It was a complete surprise. ""I'm just on the bus from Harrogate when I came across you."" After the market visit, the princess travelled to the University of Leeds and met students from the Childhood Studies programme, which focuses on a broad approach to early childhood development. In February, former BBC Breakfast host and current Channel 5 presenter Dan Walker had a fortunate escape while cycling in his home city. Mr Walker was struck by a car on Moore Street in Sheffield city centre, telling people he was ""glad to be alive"" after the crash. Posting on social media, he said: ""Face is a mess but I don't think anything is broken."" Staying in Sheffield, a heart-warming ""get well soon"" message was left on the Royal Hallamshire Hospital's car park after heavy snowfall in the city. Snow fell across much of Yorkshire during March, causing travel delays and stranded vehicles. After the snow had melted away, it took teamwork in West Yorkshire to raise a giant wooden cross. The 30ft (9.1m) Chevin Cross was carried to the top of Otley Chevin, a tradition which has taken place every year since 1969. The cross is put up by volunteers two weeks before Easter Sunday and taken down again two weeks afterwards. Team work was also required to remove the carcass of a 55ft (17m) fin whale from Bridlington's South Beach in East Yorkshire. The stricken 30-tonne animal got into difficulties in early May before later dying. East Riding of Yorkshire Council described its removal as ""incredibly challenging and difficult"". The first ever Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon in May ended with an emotional moment between the former Leeds Rhinos star and ex-teammate Kevin Sinfield, who were among the 12,000 taking part. Rugby league legend Sinfield stopped short of the finish to carry Burrow, who has motor neurone disease, over the finish line. Later in the year, Sinfield completed seven ultra-marathons over seven days in seven cities, raising more than £1m for people affected by the disease. King Charles III visited Yorkshire multiple times in 2023, including a stop at Pickering's station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. The volunteer-run heritage railway celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, with the King calling in on 12 June. He greeted crowds in North Yorkshire after arriving on the Royal train, which was pulled by the famous Flying Scotsman locomotive. July saw Parliament's youngest MP elected, with Labour's Keir Mather winning the Selby and Ainsty by-election. The 25 year old overturned a 20,137 majority in the North Yorkshire constituency and has been nicknamed the ""baby of the House"". Selby and Ainsty had been under Conservative control since the seat was created in 2010. A critically endangered Amur leopard cub took its first outdoor steps at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster in September. The leopard is said to be one of the rarest cats in the world, with only about 120 left in the wild. Dr Charlotte McDonald, the park's animal director, said it was ""the only surviving cub born in Europe this year"". Yorkshire icon Sir Michael Parkinson died aged 88 on 16 August, with stars of stage, screen and sport sharing tributes from all over the globe. The Cudworth-born star, who started his career in journalism on the Barnsley Chronicle, went on to have a TV career spanning seven decades and interviewed some of the world's biggest names. Storm Babet caused travel problems and flooding in October, with a TUI flight from Corfu coming off the Leeds Bradford Airport runway while landing amid heavy rain and wind. ""Suddenly there was just loads of mud that hit the windows, which was a bit of a shock,"" passenger Nicola Lewellen told the BBC. Ms Lewellen, 45, from Bradford, said there had been a ""collective gasp of shock"" from passengers, who were all evacuated safely.

"Oxfordshire weekly round-up: 29 October - 4 November 2023",NA,2023-11-05,"A look at the life of legendary crime novelist Dame Agatha Christie was among our most read stories this week in Oxfordshire. A variety of local issues featured on the BBC News website, BBC Radio Oxford and South Today. We have picked five stories to keep you up to date. A council rejected a proposal from an Oxford college to build up to 540 homes to the north of a village due to flood risks. Merton College's application for affordable properties on a site near Yarnton, Oxfordshire, had been recommended for refusal at Cherwell District Council (CDC). Residents raised concerns the plans did not take into account ""existing flooding issues"" affecting the village. Dame Agatha Christie, one of the bestselling novelists of all time, but ironically, something of a mystery herself. The writer, who died in 1976 aged 85, wrote 66 detective novels, 14 short story collections and more than 20 plays. Many of her most well-known works have been adapted into films, including Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. She spent more than 40 years of her life on the outskirts of Wallingford in Oxfordshire - but kept such a low profile that many of the locals did not know she lived nearby. A hospital has submitted proposals for a new complex of operating theatres to help meet patient demand. Plans for the building at the John Radcliffe Hospital were sent to the city council by Carter Jonas on behalf of Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Foundation Trust. They include seven elective theatres with ""associated infrastructure, landscaping and parking"". Awesome Books in Wallingford is home to more than four million second-hand books. Set up in 2003 by brothers Mubin and Taskeen Ahmed to save books from being pulped, every day they receive 300,000 books which are resold around the world. They also donate 100,000 books every month to literacy programmes in the UK and overseas. Thames Water is set to axe 300 roles after an ""extremely challenging year"". The GMB union said it had been told 140 people were at risk of redundancy, including 89 retail roles and 39 digital jobs. The other positions are currently vacant, the water firm said. The union blamed the company, saying public money had been ""drained from the system"". But Thames Water said the plan was necessary, adding it would seek to minimise compulsory redundancies.

"Just Stop Oil: Westminster protest sees 31 charged",NA,2023-10-31,"More than 30 people have been charged following a Just Stop Oil protest in Westminster. The Metropolitan Police said 31 people had been charged on Tuesday after activists caused disruption in Parliament Square on Monday. It added that 14 were remanded in custody and 17 had been bailed to court. Demonstrators lay on the floor of every corner of the square on Monday after marching around in orange jackets. Many of the protesters were then handcuffed by police after refusing to move. The Met said 61 arrests were made at the demonstration under section seven of the Public Order Act. This allows officers to make an arrest if a protester ""disproportionately interferes with road transport infrastructure"".

"Climate anxiety: Why we won't be flying home for Christmas","By Riyah Collins",2023-12-23,"Whether it's driving, hopping on the train or catching a bus, there's a chance you'll be packing a bag and heading home for Christmas. For most of us, there isn't much that would keep us away from family over the festive period. But some people, like activists Aliza Ayaz and Sean Currie, have made the choice to put the environment above everything else. They won't be seeing their relatives this year after they decided to drastically limit or stop flying altogether. Aliza tells BBC Newsbeat thinking about flights brings ""the anxiety of 'Oh my God, I can't do it because of the carbon footprint'. ""But also, my parents could really use seeing me because I'm their eldest daughter."" Aliza was born in Dubai to Pakistani parents who now live in Saudi Arabia. She studies at University College London, where she set up its Climate Action Society, and is now a UN youth ambassador for sustainable development. The 25-year-old says her anxiety never goes away ""because the carbon footprint of one flight is so enormous, especially a long-haul flight"". According to the International Civil Aviation Organization's emissions calculator, a return flight from London to Riyadh generates about 620kg of CO2 per passenger. It's a similar story for Sean Currie. The 26-year-old left his family home in the Scottish Highlands and moved to Belgium for work in 2019. He's since decided to stop flying, and admits the journey over land and sea takes so long that he no longer visits very often. ""For three years I didn't see my half-sister or niece,"" he says. Sean says his other sister lives in the Philippines - an 18-hour flight away - and he's ""just come to terms with the fact that I will never visit her"". ""I don't think that I can justify to myself the impact that it has on the world,"" he says. Sean works with Stay Grounded, a group which campaigns for the aviation industry to be made smaller. He says his main activities are ""non-disruptive"", including lobbying and writing to politicians, but he has also been involved in direct protests. Sean recently joined a group of hundreds who blocked access to two airports in Europe. While these types of tactics are sometimes criticised when used by groups such as Just Stop Oil, Sean tells Newsbeat his more direct activities target private jets and not everyday travellers. But he says he doesn't condemn protests that might affect the lives of ordinary people. ""The disruption that will be caused by drought, floods and food shortages will be a whole lot more disruptive that somebody sitting in traffic,"" he says. Sean counts himself as lucky that, even if the journeys are long, trains and buses are an option for him. ""Train travel can be a wonderful thing,"" he says. ""But, to be honest, I don't enjoy buses."" Neither of those are realistic options for Aliza though. She can't totally rule out getting on a plane so made the decision to limit herself to one flight a year, taking an extended trip to make it as worthwhile as possible. While her parents have been supportive, she says ""you can see that they're upset in their eyes, and they would like to see more of me and I would like to see more of them"". She'll instead spend Christmas with her partner's family in Leeds, while Sean heads to his wife's family home in Italy on the train. Instead the pair will rely on technology to feel connected to their families. ""We'll get on a call together, we'll cook meals together or mum will watch us and then we'll talk about everything from our days,"" Aliza says. Sean and his family play online games together and he has a special routine with his sister in the Philippines, which is seven hours ahead of Belgium. ""My sister adapts her schedule so that when she calls us she's still in some type of Christmas mood,"" he says. ""She makes sure that she opens some presents when she's on the call, even if it means leaving them unopened most of the day."" But there are some things he misses back home, particularly a big Hogmanay party. ""There's a real kind of tradition around it in my village that I love to be part of,"" he says. Although they stand by their decisions not to fly this Christmas, sometimes Sean and Aliza grapple with the sacrifice. ""I do wonder how meaningful it is for me to cut down my flying, especially when there's so many factors that make you feel that it's unfair,"" Aliza says. ""There's people often doing short-haul trips, multiple holidays in a year, and I don't even get to see my family."" But Anna Hughes - the director of Flight Free UK, a charity which encourages people to pledge to not fly for a year - says it's important to know that individuals can make a difference. ""The majority of flights come from people flying from on holiday,"" she says. Anna believes if enough people choose alternative travel like trains or destinations closer to home, the industry will respond to that. She uses veganism as an example, saying: ""I've been vegan for about 10 years and when I started, people would just look at me funny and offer me a salad. ""Now they give me a menu. Things have changed, and they change quickly. ""We all have to remember that our individual action does say something."" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

"Fears of higher oil prices after Red Sea attacks","By Nick Edser",2023-12-19,"Attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea risk pushing up the price of oil and other goods, analysts have warned. Several firms have paused shipments through the route after vessels were attacked by Houthi rebels in Yemen. The world's second largest shipping line, Maersk, said on Tuesday that it would reroute some of its vessels around Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The disruption has led the US to launch an international naval operation to protect ships on the Red Sea route. Countries joining the security action - named Operation Prosperity Guardian - include the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain. The US has also said it would welcome China playing a constructive role in trying to prevent further attacks. The analysts' warnings came as the rebels vowed to continue their attacks in the Bab al-Mandeb strait, a vital shipping lane between Asia and Europe. ""Even if America succeeds in mobilising the entire world, our military operations will not stop... no matter the sacrifices it costs us,"" said senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti on X, formerly Twitter. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin held a virtual meeting with ministers from more than 40 countries on Tuesday, and called on more nations to contribute to the security efforts. ""These reckless Houthi attacks are a serious international problem and they demand a firm international response,"" he said. The UK's Ministry of Defence said the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Diamond would join the new task force, with the security situation ""deteriorating"". The Red Sea is one of the world's most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments, as well as for consumer goods. It is bookended by the Bab al-Mandab Strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - in the south near the coast of Yemen and the Suez Canal in the north. Houthis have declared their backing for Hamas in its war with the Israelis and the rebels based in Yemen said they were targeting vessels which they believe are heading for Israel. However, some firms, such as Investor Chemical Tankers, whose Swan Atlantic vessel was attacked on Monday, said that its ship had no links to Israel. Shipping firms have reported vessels coming under attack from drones and missiles. ""The ballistic missiles are really the tough one. This is the first time we've ever seen ships hit by this type of weapon,"" Sal Mercogliano, a naval historian at Campbell University, told the BBC. ""It's a very difficult type of missile to shoot down."" Despite the launch of the international operation to ensure safe passage through the Red Sea, Maersk said it was not clear when it would resume journeys along the route, and would assess things on a case-by-case basis. It said while it was pleased to hear of efforts to improve security in the area, ""at this time it remains difficult to determine"" when it would return to the Red Sea route. Meanwhile, Hapag-Lloyd, a German firm whose Al Jasrah vessel was attacked last Friday, said that while it welcomed the new task force, the company needed 100% assurance the Red Sea was safe for ships to return. The alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope, adds about 3,500 nautical miles to the journey. Hapag-Lloyd's head of corporate communications Nils Haupt told the BBC: ""We go from the eastern Med to Singapore. Normally it takes 13 days through the [Suez] Canal - without using the canal that will be 31 days."" Attacks on ships have intensified in recent days. Investor Chemical Tankers said its Swan Atlantic tanker was hit by an ""unidentified object"" on Monday, while Maersk described the situation as ""alarming"" on Friday after a ""near-miss"" incident involving Maersk Gibraltar and another attack on a container ship. Oil giant BP said on Monday that it would temporarily pause all shipments of crude through the route. Rival energy giant Shell has yet to comment. At the moment, changes to the oil price have been minimal. Prices rose 1% on Monday, but on Tuesday they were little changed with benchmark Brent crude trading at around $78 a barrel. As petrol is derived from oil, increases in the price of crude usually feed through to higher costs at the pump. But Simon Williams, the RAC motoring group's fuel spokesman, said while tankers avoiding the Red Sea had the ""potential to push up the oil price, the barrel is still below $80, $15 lower than it was at the end of September"". ""Talk of this immediately affecting fuel prices is unhelpful as we are still waiting for retailers to fully pass on the savings from much lower wholesale costs. We don't want to give them a reason not to continuing cutting their prices, especially at the most expensive time of the year,"" he added. Mr Williams argued current petrol prices at £1.42 should be around 10p cheaper on average. ""This means even if the Red Sea situation worsens, there is no reason for the biggest retailers to push up prices as fuel is still overpriced,"" he added. Richard Meade, editor-in-chief of shipping newspaper Lloyd's List, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What is going to be very interesting is if the tankers continue to reroute. ""That's a much more finely balanced market that could have serious implications for the global supply chain."" But rerouting will affect more than just oil. Mr Meade said 12% of global trade was taken through the Red Sea, which is about $1 trillion worth of goods a year. ""We've seen most of the main container carriers - these are the ones that carry finished goods, TVs, electronics, trainers - they have almost exclusively started rerouting,"" he said. Hapag-Lloyd told the BBC that it will have rerouted 25 ships by the end of the year, costing it tens of millions of dollars as the ships were booked before the attacks. However, it said new orders would ""probably"" see a rise in costs. ""This industry is keeping world trade alive and attacks on merchant shipping are unacceptable,"" said  Mr Haupt. Marco Forgiona, from the Institute of Export and International Trade, told the BBC that rerouting would increase fuel and insurance costs for shipping, ""and then you've got the issue that the ships are in the wrong place, the containers are in the wrong place and you get the potential for congestion at the ports and further delays"". However, Mr Haupt said that while he expected to see congestion at some ports in a few weeks, ""I don't think it will be as tough as we have seen it during Covid. ""Yes we will see some disruption and we might see delays, but I would not expect this to be a total disruption of the supply chain."" S&P Global Market Intelligence said that nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. A rise in oil prices can lead to higher inflation, which measures the pace of price rises. Inflation has been falling in the UK and is currently 4.6%. New figures out on Wednesday will show whether it has continued to drop but, at the current level, it is still more than twice the Bank of England's 2% target. The Bank has, until recent months, been raising interest rates to cool inflation. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Pair deny Just Stop Oil snooker protest charges","By Jordan Reynolds",2024-01-16,"A student and a former museum worker have appeared in court after the World Snooker Championship was disrupted by a Just Stop Oil protest. The first-round match at Sheffield's Crucible theatre between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry was interrupted by a man who clambered on the table and threw orange paint powder on 17 April 2023. University student Edred Ilmari Heath Whittingham appeared at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Tuesday charged with criminal damage. Margaret Reid, a former museum professional, appeared at the same court charged with attempting to cause criminal damage. They both pleaded not guilty.  A woman was prevented from executing a similar stunt on the other table in play after being tackled by referee Olivier Marteel. Mr Whittingham, 26, of May Street, Exeter, and Ms Reid, 53, of Low Fellside, Kendal, Cumbria, were given unconditional bail by District Judge Daniel Curtis until their trial on 10 May at the same court.

"How portable X-ray machines are helping remote patients","By Christine Ro",2024-01-08,"Portable X-ray machines ""can literally be the difference between life and death"", says radiographer Sam Pilkington. For most of us, if we need to be X-rayed the procedure is done in a hospital. But for acutely unwell patients, or for infection control, Miss Pilkington says that portable machines are very helpful. This is because ""they remove the excess burden of transportation from the patients"", says the final-year student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, who is also a member of the Institute of Physics. Instead the X-ray equipment goes to them. There are obvious advantages for remote locations, including battlefields, roadsides and disaster zones. And thanks to the increased availability - and ability - of such portable systems their usage is growing rapidly. With the coronavirus pandemic fuelling this increase, the global portable X-ray market was worth a reported $7.1bn (£5.6bn) last year. And this is expected to rise to $14bn by 2028. In simple terms there are two types of portable X-ray machines - those on wheels, which are generally described as ""mobile"", and the lightest devices that can be carried by a single person. These are generally described as ""ultraportable"". One remote place that has tested ultraportable X-ray hardware is the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Prior to a trial there from November 2021 to January 2022, 73% of patients who were due for an X-ray did not attend their appointments - due in large part to the costs and time needed to reach distant hospitals. During the trial, a handheld device made by Japanese firm Fujifilm was taken to local clinics. Called the Fujifilm Xair, it weighs just 3.5kg, and is only 301mm (12 inches) wide and 144mm tall. As a result of its use, the non-attendance rate for X-rays appointments was reduced to zero. As one patient commented to the subsequent report: ""This is hugely beneficial to people on the small islands. Much less upheaval for frailer patients."" German company OR Technology is another manufacturer of portable X-ray machines. Tim Thurn, its chief commercial officer, says it is seeing great interest from emerging markets. ""There's a huge demand for bringing healthcare to the people,"" he says. In the Philippines, Nigeria and other countries in the developing world, portable X-ray systems are transforming screening for tuberculosis (TB), which kills approximately 1.3 million people a year despite being preventable and curable. It's long been known that a chest X-ray is the best screening tool for TB, explains Suvanand Sahu, the deputy executive director of the Stop TB Partnership. This Swiss-based organisation represents more than 1,500 government and non-government bodies around the world. But he says that access to X-rays was historically hampered by a lack of hospitals. This was particularly the case in remote areas, and among remote, nomadic and displaced groups. Dr Sahu says that portable X-ray machines, which often include artificial intelligence software to quickly process the images, have been a powerful solution that allows detection to be successfully done out in the field. ""About 10 years ago, if we would have said 'we can we do an X-ray in the community, with the computer reading it', I think people would have jumped out of their seats. But it has happened now."" Dr Sahu adds that the AI has enabled a ""quantum leap"" in how accurately and quickly these X-rays can be read. Yet some are worried about the radiation released by portable X-ray machines. Portable X-ray equipment works in the same way as the big, fixed machines in radiology departments in hospitals - the image is created by a targeted burst of ionizing radiation. In hospitals, x-ray rooms are carefully designed to minimise radiation exposure, for instance with lead walls. Mr Thurn says that with portable systems this lack of shielding is compensated for by the greater space where they are used, be it outdoors, or in a field hospital setup. In these cases he says that healthcare workers can stand much further away. However, the issue of radiation needs to be clarified, as currently the international guidelines on radiation safety ""are designed for the traditional fixed type of X-ray"", says Zhi Zhen Qin, a digital health specialist at the Stop TB Partnership. The image quality of portable X-ray machines used to be a concern as well. But Miss Pilkington says that today's machines rival fixed units in this regard: ""The images that are taken on those machines are of a comparable diagnostic standard."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. However, there are barriers to just how small the components of an X-ray system can get. If an X-ray detector is too small to capture a body part in a single exposure, extra images might need to be taken, which would add to time burdens and radiation doses. And units with a limited battery life or data storage, reduce how many patients can be imaged in one session. Meanwhile, some systems described as portable aren't exactly lightweight and easily transported, particularly if they need other hardware to make them work like a stand or computer equipment. Yet Australian firm Micro-X is now making much lighter ultraportable x-ray machines, due to its new technology that can produce the X-rays without creating heat. This does away with the need for oil and motors for cooling, which add weight. The high cost of portable X-ray machines is also an issue. While they are cheaper than the larger fixed machines, they are still very expensive. The Stop TB Partnership says that the price of ultraportable machines ranges between $47,000 and $66,000. There are additional costs for warranties, installation and software. Dr Suvanand says that as more manufacturers enter this space, ""we hope that the competition will drive down the prices"". Ultimately, his vision for the future is that ""everybody who needs an X-ray should have access to this type of modern, digital, ultra-portable X-ray with AI capability"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Venezuelan opposition denounces 'intimidation' attempts","By Vanessa Buschschlüter",2024-01-24,"Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has denounced what she says are attempts by the government to intimidate her and her supporters. She said two campaign co-ordinators had been ""abducted"" and party offices had been vandalised. The incidents come just months after the government agreed to a deal laying the groundwork for free and fair elections to be held in 2024. Ms Machado said Tuesday's incidents violated that deal. Under the agreement, which was reached in Barbados in October last year, the government of President Nicolás Maduro committed to allowing international observers to monitor the presidential poll, which is scheduled for a yet-to-be-determined date in the second half of 2024. The 2018 election, which saw President Maduro win a second term in office, was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. As part of the Barbados deal, his government also promised to guarantee that all candidates would be able to freely and safely move throughout the country. In return, the United States, which backed the Barbados talks, eased some of the sanctions it had imposed on Venezuela's oil sector. However, just three months after the agreement was struck, tension between the opposition and the government is again on the rise. On Monday, Venezuela's Attorney-General Tarek William Saab, a close ally of President Maduro, announced that 32 people had been arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate the president and Venezuela's defence minister, Vladimir Padrino. Mr Saab also said that arrest warrants had been issued for another 14 suspects, among them human rights activist Tamara Sujú and journalist Sebastiana Barráez, who both live outside of Venezuela and have been highly critical of the government. Tension also seems to be on the rise again with the United States, with Mr Padrino claiming that the alleged plot to kill him and the president had the backing of the CIA and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The US state department said on Tuesday it was ""deeply concerned"" by Monday's arrests. ""Actions that run counter to the spirit and the letter of the Barbados Agreement will have consequences,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller warned. Meanwhile, rival groups of supporters took to the streets of the capital Caracas on Tuesday. President Maduro appeared to goad his followers when he told them, invoking independence hero Simon Bolívar: ""If the fascists ever hurt me (...), I leave it to you to do what you have to do to restore justice and peace in Venezuela. Activate the Bolivarian fury!"" Graffiti appeared later on the pavement in front of María Corina Machado's campaign headquarters reading ""Bolivarian fury"". The whereabouts of two of her campaign co-ordinators are unknown after video showed men seizing them and taking them away in unmarked cars. Ms Machado asked for help from the international community, telling them that ""we must put a stop to this madness because this is what the Bolivarian fury means: aggression, disappearances, persecution"". The 56-year-old politician overwhelmingly won an opposition primary held in October despite being banned from running for office. She has appealed against the ban, which she has always maintained was unfair and designed to keep the opposition down. Mr Maduro has not yet announced whether he will stand for re-election or if his party will put forward a different candidate. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Ukraine war: Russia hits Odesa after killing grain deal","By James Waterhouse",2023-07-24,"The Ukraine Grain Deal. 22 July 2022 - 17 July 2023. A short life, with its flaws, but the only diplomatic light in the darkness of Russia's invasion. It had allowed Ukraine to export its grain to the world through the Black Sea. A third less than normal, but still 33 million tonnes. However, in recent months, its health had deteriorated. Russia was accused of slowing the route with naval blockades and long inspections, and the deal finally succumbed. Last week saw Moscow's official withdrawal. Russia then launched a wave of missile strikes on ports it once promised to leave alone. EXPLAINED: What was the Ukraine grain deal? One site destroyed was a grain terminal owned by one of Ukraine's biggest producers, Kernel. Officials say more than 60,000 tonnes of grain has been destroyed in the past week. ""We stopped our exports for the first two to three months of the war,"" explains Yevhen Osypov, Kernel's CEO. ""The prices of oil and grain went up by 50%, and you can see the same happening again now."" While global grain supplies seem to be stable for now, global markets saw the price of grain rise by 8% within a day of Russia pulling out - the highest daily rise since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin now says his country ""is capable of replacing the Ukrainian grain both on a commercial and free-of-charge basis, especially as we expect another record harvest this year"". In an article published on the Kremlin's website ahead of this week's Russia-Africa summit, President Putin wrote that ""Russia will continue its energetic efforts to provide supplies of grain, food products, fertilisers and other goods to Africa"". Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's leading grain exporters. The Kremlin had earlier agreed not to target port infrastructure in three locations in the region, but that diplomatic shield is no more. With damaged ports, no agreed corridor through the Black Sea and Russia controlling most of the coastline, Mr Osypov believes Ukraine's grain export capacity will drop by a further 50%. ""It's a huge challenge for our farmers because they'll have to sell their products 20% below cost,"" says Mr Osypov, who predicts there will be fewer people in the future working less land. The death of the grain deal extends well beyond Odesa's ports. The city's mayor Gennady Trukhanov thinks Moscow just wants to show nothing will be exported without them, and he's right. ""The most terrible thing is that in order to achieve their goal, they've attacked innocent people,"" he says. You're left in little doubt over the scale of Ukrainian grain production when standing 40 metres high on top of a silo in the central Poltava region. The plant we're in can hold 120,000 tonnes. It's around a third full, and while Ukraine is unable to export through the Black Sea, it will keep filling up. The site is surrounded by an endless agricultural expanse. This is a country which can't suddenly stop producing grain. It has to go somewhere - or at least that's the hope. ""We feel there is a need for us to harvest as much grain as possible,"" says Yulia, a lab technician at Kernel, as she pours samples into a pipe. Before the birth of the grain deal, tens of millions of people from some of the world's poorest countries were at risk of starvation because of Ukraine's inability to export it. Twelve months later, that risk has returned. ""The Russians probably don't understand what hunger is,"" says Yulia. ""People are starving, there's a large supply, but they can't get it for no reason."" Moscow had threatened to pull out before, mainly saying there were too many restrictions on its own agricultural goods. It also wants a major bank let into a global payment system, restrictions lifted on Russian fertiliser companies, and for its ships to get full access to insurance and foreign ports. President Putin has now turned those complaints into demands. However, if they were to be met, that would require a relaxation of western sanctions, which is hard to imagine. Last July, the Kremlin had seemed keen to be ""part of the solution"" when it came to the food crisis that it has directly caused by invading Ukraine. Battlefield frustrations seem to have changed that stance. Despite the lack of a pulse, Turkey - one of the main brokers of the grain deal along with the United Nations - is still hopeful it can be resuscitated. So, assuming the initiative is indeed dead, is there an heir apparent? An alternative solution for Ukraine to export? Road and rail has been used through neighbouring countries like Romania and Poland, but there have been times when Ukrainian grain has flooded their markets and driven down prices, to the annoyance of farmers. The River Danube has also been developed as a route through central Europe, with two million tonnes of grain making it through in the last 12 months, compared with 600,000 the year before. However both scratch the surface of what Ukraine hopes to shift, and are much more expensive logistically. During her recent visit I asked the head of US Aid, Samantha Power, whether Ukraine's status as ""Europe's breadbasket"" was a thing of the past. She'd just announced a package worth almost a billion dollars for Ukraine, which included agricultural modernisation. ""We're doing what we can, but there's no substitute for peace,"" was her reply.

"Just Stop Oil: Met Police says protests have cost it £20m",NA,2023-12-07,"The Met Police has asked Just Stop Oil (JSO) to ""reach out and speak to us"" after revealing policing the campaign group's protests has cost almost £20m. The force said the time it had spent on the group equated to roughly 300 officers being taken off frontline policing each day. It added JSO had ""refused to engage"" with police when planning protests. JSO said it would continue its actions until ""steps are taken to prevent the extraction of new oil and gas"". Hundreds of protests have been held since the group's first demonstration in 2022. As well as marching on roads, JSO activists have disrupted events including The Open golf, Wimbledon, the Ashes, the London Pride March and the Chelsea Flower Show. Cdr Kyle Gordon, the senior officer responsible for planning the Met's response to the latest round of JSO's protests, said: ""£20m from the public purse is a lot of money. I would much, much prefer to be using that within communities. ""These officers should be responding to local communities and dealing with local issues instead of being taken away to police Just Stop Oil protests."" He added: ""When [JSO] talk about slow marches, it is in everything other than name an attempt to block the road and cause maximum disruption to people right across London. ""Our desire is that Just Stop Oil come forward and speak with us, so we can actually work with them. ""We absolutely understand and support the fundamental right to protest within a democratic society, but what we've got to do is balance that right with the rights of everybody else who is using this city."" A spokesperson for JSO said the group had written to Sir Mark Rowley, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, about new oil and gas licensing in October but had had no response. ""The police must know that unless steps are taken to prevent the extraction of new oil and gas, they will be on the frontlines of dealing with social breakdown and mass civil unrest,"" the spokesperson added.

"Just Stop Oil protests cost Met Police £7.7m since April","By Jess Warren & PA Media",2023-07-25,"A 13-week long campaign by Just Stop Oil (JSO) has cost the Met Police more than £7.7m, the force has revealed. The Met said the cost of policing 515 protests carried out by JSO since April has amounted to the equivalent of 23,500 officer shifts. Over that time more than 270 people were arrested over the demonstrations, which included slow marches and the disruption of high-profile events. The force called the action ""crime"", but JSO said it would continue. During the three months of JSO protests, the Met issued 420 section 12 orders to clear the city's roads. Met Assistant Commissioner Twist said: ""This isn't protest, this is crime, and there is a difference. ""The right to protest is strongly protected, but when you get into deliberately causing serious disruption, that tips over into crime,"" he told LBC. As well as marching in main roads, activists have disrupted events including The Open, Wimbledon, the Ashes, the London Pride March and the Chelsea Flower Show. The cost to the Met is on top of the £7.5m spent by the force policing JSO protest action between October and December last year.

"UK Heatwave: Tackling myths around darker skin and SPF","By Manish Pandey",2023-09-05,"If you're planning to spend some time in the sun, you'll be packing the essentials: sunglasses, hat, water bottle and… suncream? It can help protect you against the harmful rays of the sun and can reduce the risk of developing skin cancer. But not everyone thinks applying it is necessary, and that can be particularly true in some minority communities. Past global studies have found people from certain groups are less likely to use recommended protection. With heat warnings in place and parts of the UK expected to reach 32C (89.6F) this week, BBC Newsbeat looks at some of the myths behind this reluctance. Demi Colleen, 29, is a content creator who focuses on beauty and addressing misunderstandings around sunscreen for minority communities. She ""believed the myths about the UK sun not being strong enough to cause any damage"" when she was younger. ""Because I'm brown, I thought that I didn't need to apply SPF [Sun Protection Factor] to my skin,"" she says. Demi feels phrases like ""black don't crack"" - which refers to the belief black people tend not to show the effects of ageing - wrongly suggests there is enough natural protection against the sun. She admits that meant she was ""lax with SPF"" as a teenager. Tanvi Shah agrees with Demi, saying when she was younger she wouldn't wear suncream on her face. The 27-year-old influencer feels it was due to ""the lack of education and knowledge around the importance of SPF"". ""When you're south Asian - I'm Indian - there is this false assumption that because we don't get sunburnt [as often], we don't need SPF on our face."" So how much natural protection do you actually have? Dr Vanita Rattan is a skin expert and says people of colour have melanin in the skin, which does offer some natural protection. But, she adds, it's the same as an SPF rating of around seven, protection that is ""so low you wouldn't even put it in a bottle"". Tanvi says Indian households - particularly older generations - might be less trusting of over-the-counter products. She remembers being recommended a turmeric mask for her ""problematic skin"", but didn't feel it helped. And she thinks a lack of knowledge about what is ""scientifically proven"" to work can be passed on to younger family members. This was something Demi experienced in terms of sun protection, using carrot oil to encourage her skin to tan deeper. After visiting a dermatologist and researching routines and products, Demi changed her mind. ""I realised that all the myths I believed, the misconceptions about SPF, its purpose and the way it worked were just untrue,"" she says. Demi also feels marketing has played a part, and adverts have historically been ""very much targeted towards white people"". And the products themselves haven't given enough thought to the effect on diverse skin tones, she says. People have told Demi traditional products left them looking ""ghostly with a white cast"". ""Sunscreen has always been considered as a sort of white people thing,"" says Demi. ""Black and brown people are being left out of the conversation. So a lot of work needs to be done."" Dr Rattan says products have developed in the past five years, and now brands catering to different skin tones are available. ""Previously, we just didn't have very good skincare, you may be lucky to get a good moisturiser,"" she says. Price has also been raised as a possible barrier. The government in the Netherlands wanted to tackle record rates of skin cancer, so installed free suncream dispensers in schools and universities and at festivals, parks, sports venues and open public spaces across the country. In the UK, sunscreen is classified as a ""cosmetic"" product and carries a 20% tax, adding around £1.50 to the cost of a bottle. Charities in the UK have called for this to be scrapped. Tanvi and Demi agree that greater accessibility would encourage more people in the UK to use it. ""It's essentially medical usage,"" says Demi. ""It's not just for vanity or for beauty, this is protecting you for a medical reason,"" says Demi. The Department of Health says support is available for some people. ""High-factor sunscreen is on the NHS prescription list for certain conditions and is already provided VAT free when dispensed by a pharmacist to these patients.""

"Rochdale by-election: 'This is for Gaza' message resonated for many","By Marc Waddington",2024-03-01,"The only statue that stands outside Rochdale town hall isn't of a politician or philanthropist, but of Gracie Fields, the 1930s Hollywood icon who was born above a chip shop a few streets away. And if the glamour of Los Angeles was a world away from this working-class Greater Manchester town, so too was one of the key battlegrounds of the by-election that has seen George Galloway become its new MP. Alongside cost-of-living worries and the loss of local services, the conflict in Gaza was a major part of this contest. It was clear from speaking to people in the town centre that his podium declaration that ""This is for Gaza"" resonated with many here. ""I feel like people don't like Labour the way they used to,"" said 19-year-old student Mohammad Khan. ""George Galloway was [the better choice] because he supports Palestine."" The Gaza conflict wasn't the only subject of debate of course in Rochdale - local issues were also important. Independent candidate Dave Tully came second to Mr Galloway. His 6,638 votes firmly put the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Reform and the man who ended up Labour's candidate on paper only - Azhar Ali - in the shade. Mr Khan said: ""It's good that an independent candidate should come in second,"" adding that he believed more independent voices in politics was a good thing. Lesley Fawthrop, a 46-year-old office worker, also said she believed more ""down to earth, hard-working people"" were needed in politics. ""I don't know [Mr Tully] personally, but people can relate to [him],"" she said, adding that she viewed mainstream politicians as ""all as bad as each other"". But not everyone was happy about the prospect of having Mr Galloway representing their town. Elizabeth Senior, a 51-year-old office worker, said she was not impressed to have ""a man who licked milk off Rula Lenska as our MP"" - a reference to Mr Galloway's infamous appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006. ""Labour are as bad as the Tories,"" said Ms Senior, who described herself politically as being more to the right than the left. ""There's no sense the Tories made an effort here at all."" Claire Smith, 50, who is currently unemployed, said there was an appeal to ""the idea of a good local independent that people feel like they can trust"". Rochdale born and raised Mr Tully, who described himself as ""having a deep understanding of the issues facing the community"", runs a local garage. His campaigning focused heavily on local issues, pledging to reinstate the maternity ward at Rochdale Infirmary and securing the future of Rochdale AFC. Mr Tully also made the cost of living a key campaign issue and condemned ""companies making billions from families that are on the breadline"". While he is known for his stance on the Middle East, Mr Galloway's also campaigned on those issues. There is no doubt here that Mr Galloway's tactic - of effectively making this contest into a referendum on Labour's position on Gaza - worked spectacularly well. Mr Ali lost the Labour Party's support over repeating claims that Israel had allowed the 7 October Hamas attacks. Unemployed Sajid Ibrahim, 46, said that while he had voted Labour for ""25 to 30 years"", he chose not to this time. ""I look at the Gaza situation and I think we just need a bit of a change in this country,"" he said. ""I think Gaza really does matter here. And we've seen George Galloway around a lot, a lot of people have been out supporting him."" Mr Ibrahim conceded not everyone had been convinced, though. ""I spoke to a lady the other day and she was like 'I've never heard of George Galloway, I'm voting Labour all the way'."" Retired bus conductor Alan Wilcock, 74, also admitted not being familiar with the town's new MP prior to the by-election contest. ""I'd never heard of George Galloway, and have voted Labour all my life"", he said. Labour will be desperate to win Rochdale back at the general election, which is now only months away. But Mr Galloway is a seasoned politician, and will be determined to be a long-term thorn in Labour's side. Apart from Gracie Fields, Rochdale is known nationally as being the birthplace, 180 years ago, of the Co-operative Movement. Indeed a sign painted on a bridge on the way into the town centre proudly declares Rochdale to be ""the home of co-operation"". We've seen little of that during this tumultuous by-election campaign, and it can't be taken for granted that it will return. Even darling Gracie went from being a forces' sweetheart to having a bid to renew her British passport rejected in 1945 for having married an Italian film producer in Hollywood five years before. A reminder for the Labour Party - if ever it needed one right now - that what happens abroad can be decisive in determining what goes on at home. Are you in Rochdale?

"Putin warns West against sending troops to Ukraine","By Laura Gozzi",2024-02-29,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Western countries against sending troops to Ukraine. The consequences of such a decision would be ""tragic"", he said. In his annual state of the nation address, President Putin accused the West of trying to drag Russia into an arms race. At the same time, he said that Russia needed to strengthen its defences on its western border now that Sweden and Finland were joining Nato. President Putin said the West ""provoked"" the conflict in Ukraine and ""continues to lie, without any embarrassment, saying that Russia allegedly intends to attack Europe"". Probably referring to comments by French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that sending Nato ground troops to Ukraine ""could not be excluded"", President Putin said: ""The consequences for possible interventionists will be... tragic."" ""We also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory,"" he added. ""All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilisation. Don't they get that?"" Several Nato countries, including the US, Germany and the UK, ruled out deploying ground troops to Ukraine. The US has criticised the Russian president's latest remarks regarding the possibility of nuclear warfare. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said it was ""not the first time we have seen irresponsible rhetoric from Vladimir Putin"". ""It is no way for the leader of a nuclear armed state to speak,"" he said, adding that the US has seen no evidence that Moscow is planning to launch such weapons. President Putin also boasted about Russia's sophisticated weapons - like hypersonic aircraft and unmanned underwater vehicles - and said that Russia's strategic nuclear forces are in a ""state of full readiness"". Notably, President Putin explicitly referred to the two years of fighting in Ukraine as a ""war"", despite his repeated insistence that Russia's invasion should be described as a ""special military operation"". He said that an ""absolute majority"" of Russians supported his decision to invade Ukraine, and that the Russian people were now united against what he called Western attempts to weaken the country. He also hit out at accusations from the US that Russia is developing nuclear weapons for use against satellites in space. The speech came just over two weeks before Russia's presidential election, in which President Putin is widely expected to win a fifth term in office. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the address could ""to a large degree be seen as [Putin's] election programme"". Indeed, much of the address focused on domestic issues ranging from the modernisation of the tax system to pensions and incentives aimed at boosting Russia's dwindling birth rate. He also talked about the need to improve the health of the nation, announcing a series of measures aimed at boosting Russia's life expectancy, which at 70 is currently one of the lowest in Europe. Urging people to focus on physical activity and cut down alcohol consumption, he joked: ""Stop drinking and start skiing!"" The speech lasted a record two hours and was attended by all senior politicians, the CEOs of oil and gas firms Rosneft and Gazprom, as well as religious leaders of all denominations. It was broadcast on giant screens across Moscow, and several cinemas in Russian cities reportedly screened it free of charge. As expected, there was no mention of the death of Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader who died in a Siberian penal colony two weeks ago and who many saw as President Putin's greatest opponent. Navalny, who will be buried in Moscow on Friday, died under circumstances yet to be fully established on 16 February. His widow Yulia has insisted that President Putin was responsible.

"Just Stop Oil protester who delayed thousands convicted over M25 protest",NA,2024-02-19,"A Just Stop Oil protester has been convicted of causing a nuisance by climbing on to a gantry over the M25 in west London. Cressida Gethin, 22, scaled the gantry above the M25 near Heathrow Airport in July 2022 to protest the UK reaching its hottest temperature on record, 40C (104F), the day before. Those affected by delays included 4,000 airline customers, the court heard. She did not dispute scaling the gantry but denied it amounted to the charge. Speaking outside Isleworth Crown Court after the verdict, the Cambridge University music student said she did not regret the protest and would ""not back down"". As a result of the protest by the climate activist group, 3,923 British Airways customers were affected by cancellations and delays, said Edwin Hall, senior manager at British Airways, in a statement read to the court. Broadcaster and environmentalist Chris Packham told the court during the trial that he was stuck in the resulting traffic for four to five hours during a trip from Hampshire to Surrey, where he was working on a BBC programme. He told jurors he came to ""sympathise"" with the fact he was forced to think about climate change while he waited. Mr Packham later said outside the court: ""What makes a music student, aged 22, with her whole life ahead of her, do something as precarious, physically dangerous and now, potentially in terms of an impact on her life, dangerous? ""Well, I think I know the reason and I think everyone else knows the reason."" During her trial, Ms Gethin, who has taken two years out of her university studies, said she aimed to ""interrupt business as usual"" and draw media attention to the ""dire situation"" represented by the temperature in Britain. However, she said she did not realise she was so close to Heathrow Airport and did not choose the location. In her closing statement last week Gethin, who was self-represented, told the court: ""If you believed that the protest causing the delays was intended to create meaningful, positive change, would you have defined the delay as 'serious inconvenience'?"" However, Judge Hannah Duncan said ""evidence about climate change wasn't admissible or relevant"". On Friday, Judge Duncan said she believed the average person would consider the climate crisis ""far more serious"" than a nuisance, but ""that's not what they [the jury] are considering"". After the verdict, Gethin said that while pleading guilty would have given credit in her favour, she ""felt very strongly"" the need to tell the jury ""why I had done what I had done"". A jury found Gethin guilty of causing a public nuisance contrary to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, by a majority of 10 to two.

"Rochdale: Is this the most chaotic by-election ever?","By Brian Wheeler",2024-02-24,"By-elections are often colourful and chaotic but there has never been anything quite like the contest taking place in Rochdale right now. The vote next Thursday - caused by the death of the town's widely respected Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd - should have been relatively straightforward for Sir Keir Starmer's party, riding high on the back of a string of by-election victories around the country. But the entry into the race of maverick former MP and left-wing firebrand George Galloway - and the spectacular implosion of Labour's campaign - has thrown the contest wide open. Mr Galloway is mainly targeting Rochdale's Muslim population, who make up about 30% of the electorate, many of whom are angry about what is happening in Gaza. ""The people of Gaza don't have a vote in this election, you do,"" reads one of his campaign leaflets. At a meeting at the town's Kashmir Youth Project, he says that, if elected, he will ""enter the chamber of the House of Commons like a tornado"" and ""shake the walls for Gaza"". He claims a victory for him in Rochdale, a small town near Manchester, will be noticed ""by the people in Gaza, by the people in Tel Aviv, but most importantly by the front benches in Parliament."" Labour's candidate Azhar Ali, who had backed an immediate ceasefire in Gaza before Keir Starmer's calls this week for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", was disowned by the party when a recording of him making allegedly antisemitic comments emerged, for which he apologised. Labour members in the town were ordered to stop campaigning for him - and the shutters came down on the party's campaign headquarters. But Mr Ali is still officially Labour's candidate - that's how he will appear on the ballot paper this coming Thursday because it was legally too late to change. If he is elected, he will sit in the Commons as an independent MP. But it was clear from speaking to voters in the rain-lashed town centre on Tuesday evening that some Labour supporters were either not aware of him being dropped by the party or did not care. Paul Walsh, a 56-year-old roofer, said he knew all about the controversy but he was still going to vote Labour anyway. Rumours had been swirling that Mr Ali's supporters were still campaigning for him - although there was little evidence of this beyond some mocked up social media images depicting Keir Starmer as a clown. On Thursday, Mr Ali broke cover to say that these images had nothing to do with him. In a statement, he said that he had been ""a Labour supporter for more than 30 years and has Labour values"". He added that he was campaigning and standing to be Rochdale's MP and that Sir Tony was a friend and he ""wants to continue his good work"". Little wonder some voters seem confused about who to back. Wendy Fleming, who recently moved to Rochdale from Ireland, half-jokingly suggests that the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate Ravin Rodent Subortna seems to be the only one talking sense. ""That actually hurts my soul,"" she says. ""Voting is something I really do take seriously, always have done, but this time it's so difficult. It's really just going to be the best of a bad bunch."" Just about everyone you speak to is fed up with the bad press Rochdale has received in recent years. The town, in the foothills of the Pennines, has a proud history - it was the birthplace of the Cooperative movement and 1930s film legend Gracie Fields. But it has recently become associated with child sexual exploitation and grooming - something that is an issue at the ballot box, with William Howarth standing as the Parents Against Grooming UK candidate. The town centre has had a makeover, with a new shopping centre, and its Grade I listed town hall has just benefited from a £20m restoration. But social deprivation' , poor housing and crime are rife. George Galloway is eager not to be seen as a single-issue campaigner and is promising to ""make Rochdale great again"". He is calling for the local hospital's maternity ward to be re-opened - and has even promised to help save the local football club, Rochdale AFC, which is facing bankruptcy after being relegated from the Football League. Many young Muslim voters in the town have been energised by his campaign - both for its focus on Gaza and his promise to tackle the town's social ills. Area Shakeel, who is studying to be a mental health nurse and volunteers at a local soup kitchen, says: ""He's actually listened to our views and our opinions in a diverse community - you feel like you are being heard when you are speaking to him."" But the man who sees himself as Mr Galloway's main rival, the town's former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, accuses him of ignoring the majority of voters in the town, who, he says, are ""white, working people"". Mr Danczuk, who was suspended by the Labour Party in 2015 for sending explicit messages to a 17-year-old girl, something he now dismisses as ""tabloid nonsense"", is standing for Reform UK. He insists his ""old Labour values"" are perfectly in tune with Reform - normally seen as being to the right of the Tory Party. He says he voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but ""only just"" so has no problem with being the candidate for the former Brexit Party. He says his focus is ""100% on Rochdale"", tackling crime and taking a hard line on immigration. ""What we have seen over time is places like Rochdale, a proud Lancashire town, its culture and ethos diluted by ridiculous amounts of asylum seekers being placed here,"" he says. Mr Danczuk says he and Mr Galloway, both former Labour MPs, have shared platforms in the past. But those days are long gone. ""He's a chancer, a grifter,"" says Mr Danczuk, who highlights the former Respect MP's record of standing for election - in some cases with great success - in areas with large Muslim populations. ""He's gone from Bradford to Tower Hamlets, now he's showing up in Rochdale. He should take his daft hat, his fat cigars and his extremist policies back to wherever he comes from."" Mr Galloway initially says he won't dignify this with a response, but can't resist a jibe of his own. ""Being called a chancer by Simon Danczuk - it's a bit like being told to stand up straight by the Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" he says. After being expelled from Labour in 2003 over his stance on the Iraq war, he has defeated Labour in Bethnal Green, in east London, for the anti-war Respect Party and - in one of the biggest by-election upsets of recent times - in Bradford West, in 2012. He says he wants to use Rochdale as a launchpad for his Workers Party of Britain, which is trying to recruit 50 candidates to send a message to Keir Starmer at the general election. Andrew Johnson, a 62-year-old housing campaigner, says he is worried about ""sectarianism"" if Galloway is elected and is voting Reform because it ""would be inappropriate, I think, to vote someone who is more concerned about things that are going on thousands of miles away than streets away"". But Samur Mushtaq, a local restaurant owner and community campaigner, says he has been alarmed by the ""inflammatory rhetoric"" from the Danczuk campaign. ""Personally, I just want a local MP who is going to represent the community well,"" he says, adding that he is ""veering towards the Liberal Democrats"". Rochdale was a Lib Dem stronghold not so long ago and the party's candidate Iain Donaldson believes it can be again. He backs a ceasefire in Gaza and an eventual ""two-state solution"" in the Middle East but is focusing his campaign on tackling ""child poverty and poor quality housing"" in Rochdale, among other local issues. The Conservatives also have a strong following in the constituency, particularly in the more affluent suburbs and villages. They came second at the 2019 general election, with 14,000 votes. The Tory candidate, Paul Ellison, who runs a landscaping firm, is also campaigning on ""bread and butter"" issues like crime and local businesses. He was on holiday when we were in Rochdale, but James Daly, MP for nearby Bury North, insisted the party was ""fighting for every vote"". Roy Smethurst, out walking his dog Sunny in the pouring rain in Littleborough, a village just outside Rochdale, says he will be voting Conservative. ""I used to be proud to be a Rochdalian,"" he says, adding: ""It's just not the same town I was brought up in or it doesn't seem to be to me."" He is no fan of George Galloway and his focus on Gaza. ""We are not going to influence what happens in the Middle East. It's just not going to happen."" Another twist, in an already tortuous by-election comes courtesy of the Green Party, which disowned its candidate Guy Otten over old social media posts about the Muslim faith and the conflict in Gaza. The Greens are now campaigning for independent candidate Mark Coleman, a retired vicar and Just Stop Oil activist who has previously been jailed for non-violent direct action. Mr Coleman says his message is going over well with voters but cheerfully admits that he faces a court appearance in London just before polling day over his latest conviction. He says he hopes to avoid a jail sentence this time, after pleading guilty, so he can make it back to Rochdale for the count on Thursday. It's enough to make your head spin. One thing that appears to unite everyone in Rochdale is a sense that the town has been neglected and let down by politicians. Among the 11 candidates standing in the by-election are two local businessmen, David Tully and Michael Howarth. Neither have any political experience but both say they feel compelled to make a stand. Aqub Nazir, who runs youth project Aspire2Inspire, says the rise of independent candidates - and the number of people getting involved in community projects across the town - is a positive sign that people are willing to work for change. ""There is a massive demand now for someone locally to stand up who is actually going to care for Rochdale as a community,"" he says. ""I don't like to say it, but it's one of the most deprived areas in the whole of the United Kingdom so who is actually going to be doing work on the ground in Rochdale?"" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Clare Rewcastle Brown: UK journalist says Malaysia sentence is 'political revenge'","By Leisha Chi-Santorelli",2024-02-11,"UK journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown has accused Malaysia of seeking ""political revenge"" for her reporting after a court jailed her in absentia. The 64-year-old is appealing a surprise conviction for criminal defamation of a Malaysian royal handed down this week. A local magistrates' court sentenced her to two years in prison during a single-day hearing. Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC she was being targeted after her work on the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal. The scandal saw $4.5bn (£3.9bn) stolen from the Malaysian sovereign fund founded by former Prime Minister Najib Razak in what is thought to be the world's largest kleptocracy case. It ensnared top Hollywood celebrities, brought down bankers from Goldman Sachs and saw the first criminal charges filed against the storied Wall Street firm. Najib was jailed in 2022 but still faces a raft of other charges. He denies all wrongdoing. On Wednesday the Kuala Terengganu Magistrates' Court ruled that Ms Rewcastle Brown had criminally defamed Malaysia's former Queen Nur Zahirah in her book The Sarawak Report - The Inside Story of the 1MDB Expose. Ms Rewcastle Brown said she was not notified in advance nor given the opportunity to defend herself in court. Her lawyers have already requested the ruling be set aside by a higher court on violations of the criminal procedure code. ""I'm afraid this is malicious, it is politically motivated. And I see it as revenge for my public interest journalism,"" she told the BBC.""I think there are a lot of very powerful and wealthy people in Malaysia who are revengeful that I identified the corruption of their former prime minister [Najib Razak], who remains popular and powerful and wealthy. ""And I think that it's no coincidence that just two or three days after [he] failed to get a pardon from the [Malaysian] King that would have let him out of jail after a fraction of his sentence, that this sentence was then passed against me"". The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) described the decision to jail Rewcastle Brown as ""outrageous"" and has called on Malaysia to scrap the sentence and to ""stop harassing the journalist over her crucial reporting on the country's 1MDB scandal, recognized as one of the world's biggest-ever corruption cases"". ""The harsh ruling will deter all reporters from investigating official corruption in Malaysia and represents a clear and present danger to press freedom in the country,"" CPJ's senior Southeast Asia representative Shawn Crispin said in a statement issued on Friday. Malaysia has the world's only rotating constitutional monarchy. The federal head of state changes every five years in what is a largely ceremonial role but the monarch wields significant cultural and political influence. The oil-rich coastal state of Terengganu is home to one of the country's nine royal families. The Malay ruler is called a Sultan and his wife, a Sultanah. Terrangganu Sultanah Nur Zahirah, who served as Malaysia's Queen from 2006-2011, has filed two defamation cases against Ms Rewcastle Brown for allegedly insinuating she was involved in corrupt practices linked to 1MDB. The first was a civil case in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur which was dismissed by the High Court in October 2022. That was overturned on appeal and is still making its way through the courts. The second filing was the case in her local magistrates court which she has won. Ms Rewcastle Brown said there was a misidentification error in the book that was corrected back in 2018. She also apologised for the error. But her legal team have argued that the error is not defamation, nor criminal libel. ""I do fear that there has been manipulation of this case and I do not seek to lay blame for that at the feet of the Sultanah. She was understandably annoyed,"" Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC. Sultanah Nur Zahirah and her legal team have been approached for comment by the BBC. The former leader is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence that was halved this week by Malaysia's pardons board - a move that sends a message leaders in South East Asia can act with impunity, said James Chin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania. Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which previously led the ruling coalition that governed Malaysia, has been pushing for a royal pardon after testing and exhausting other legal avenues of appeal. Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC she finds it hard to believe Najib's reduced sentence and her defamation conviction, which took place shortly afterward, are not linked. ""I have become somewhat emblematic in the eyes of those who are deeply resentful that Najib was found guilty and convicted of this crime. ""We can speculate, but I think that it's hard to come to the conclusion other than it is all connected to this 1MDB case"". Najib's lawyers are reportedly also trying to get Netflix documentary Man On The Run about the 1MDB scandal taken down for ""sub judicial and contemptuous"" content. He is also said to be looking to take legal action against former Malaysian attorney-general Tommy Thomas and Rewcastle-Brown over their statements in the documentary Man On The Run. A Netflix spokesperson said they wouldn't be commenting on the matter. Ms Rewcastle Brown also fears the Terengganu magistrates court ruling may impact her ability to travel freely. Malaysian law enforcement officials have twice before applied for an Interpol Red Notice for Rewcastle Brown on charges related to her 1MDB reporting. Interpol denied the previous two applications, she said. It is unclear whether Malaysian authorities will pursue an Interpol Red Notice for Rewcastle Brown's arrest again. The Kuala Terengganu Magistrates' Court did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment. Ms Rewcastle Brown is requesting support from the UK government and various non-governmental organisations such as the CPJ and Index on Censorship. Born in Sarawak, Ms Rewcastle Brown has two grown sons with husband Andrew Brown, a media strategist and former journalist who is the younger brother of former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. She founded investigative website Sarawak Report in 2010, which made her name as a journalist and environmental campaigner focused on corruption in the lucrative palm oil trade. She hopes to one day return to Malaysia without the threat of imprisonment. ""I will just keep going,"" she said. ""I'm just one of many, many journalists campaigning to support the right of journalists to do their job, which is to bring information in the public interest to the wider audience.""

"Trinidad and Tobago hit by mystery ship oil spill","By Jaroslav Lukiv & Leonardo Rocha",2024-02-11,"Trinidad and Tobago is considering declaring a national emergency over a huge oil spill from a ship that ran aground and overturned this week. At least 15km (nine miles) of Tobago's south-western coast have been affected, including some of the Caribbean island's pristine beaches. Some 1,000 volunteers have now joined government staff to clean up the spill. Divers have been trying to isolate the leak from the vessel, which was abandoned by its crew. Farley Augustine, the chief secretary of the island of Tobago, on Saturday said the government may designate the accident a Level 3 disaster, the highest. ""Everything indicates that we are going in that direction,"" he was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. The spill is currently Level 2, meaning the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management believes that the country can deal with the spill. A national emergency is declared when local resources become ""overwhelmed"" and international assistance is needed. The ship - identified only as The Gulfstream - capsized last Wednesday off the coast of the Cove Eco-Industrial Estate. No emergency calls were made.

"Gregg Wallace and the celebrities who have overshared their daily routines","By Yasmin Rufo",2024-02-10,"Masterchef judge Gregg Wallace went viral this week after he shared his typical Saturday routine. He's not the first celebrity to reveal more about his inner life than he may have intended. There is a fascination in what celebrities get up to when they're off duty, and occasionally one will oblige by sharing details of a typical 24 hours. But sitting down to write a ""day in the life"" piece is no easy feat. How honest is too honest? Should you mention your diva-esque daily habits? Do your hobbies make you sound too sanctimonious? The gregarious Wallace is the latest to have a go, setting out his hour-by-hour routine in The Telegraph. The 59-year-old wakes at 05:00 and reads for an hour before checking the sign-up numbers for his health programme. Then it's a trip to the gym, which lets him in early to have the pool and sauna to himself. All that exercise means he has ""less than 18 per cent body fat and a six-pack"". He also manages to fit in ""journaling, manifesting, goal-setting and reading self-help books"" into his routine. Breakfast with his PA is at 10am at the local Harvester pub, and only two hours later he is back home for lunch that his wife has ""ready on the table"". He then spends 90 minutes in the afternoon with his four-year-old non-verbal autistic son, before playing strategy computer games for ""two hours by myself in my home office"". These afternoon activities would not raise many eyebrows if he had not admitted: ""I'm a much better father now I'm older although another child isn't something I would have chosen at my age. I was always very honest with Anna, but it's what she wanted and I love her."" Perhaps a weekend newspaper supplement was not the best place to confess to this. ""It's possible that Gregg Wallace will never stop trending,"" one person wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The Times columnist Caitlin Moran invoked comedian Steve Coogan's pompous presenter Alan Partridge. ""The general consensus seemed to be 'This is the most Alan Partridge-esque life not actually lived by Alan Partridge',"" she wrote. Wallace's routine was ""hilariously bananas"", the Guardian's Michael Hogan declared on Tuesday. ""The man has zero self-awareness and a skin as thick as his manifesting journal. Right now, the Greggster probably thinks his interview has gone viral because it's an inspirational piece of lifestyle content."" However, Wallace later admitted he had been wounded by the ""cruel"" reaction, particularly to his candid comments about his family. ""People said, 'So you spend an hour and a half with your son, but then spend two hours on your computer',"" Wallace said on Instagram. ""No. I'm with my son in the house all the time. I just didn't write down, 'Had a tickle with Sid, playing around the living room.' You're not logging every minute of the day. I just logged the blocks."" He added: ""So it didn't mean that's all I saw [of] him that day. If you're living in a house with someone, you're interacting with them all the time. ""Not only that - that is a snapshot of one Saturday. And the other thing as well - and I'm almost going to cry over this - people saying that Sid was unwanted. It took us two years to conceive with Sid. Two years."" The reaction didn't stop Wallace going on to give a snapshot of another day, posting his schedule for Friday on Instagram. It included treadmill at 05:15, an Insta live at 07:00, a ""chat wiv guru"" at 07:30, then a full day's filming with a break for ""30 min read & 20 min nap"". Wallace is not the only celebrity to go viral for their daily routines. In 2021, Pirates of the Caribbean actor Orlando Bloom was the focus when he told the Sunday Times: ""I like to earn my breakfast so I'll just have some green powders that I mix with brain octane oil, a collagen powder for my hair and nails, and some protein."" He added that he was 90% plant-based, prompting him to tell readers: ""I sometimes look at a cow and think, that's the most beautiful thing ever."" Bloom is certainly a hard-working actor, telling the paper he spent ""a lot of time dreaming about roles for myself and others - for minorities and women"". He was ""trying to be a voice for everybody"". The list of impressively bonkers daily routines is lengthy - US actor Mark Wahlberg revealed in 2018 that he woke up at 02.30 before prayers, workout, golf, ""cryo chamber recovery"" and two breakfasts, all before some people have got out of bed. He was more energetic than the late Princess Margaret, who apparently wouldn't leave her bedroom until 12.30, when she would sit down for a four-course lunch with the Queen Mother. And singer Barbra Streisand has spoken about spending between 06:30 and 13:00 trading on the stock market. Despite the risks of appearing faintly ridiculous, celebrities also want to come across as interesting and real. PR expert Anna Berman tells the BBC: ""Even with media training, celebrities will have their own opinions and quirks, which PRs don't want to totally erase, or an interview might be a bit robotic and inauthentic."" She adds that her role is to ""give pointers as to whether something might be perceived as out of touch"", but it's important to remember that ""anything a celebrity says is likely to be seen as out of touch, as they are literally living a lifestyle that isn't normal"". ""It really comes down to whether the celebrity wants a reputation as a relatable person, or they're happy to publicly own and admit their privilege."" Speaking about Wallace's article, Berman says he probably wanted to ""give unique answers but it came off a bit strange"". He may even have wanted the attention to some degree. ""I don't think a publicist would sign off on something like this unless it was on purpose. Maybe he is about to announce something big and wanted to raise a profile."" Our fascination with stars' private lives, according to Berman, is the unknown. ""Most details we have of celebrities are the more glamorous elements of their life like film premieres and holidays that they post on social media, but the day-to-day remains a mystery to us."" Not every celebrity's typical day is filled with excitement. Actor Tom Hollander's day in the life was deliberately mundane and deadpan. The Bafta-winning actor told The Sunday Times in 2020 that he woke around 03:00 or 04:00. But unlike other Hollywood A-listers, he wakes early because he needs to ""pee"". Remarking that ""life has not been as busy as it used to be"", he said he spent his mornings examining his bald patch, weighing himself and pulling his stomach in. He also took a nap, ate too much lunch and listened to BBC Radio 4's The World at One to ""hear politicians lying or reports of the world ending"". We were given a further insight into his afternoon activities. ""If it's sunny I might go for a cycle ride down the canal, if it's raining I might masturbate and doze."" Sometimes there really is such a thing as too much information, even about celebrities' lives. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"War memorial protesters could face jail under new law","By Chas Geiger",2024-02-08,"Protesters who climb on to war memorials could face up to three months in jail under new laws put forward by the government. Security minister Tom Tugendhat told MPs people who scaled national monuments could also be fined £1,000. Protesters could be arrested for covering their face to try to hide their identity, or for carrying flares or other fireworks. ""Desecrating"" national memorials would not be tolerated, Mr Tugendhat said. War memorials were ""the altars of our national grief"" and the government would not stand by while they were ""disrespected in this way"", he told the Commons. Such actions were ""an assault on the memories of so many who have given their lives for our freedom and to defend our nation"" and went ""beyond the legitimate exercise of free speech"", he added. Campaigners have described the measures, which will apply in England and Wales, as a ""threat to everybody's right to protest"". But Mr Tugendhat announced that, while the UK had a ""proud tradition of peaceful protest"" and the right to protest was ""fundamental to our democracy"", that right would be removed as a reasonable excuse for ""disruptive"" offences such as blocking roads. Labour's shadow security minister Dan Jarvis said his party would scrutinise the proposals to ensure any new measures were applied ""appropriately and proportionately"". He argued that when the ""right to legitimate, peaceful protest"" was ""abused to intimidate, harass and harm others"", safeguards must be put in place to protect the public and enable the police to maintain order. But he warned there might sometimes be legitimate reasons for protesters to wear face coverings, such as ""dissidents opposing oppressive regimes"" outside foreign embassies who wanted to conceal their identity to protect their families from harm. Mr Tugendhat assured MPs that ordering the removal of a face covering would be at the police's discretion. SNP frontbencher Amy Callaghan said her party would oppose ministers ""clamping down on the right to protest"". She accused the government of ""pandering to its far-right wing"". Police already have the power to ask people to remove face coverings at designated protests where forces believe crimes are likely to occur. But the new offence will allow police to arrest protesters who disregard their orders, and those who flout the rules could face a month behind bars and a £1,000 fine. The possession of flares, fireworks and any other pyrotechnics - which Mr Tugendhat said had recently been fired at police officers - at protests would be outlawed, with offenders also facing a £1,000 fine. BJ Harrington, the chief constable of Essex Police, who leads the National Police Chiefs' Council's work on public order, said the plans would give officers the powers they needed to ""get the balance right between the rights of those who wish to protest, and those impacted by them"". The use of flares and pyrotechnics at protests was ""rare"" but ""still extremely dangerous"", he said, adding: ""Safety is our number one concern when policing these events."" Mr Harrington insisted police were not ""anti-protest"", but argued there was a difference between protest and ""activists who deliberately disrupt people's lives with reckless and criminal acts"". Akiko Hart, director of human rights group Liberty, condemned the new measures as a ""massive overreach by the Government and a threat to everybody's right to protest"". ""This is an outrageous attempt to clamp down on our fundamental right to stand up for what we believe in. ""Bringing in these powers put people at greater risk of being criminalised for exercising their right to protest - including disabled people, who in some situations have only felt comfortable protesting in public when wearing face coverings,"" she said. The proposals will be added to the Criminal Justice Bill currently being considered by Parliament. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Peter Oloya - the Ugandan LRA child soldier who moulded a new future in art","By Penny Dale",2024-02-11,"The joy former child soldier Peter Oloya finds in sculpture was first sparked while hunting for clay with his grandmother in northern Uganda - an area that became infamous for the terrifying raids led by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebel group. ""My grandmother showed me where clay is, what type of clay to be used and why,"" says the Ugandan artist, who grew up in the village of Lemo Bongolewic in the district of Kitgum. This was in the early 1980s before much of the population was herded into camps to save them from the attacks and abductions. Oloya and his late grandmother, Helen Atoo Ocula, would often follow grazing cows as they made a beeline for moist spots under groves of certain large trees. There was a particular clay called ""punu"" in Oloya's Acholi language. It was adored by the cows for its minerals - and by Oloya's grandmother because it was perfect for the pots she made for cooking and to store water. A young Oloya was mesmerised and inspired by how his grandmother's hands transformed the clay into beautiful pots. He was especially enthralled by the designs she made on the pots using small tools. ""It was only much later when I turned to art as a profession that I realised how artistic she was,"" he says. Oloya is now one of Uganda's best-known sculptors - and a leading sculpture gallery in London is hosting an exhibition of his work this month. He is also respected because he survived the horrors of being kidnapped as a child by the LRA, led by Joseph Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The artist is most famous for his Crowned Crane, a bronze sculpture of the national bird and a gift in 2007 from Uganda to the late British monarch Queen Elizabeth II. Among African football fans, he is also well-known for making the coveted trophy for the BBC's African Footballer of the Year award, for a decade from 2009. Oloya currently paints and works mostly in bronze, marble and wood - but his artistic roots lie in the clay he collected with his grandmother from riverbeds in a valley near his village home. ""Pottery is very sculptural, and clay has been part of me since childhood,"" Oloya tells the BBC. As a child, Oloya was sometimes mocked for making pottery with his grandmother - because it is seen by his Acholi culture as an occupation for girls and women. But Oloya could not resist walking by an anthill without scooping some of the fresh, soft clay from it and creating a ball for a slingshot or something else from it. ""Whenever I see it, I intuitively pick up clay and try to make something out of it - for fun, for entertainment,"" he says. His first sculpture came out another of his passions - listening to the radio. His father, a police officer based in the capital, Kampala, had sent one home. It had lights on it, which turned from green to yellow to red depending on the volume. ""I loved it so much and, as a child, I used to wonder how little people got in there to talk,"" Oloya says. He modelled a radio out of clay, digging out little holes for the indicator lights. He filled them with fireflies, which glow in the dark. But his childhood was marred by years of conflict in northern Uganda, as government forces battled the LRA fighters, who are notorious for killings, raping and abducting children to be either fighters or sex slaves. Like hundreds of thousands of people, Oloya was forced out of his home into an internally displaced camp (IDP) set up by the government. And then, when he was 11, he was abducted by the LRA when his family had ventured back to their garden to harvest sesame seeds to make into a nutritious paste as there were not enough food rations in the camp. He was beaten up, separated from his mother and with other captive boys taken deep into the bush. They kept moving around to avoid government troops, the rebels forcing their captives to become boy soldiers. During that time, Oloya turned to his beloved clay as therapy to ease the horrors he was facing - something he still finds hard to talk about. He would dig out clumps of clay from the many termite mounds that littered the bush where he was being held. ""I suddenly realised I was doing art, even there in the bush,"" he says. For months he thought his mother was dead until a new abductee told him that she was alive - and that is when he decided he needed to get away. Oloya managed to escape after 18 months. And art became his refuge. In 2004, he graduated from Makerere School of Fine Art - paying his way by DJing at night and selling toys that he had been making since he was a child. Oloya believes in the power of art to change people's lives. After graduating from art school, he returned to the IDP camps in northern Uganda to give art lessons, nurture talent and also put on exhibitions in Kampala. Profits from any art sales were shared out. The camps are now closed and people in northern Uganda have been able to return home. But his community-based organisation still operates - and he is setting up a museum of Acholi art and culture in his village. For his first international solo exhibition at London's Pangolin Gallery, Oloya has created a new body of work that focuses once again on themes that most interest him: the concept of beauty, the play between modernity and culture, and the environment and climate. Fault is a bronze piece made from the impression of cracked earth. Unless you look carefully, you might miss the small, flailing human figure that has fallen into one of the cracks - or fault lines. Oloya's message is blunt: ""Climate change, global warming - it's our fault and it's killing us."" A companion piece is a bronze sculpture of a crying child. It offers more hope - because the child is also clutching a green seedling in one hand. ""We have to stop thinking of the planet as Mother Earth, which is there to just provide for us,"" Oloya says. ""Instead, we need to think of the planet as a distressed child, who is asking to be carried, who is asking for our help."" Another striking piece - which is different to his usual work - is a woman's traditional dress that Oloya has made from bark cloth. Attached to the bodice are old mobile phone keyboards. Oloya uses them as symbols of modernity and plastic waste from outside Africa, which contrast vividly with the organic bark cloth that comes from inside the continent. ""Much of our environment in Africa is not made in Africa. It is brought in and is rotting in Africa,"" says the artist. ""But I put the dead phones on the dress to give people hope - we can recycle things, we can reuse things."" Oloya also explores the theme of modernity in a series of different sized and shaped gourds, the woody fruit of the calabash trees. He has burnt on to the surface of the gourds African decorative patterns. At first glance they look like the calabash used in many villages to store milk, oil or water. But on closer inspection, you can also see the logos of the giant global corporations that now dominate the drinks market in most African countries. ""I love art,"" Oloya says ""because it's given me another language - to spark conversations."" The exhibition Peter Oloya: A Journey from Adversity to Artistry is on at Pangolin London, King's Cross, until 2 March 2024.

"Crime to buses: Wellingborough by-election in charts","By Ben Schofield",2024-02-12,"Voters in Wellingborough will choose a new MP in a by-election on February 15. It is taking place because the former Conservative MP Peter Bone was removed from his role after more than one in 10 registered constituents signed a recall petition. The seat, in the heart of Northamptonshire, includes about 80,000 voters. It was once a centre of footwear manufacturing but its economy has diversified to include services and logistics. But what can data show us about some of the issues facing the constituency? And what do some of the candidates think? These figures are for ""selected"" offences involving ""knives or sharp instruments"". The offences range from actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm to robbery, rape and homicide. They show that between March 2014 and March 2023, the number of those offences in Northamptonshire increased by 70%, but there has been a decline from a peak in 2021. More recent data suggests that the decline is continuing. Gen Kitchen, Labour, said ""knife crime's definitely a problem"" and that she had spoken to parents anxious about children coming home from school. But she praised the ""great work of the third sector [the voluntary sector] and local charities"" and credited them with bringing numbers down through outreach in schools and knife amnesty bins. Former police officer Ana Savage Gunn, Liberal Democrats, also praised ""superb works"" by community groups. She said the government had ""underfunded the police"" but ""when the crime figures went through the roof, thought better of it"". Home Office data shows the number of police officers per 100,000 in Northamptonshire fell by almost 20% between 2010 and 2019, but by March 2023 had almost recovered. Ms Savage Gunn said the police service was now ""unstructured"" and had ""lost a lot of experienced officers – you can't just open a box of police officers, you have to train them"". Helen Harrison, Conservative, said it ""was absolutely right that we reversed the cuts to the police force"". Several residential estates, she added, had benefitted from the Safer Streets Fund, which paid for CCTV, more secure front doors, and alley gates. If elected she would ""plead"" with the county's Police and Crime Commissioner to bring ""visible policing"" to the streets, with officers ""out of their cars patrolling"". Reform UK's Ben Habib said the country faces a ""massive uphill struggle"" with crime because ""the finely balanced equation that gives criminals the confidence of knowing that they will be apprehended and banged to rights"" was ""broken"". He added the economy should be the priority: ""When people can't afford to make ends meet then of course people are going to turn to crime."" For Will Morris, Green Party, crime is a ""complex problem"" needing a ""complex solution"". ""This isn't just about the police, it's about childcare agencies, about the medical services and the mental health services,"" he said. Marion Turner-Hawes, Independent, said Wellingborough had ""deep challenges"" with crime, ""particularly drug issues"". More than half of a ""network of community support"" had ""disappeared overnight"" and ""young people have lost out as a result"". ""I am not saying that excuses everybody picking up a knife. But we have to understand the context that if energy doesn't go in one direction, it goes in another direction,"" she said. North Northamptonshire Council said these figures for 2023 were lower than expected and there could be an issue with how the data was split since Northamptonshire's councils structure changed in 2021. ""If you look at the bus routes that we have in Wellingborough, it's kind of not a surprise,"" Ms Kitchen said, ""because there kind of aren't any."" She added some ""really common-sense routes"" had ""been cut"", meaning ""less connectivity"". Ms Harrison accepted ""we don't have a huge history of great public transport in North Northamptonshire"", though she supports buses to help people get around and ""fulfil environmental commitments"". The Conservative-led council had a ""bus service improvement plan"" which she hoped ""would start to see increased uptake in bus use"". ""The only way you change people's habits is if you had a really, really good, very regular bus service going all over the place, so that people would actually, genuinely ditch their cars."" She called for more data to see ""who wants the buses, who's going to use the buses, where they're going to be best used"", then they could ""lobby government for more money"". Mr Morris said a 4.5-year difference in life expectancy between Queensway and a neighbouring area around Gleneagles Drivewas ""shocking"". One problem, he said, was the ""attitude"" of the present government to the ""nanny state"". ""Anything that might improve people's lives or anything that might improve health is smacked down because it's 'woke' or you shouldn't interfere with people's lives."" Mr Habib agreed that it is ""absolutely something that needs to be tackled"". The best way? ""You need a healthy economy,"" he said. ""If you're prosperous as an individual, you're able to make better life choices."" Ms Harrison said public health and ""reducing health inequalities"" was something she took ""very seriously"". She said some government schemes are ""sticking plaster stuff"", though she praised the cost of living payments, the Household Support Fund, and increase in National Living Wage. The key was ""catching people before they fall"". ""If we're not catching the problems further upstream, then we're going to have to continue to find ways to help people when they're already in trouble."" Ms Kitchen said a Labour government would ""shift more care into the community"" and train more doctors and nurses. She criticised the Conservatives for ""not properly funding public services"". ""Queensway probably relies more on those services… and they have just seen it cut and cut and cut."" Mrs Turner-Hawes said ""we need a way of making sure that we've got some core, basic, good quality support and services"". Retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient would create skilled jobs she said, as well as improving living conditions, providing ""an opportunity for a real, grassroots green revolution"". Ms Savage Gunn said services were ""collapsing around everybody's ears"" and ""there's a lot of anger around"". Education was part of the solution, alongside ""making their community more vibrant"". How would she fund investment? ""A windfall tax on oil companies"" and ""shifting some of the money in society"", she said. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook and Instagram.

"Students in court after Exeter graduation protest",NA,2023-07-18,"Two University of Exeter students have appeared in court after a protest at a graduation ceremony. Edred Whittingham, 25, from Norwich, was charged with two counts of criminal damage and breach of bail conditions. Kostja Junglas, 27, from Oxford, was charged with breaching bail conditions. The protest took place just after 13:00 BST on Monday and was later claimed to be action by British environmental activist group Just Stop Oil. At Exeter Magistrates' Court Mr Whittingham was remanded in custody after denying two charges of criminal damage but admitted breaching bail conditions. Ms Junglas was re-bailed after an earlier bail expired and is due to appear in court in London in August. Mr Whittingham was arrested after orange paint was allegedly sprayed from a fire extinguisher on steps at the university, district judge Stuart Smith heard. He pleaded not guilty to causing criminal damage to a concrete floor during the ceremony. He also denied damaging the clothing and boots of a security guard to the value of £221. But he admitted breaching a bail condition which banned him from possessing a device that could discharge paint. He is due in court later this week and a trial date has been set for August.

"Just Stop Oil: Chris Packham speaks out against protesters' jail terms","By Matt Knight",2023-08-02,"Naturalist Chris Packham said the ""inconvenience"" of traffic jam disruption needed to be put in perspective after two Just Stop Oil activists lost their High Court appeal. Morgan Trowland, 40, and Marcus Decker, 34, were convicted of causing a public nuisance for scaling the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in October. Judges said their jail terms - of three years and two years and seven months respectively - were ""not excessive"". Packham said the sentences were wrong. ""This does seem to be a particularly onerous and vindictive punishment and we see far lesser sentences handed out to crimes that most people would think would be far more dangerous. ""Just Stop Oil don't hurt people. They are scattering paint and litter and so on but there are no human victims of that,"" the broadcaster told BBC Essex. Packham, who visited Decker in prison, said those in the Just Stop Oil movement were ""terrified"" at the climate crisis and urged the public to keep things in perspective. ""Our temperature has now got to the point where our planet is boiling, that's the term that's been used by the UN secretary general [Antonio] Guterres. ""People are losing their lives, they're losing their livelihoods all over the world and the inconvenience faced in a traffic jam, albeit significant if you do miss those funerals, we need to keep a perspective between that and what's going on in other parts of the world and what is likely to be going on here very, very soon,"" he said. Trowland, of Islington in north London, and Decker, of no fixed address, climbed the bridge's cables at about 04:00 BST on 17 October and were eventually brought down using a cherry picker crane at about 17:30 the following day. They were found guilty of causing public nuisance by a jury at Basildon Crown Court in April. The protesters' lawyers made a bid to challenge the ""extraordinary length"" of their sentences. But Lady Justice Sue Carr, sitting with Mrs Justice Johanna Cutts and Mrs Justice Justine Thornton, said: ""Whilst the protest was non-violent as such, it had extreme consequences for many, many members of the public."" Laura O'Brien, Decker's lawyer from Hodge Jones and Allen, said they were ""shocked and saddened"" at the appeal rejection and were considering their options going forward.

"UK could be starved of energy, says North Sea boss","By Oliver Smith & Simon Jack",2023-06-27,"The UK is at risk of being ""starved"" of North Sea energy leaving it reliant on imports, a major oil and gas producer has told the BBC. Ithaca Energy said Labour's pledge to ban new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea and current taxation policy was ""spooking"" investors. Ithaca is almost entirely invested in North Sea oil and gas. Environmental groups and scientists say new oil and gas fields would take the UK over its carbon budget limits. Last week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government would not grant licences to explore new fields in the North Sea, saying it would be an ""historic mistake"" to wait until UK oil and gas runs out. But Gilad Myerson, executive chairman of Ithaca, said the move would threaten the UK's energy security. ""By a new government imagining they'll be able to stop licences and oil development in the UK, ultimately what that means is that they'll be starving the UK of energy, and it will become very dependent on energy from abroad,"" he said. North Sea oil and gas is traded on international markets and the prices are set globally, but Mr Myerson insists much of it is used domestically, and it therefore has a lower carbon footprint than energy imported from abroad. ""Most of the hydrocarbons in the UK are developed and are produced for the UK market. Some of the oil will go to refineries abroad, but will ultimately make its way back to the UK,"" he said. A Labour spokesperson said that while the party would not issue any new licences, it would ""continue to use existing fields in the North Sea for decades to come"". ""The best way to bring down bills, increase our security and sovereignty, and create good jobs is to get on with a sprint for clean energy and we welcome all businesses being part of that."" Ithaca, which has stakes in six of the 10 largest oil and gas fields in the North Sea, is also worried about the current government's approach to taxation. Last May, the government introduced a windfall tax on energy company profits, known as the Energy Profits Levy. It was set at 25%, but was later increased to 35% in the Autumn Statement, taking the overall tax rate on companies in the sector to 75%. Earlier this month, the Treasury announced the windfall tax would stay in place until 2028 but would be scrapped if oil and gas prices fell closer to historical levels for a sustained period. But Mr Myerson said the chances of oil and gas prices falling sufficiently to trigger the elimination of the tax were ""extremely low"" as supply and demand had changed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""At the moment, the taxation regime is changing constantly and it's very difficult to invest huge amounts of capital when you don't know what type of return you'll be getting,"" Mr Myerson said, adding that Ithaca was considering investing elsewhere in Europe and the US, whom he said were ""more supportive"" to oil and gas. He said the company was still committed to investing in two of the biggest undeveloped oil fields in the North Sea, the controversial Cambo and Rosebank fields. Rosebank has the potential to produce 500 million barrels of oil, and could be approved by the government within weeks. But he said they would only be developed if it made financial sense, and said political announcements from all sides had been unhelpful. ""Politicians keep making statements which spook investors. ""They are saying they do want hydrocarbons, then they say that they don't want hydrocarbons. When it comes to a project like Cambo and Rosebank, you need to make sure that the environment is stable because this is a project that will last for 10 years."" A spokesperson for the Treasury said it was ""right that we recover excess profits resulting from Putin's war"" and that the money raised from the windfall tax had been used to help people with their energy bills. ""But we also want the oil and gas sector to invest in British jobs and our energy security. That's why our new Energy Security Investment Mechanism is designed to give investors the confidence to keep investing in domestic oil and gas production, based on historic prices."" Last year, the Climate Change Committee - the government's own environmental advisers - wrote to the business secretary saying it would support a ""tighter limit"" on North Sea production, and that ""an end to UK exploration would send a clear signal to investors and consumers that the UK is committed to the 1.5C global temperature goal"". It also said an increase in UK oil and gas would have ""a marginal effect"" on prices faced by consumers. Environmental groups say that claims the industry would shut down overnight with the end of new North Sea licences are scare stories and that even one new oil and gas field in the region would push the UK over its carbon budget limits. Erik Dalhuijsen, the founder of Aberdeen Climate Action, is critical of both the government and Labour policies on the future of the North Sea. ""There is only one decision that can be made and that is that new exploration needs to be stopped immediately,"" he told the BBC. ""There is no room in our carbon budget for additional hydrocarbons. There is already enough hydrocarbons in the proven reserves to blow the climate change carbon budget several times over. ""The real answer to energy security is to generate your own homegrown energy, which is renewables. The Ukraine situation is evidence that fossil fuels are not the secure energy source that you need."" The oil and gas sector supports 200,000 UK jobs, according to trade body Offshore Energies UK. One of Mr Myerson's biggest concerns is around job losses if the North Sea sees no further investment. He believes it is unrealistic to expect someone working on an oil platform to be able to install a windfarm as they would not have the technical expertise. However, Friends of the Earth and others argue that with the right support and investment, the renewable energy sector could support three times as many jobs as oil and gas. Mr Dalhuijsen, who previously worked as a petroleum engineer in the oil and gas sector, is himself looking to retrain to retrofit buildings to make them more energy-efficient. My Myerson agrees that wind and solar are important technologies and Ithaca is looking to invest in them as well, but says: ""It's impossible to just turn off a switch and imagine we can live in a world without hydrocarbons.""

"Just Stop Oil trio deny Lord's Ashes Test trespass","By Jess Warren & PA Media",2023-07-31,"Three Just Stop Oil protesters who threw orange powder on to the pitch during an Ashes Test at Lord's Cricket Ground have denied aggravated trespass. Judit Murray, 69, Daniel Knorr, 21, and Jacob Bourne, 27, briefly stopped play during the second Test match between England and Australia on 28 June. According to the charges, they entered a ""redistricted pitch area"". They wish to hear proof the property is private, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. They will go on trial on 28 September. The protesters also believe it is possible for a person to enter a field of play without a match being disrupted, Hussain Hassan, defending, told the court. The defendants are accused of aggravated trespass, having obstructed or disrupted a person engaged in a lawful activity. According to the charges, having trespassed at the venue, they interrupted the match ""by throwing orange powder on the pitch"" with the intention of ""obstructing or disrupting that activity"". Ms Murray, of Plough Road, Surrey, Mr Knorr, of Green Street, Oxford, and Mr Bourne, of Moorland Road, Leeds, were granted bail on the condition they do not enter the grounds of a sporting event.

"Oxfordshire weekly round-up: 9 October-15 October 2023",NA,2023-10-15,"The excavation of an experimental catapult used to launch World War Two bomber planes was among our most read stories this week in Oxfordshire. A variety of local issues featured on the BBC News website, BBC Radio Oxford and South Today. We have picked five stories to keep you up to date. An experimental catapult designed to launch World War Two bomber planes into the sky has been excavated. The prototype Royal Aircraft Establishment Mark III Catapult was unearthed at the site of a development at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. It was made to enable take-offs using shorter runways and so the planes could be loaded with more fuel. The Radcliffe Camera building in Oxford has been daubed in orange paint by environmental activists. Oxford University said the main entrance and exit to the reading room were closed because of a Just Stop Oil protest on Tuesday. The group said student supporters painted the building in protest at the government's plans to licence new oil and gas projects. Oxford United FC has unveiled what its new 16,000-capacity stadium could look like. The club has released computer generated pictures of the proposed complex, which will include a 180-bed hotel, restaurant, conference centre and community plaza. It is subject to planning permission from Cherwell District Council. Residents at a housing development are planning legal action after they were promised local amenities that are yet to be built. The Windrush Place estate in Witney has more than 1,000 homes but no shops or a community centre. Developers Vistry, Persimmon and Bloor said they were ""fully committed to fulfilling [their] obligations"". Business owners have expressed frustration over the partial closure of a bridge connecting Oxfordshire and Berkshire. Motorists will have to use an 11-mile (18km) diversion while Goring and Streatley Bridge is shut over half term for gas main repairs. The company said the work was urgent and apologised for any inconvenience it would cause. Follow BBC South on Facebook, TX, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk.

"Dale Vince: Major Labour donor to stop funding Just Stop Oil","By Paul Seddon",2023-10-06,"Businessman Dale Vince is to stop funding Just Stop Oil, saying further protests from the activist group would be ""counterproductive"". Mr Vince, a major Labour donor, said further action was ""pointless"" because the government had shown it would drill for oil ""come what may"". Further disruption, he added, would help ""feed the Tories' culture-war narrative"". Instead, he said, he would divert funding to the anti-Conservative vote. Writing for the Guardian, he wrote: ""In order to 'just stop oil', first we need to just stop the Tories,"" adding that he wanted to dedicate his ""time, energy and funding"" towards increasing the youth vote. ""A vote for anyone other than Labour, or no vote at all, is a vote for another Tory government - this time with a mandate to pursue its anti-green crusade"". Mr Vince said he had supported Just Stop Oil since its foundation in February 2022, and given the group £340,000 to help its campaign against oil drilling in the North Sea. He said he had always defended the group's tactics, which have included blocking major roads, as well as disrupting high-profile events including Premier League football games and Test cricket at Lord's. But he added that the government - which granted 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences over the summer - had ""made clear that no amount of protest will sway it"". Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said the government would ""welcome more disruption,"" adding Just Stop Oil's tactics had been ""weaponised by the Conservative party"". He added it would also feed a ""culture war"" started by the government with its shift on green policies last month. ""They think they've struck electoral gold here in being anti-green,"" he said. He said Labour had not influenced his decision to stop his funding for the group, saying: ""this is completely my own decision"". Mr Vince's green energy company Ecotricity has donated more than £1.4m to Labour since 2014, comprising donations to the party itself as well as leader Sir Keir Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner. The company also donated £70,000 to the Liberal Democrats in 2015/16, and £30,000 to the Green Party in 2013. Although there is no suggestion Just Stop Oil has funded Labour, Mr Vince's status as a backer of the group has sparked calls from Conservatives for Labour to return donations from him, arguing it legitimises their tactics. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also sought to highlight Mr Vince's support, saying it showed ""eco-zealots"" from Just Stop Oil are ""writing Keir Starmer's energy policy"". Labour has rejected suggestions Just Stop Oil influences its policies, and defended receiving donations from Mr Vince, saying he is a ""perfectly legitimate person"" to accept money from. Indeed, in recent months Sir Keir has become increasingly critical of the group, calling its activists ""wrong"" and ""arrogant"". Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments, but says it will honour any licences in existence at the time of the next election, expected next year. The impact of Mr Vince ending his support for Just Stop Oil is unclear. According to its website, most of its money comes from the Climate Emergency Fund - a US network set up in 2019 to fund climate activism. Just Stop Oil says it also receives donations from the public and other organisations concerned about climate change. In a statement, Just Stop Oil told the BBC it was grateful to Mr Vince for his ""amazing financial and moral support over the past year"". The group said civil resistance ""really works"" - and it believed Labour had ""no intention of stopping"" the oil and gas projects the government was ""furiously rubber-stamping"". ""We remain convinced that politics is broken and the Labour Party are moral cowards,"" Just Stop Oil added.

"World records hottest day for third time in a week","By Georgina Rannard",2023-07-07,"The world's average temperature has reached a new high for the third time in a week, unofficial records show. Data analysed by a group of US scientists shows the global average temperature on Thursday was 17.23C. It breaks the 17.01C record set on Monday, surpassed just a day later when the average temperature reached 17.18C. The temperatures are being driven by human-induced climate change and the naturally-occurring weather pattern known as El Niño, scientists say. The El Niño Southern Oscillation, or ENSO as it is also called, is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth. It happens every three to seven years, and in the warming phase, warmer waters come to the surface of the tropical Pacific and push heat into the atmosphere. ""Climate scientists aren't surprised about the global daily temperature record being broken, but we are very concerned,"" Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said. It ""should be a wake-up call for anyone who thinks the world needs more oil and gas,"" she added. Before this week, the last time the record was broken was in August 2016. Experts warn that many societies have not yet adapted to more extreme heat and the impacts it has on people and the environment. The temperature readings come from a tool called Climate Reanalyzer. Scientists at the University of Maine use a combination of readings from surface, air balloon and satellite observations as well as computer modelling to assess average global temperatures. The readings are not an official government record, but they are closely watched as an indicator of how temperatures are fluctuating. On Thursday the US weather service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it could not confirm records that come partly from computer simulations, according to Associated Press. ""But we recognize that we are in a warm period due to climate change,"" NOAA said. Scientists warn that it is uncommonly hot and it is likely the records will continue to be broken this summer. ""El Niño hasn't peaked yet and summer is still in full swing in the Northern Hemisphere, so it wouldn't be surprising if the daily temperature record is broken again and again in 2023,"" Dr Paulo Ceppi, lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said. Higher global temperatures are likely to make heatwaves even hotter and wildfires more severe, he added. Last month was the hottest June on record, the EU's climate monitoring service Copernicus said on Thursday. In the UK, record-high June temperatures saw ""unprecedented"" fish deaths and threatened the survival of insects as plants they feed from wilted, warned environment groups. A study by the UK Met Office concluded that climate change made the June heat more than twice as likely. Scorching heat is continuing to hit parts of the world, with North Africa seeing temperatures of near 50C and parts of China suffering under 40C. Southern Europe could see more than 60 days this summer when conditions are dangerous for humans, the European Environment Agency warned in June. Higher-than-average heat also affects crops and raises the risk of wildfires. Heat increases in seas have also been detected in recent weeks, including a marine heatwave in the UK and Ireland. And Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent for June - 17% below average - since satellite observations began. Governments globally are committed to reducing their carbon emissions to reach net zero - the point when humans will stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Global temperatures will only start to approximately stabilise once the world reaches net zero, Dr Ceppi explains. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Ulez: Policing minister Chris Philp in Facebook group that praises camera vandalism",NA,2023-09-28,"Minister for Policing and MP for Croydon South Chris Philp is a member of a social media group some of whose members have celebrated the vandalism of Ulez cameras. The Facebook group, ""Croydon say no to ULEZ expansion"", also has six administrators, one of whom is listed as the mayor of Croydon, Jason Perry. The 2,000-strong group includes posts praising vandalism. Conservative MP Mr Philp said he condemned criminal damage of cameras. Tory mayor Mr Perry, who has not posted pictures of any damaged cameras, said: ""Firstly, I want to be clear that I disagree with any and all criminal damage and violence. The illegal act of vandalising cameras and letting down car tyres is wrong, no matter whether you are protesting against Ulez or a member of Just Stop Oil. ""The rules for the Facebook Group clearly say that encouraging illegal activity is not allowed, and my moderating team do their best to remove any posts which break the rules - but they are volunteers and cannot be expected to catch every comment. ""What is also clear though is that there is a huge strength of feeling in Croydon against Sadiq Khan's Ulez expansion. He has completely ignored our borough by improperly excluding opposing responses to his official consultation, trying to silence scientists, and issuing legal threats to the Council. I am not surprised that people are angry at his £12.50 daily charge on some of the poorest and most vulnerable in my constituency - but that anger should be directed through the ballot box next May."" The ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) was expanded on 29 August to include outer London, with cameras installed to enforce it. Drivers must pay a charge of £12.50 per day to drive a non-compliant vehicle anywhere in the zone under the London Labour mayor's controversial clean-air plan. Of the local anti-Ulez Facebook group, Mr Philp said he ""could not be held responsible for what others post"". ""I completely condemn law-breaking and criminal damage, including in relation to Ulez cameras, much though I disagree with Ulez itself. ""I have already publicly stated my opposition to, and condemnation of, criminal damage to the cameras. ""I cannot be expected to reply to hundreds or thousands of other people's comments on social media platforms."" The group includes multiple pictures of vandalised cameras and posts in support for the continued vandalising of them. This is despite the group rules stating: ""Please do not post any content or comment which encourages the vandalism of Ulez cameras"" At least 510 Ulez cameras were stolen or vandalised between 1 April and the end of August this year, figures from the Metropolitan Police show. The force is dedicating a ""significant amount"" of resources to tackling Ulez camera-related crime, Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has said. Barry Gardiner, Labour MP for Brent North, told the BBC it was ""deeply concerning"" and that ""the police minister and mayor of Croydon should immediately shut down this Facebook group, apologise, and make clear they condemn any criminal activity or damage."" A spokesperson for London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: ""People are of course entitled to show their opposition to policies peacefully and lawfully. But causing or promoting criminal damage is never acceptable. ""All incidents of Ulez camera vandalism are reported to the police for investigation, arrests have been made and the Met and TfL are using new methods to catch those responsible.""

"Radcliffe Camera in Oxford daubed with paint in Just Stop Oil protest",NA,2023-10-10,"The Radcliffe Camera building in Oxford has been daubed in orange paint by environmental activists. Oxford University said the main entrance and exit to the reading room were closed because of a Just Stop Oil protest shortly after midday. The group said student supporters painted the building in protest at the government's plans to licence new oil and gas projects. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thames Valley Police said it received reports of criminal damage on Radcliffe Square in Oxford at about 12:25 BST. The force said a 21-year-old man, from Oxford, and a 18-year-old man, from Norwich, had been detained and remained in police custody. The university said the building had been ""vandalised with orange spray paint"". ""The university does not support illegal action, including any unlawful protesting, and may, within its powers, take any steps it considers appropriate against any student guilty of such behaviour,"" it said. ""Access to the library has been temporarily redirected and steps are under way to remove the paint."" In a statement released by Just Stop Oil, a protester said they were calling on ""university leaders all over the country to make a public statement calling on the government to end new oil and gas projects"". Last month the Rosebank oil field, the UK's largest untapped oil field estimated to contain up to 300 million barrels of oil, was given the go-ahead by regulators. Thames Valley's police and crime commissioner (PCC) Matthew Barber called the protest action ""mindless vandalism"". ""Protest is vitally important to our democracy, but this isn't protest, it is simply criminal damage and I think such tactics have long ago stopped persuading anyone and instead alienate the majority,"" he added.

"Warmest September on record as 'gobsmacking' data shocks scientists","By Matt McGrath & Mark Poynting",2023-10-05,"The world's September temperatures were the warmest on record, breaking the previous high by a huge margin, according to the EU climate service. Last month was 0.93C warmer than the average September temperature between 1991-2020, and 0.5C hotter than the previous record set in 2020. Ongoing emissions of warming gases in addition to the El Niño weather event are driving the heat, experts believe. Some scientists said they were shocked by the scale of the increase. They say 2023 is now ""on track"" to be the warmest on record. September's high mark comes in the wake of the hottest summer on record in the northern hemisphere as soaring temperatures show no signs of relenting. The data, from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, shows that the month had the biggest jump from the long term average in records dating back to 1940. Scientists have been quite shocked by some of the detail in the data. ""This month was, in my professional opinion as a climate scientist - absolutely gobsmackingly bananas,"" Zeke Hausfather, an experienced researcher, wrote on X formerly known as Twitter. Beating a long term recent average by almost a degree is bad enough, but this masks even greater differences in some parts of the globe. In Europe, for example, the scale of heating was remarkable, beating the long term average by 2.51C. ""The unprecedented temperatures for the time of year observed in September - following a record summer - have broken records by an extraordinary amount,"" said Dr Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). One important measure that climate researchers look to is the difference between current temperatures and what they were before the widespread use of fossil fuels. Last month was around 1.75C above the temperatures during this so-called pre-industrial period - the highest figure for a single month ever recorded. This will cause a good deal of unease among researchers. Political leaders meeting in Paris in 2015 agreed to try and hold the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. September's figure isn't a breach of that agreement, because the Paris target refers to decades not months. But it is undoubtedly a worrying direction of travel. Scientists believe that this year as a whole will stay under that 1.5C limit, but 2023 is ""on track"" to become the warmest on record, according to Copernicus. The year to the end of September shaded the current warmest year, 2016, by 0.05C as the hottest ever. Extreme heat has continued into October, smashing monthly high records in many locations including in Spain. Global temperatures may surge even further above normal as the El Niño weather event is yet to peak. El Niño forms part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation - the dominant natural mode of global climate variability on Earth on seasonal or year-to-year timescales. During El Niño events, warm water comes to the surface in the East Pacific, releasing additional heat into the atmosphere. This is one of the reasons for surging global temperatures - when added to the long-term warming caused by humans, mainly from fossil fuel burning releasing planet-warming greenhouse gases. Experts believe the scale of heating puts new pressure on politicians to act, as they prepare to gather for the COP28 climate summit at the end of November. ""Two months out from COP28, the sense of urgency for ambitious climate action has never been more critical,"" Dr Burgess said. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Newspaper headlines: 'BBC suspends star' and 'calls in police'","By BBC News",2023-07-10,"The focus of most of the front pages remains the un-named BBC presenter, accused of paying a teenager for sexual images. The Daily Telegraph - among others - headlines the corporation's move to refer the matter to the police. According to the Daily Mail, the director general was not made aware of the allegations until last Thursday because bosses didn't at first register the seriousness of the claims. The Sun says the BBC has a ""sorry history of ignoring complaints and rumours about its own presenters, sometimes with appalling consequences."" The Financial Times reports that the US and Germany are under ""intense"" pressure from other allies to show greater support for Ukraine's eventual membership of Nato. The paper says both countries have backed a form of words for the concluding statement of the forthcoming Nato summit that does not fully endorse a ""pathway"" for Ukraine to join. And the Daily Telegraph says that an interview Joe Biden did with CNN - in which he said that he didn't think Ukraine was ""ready"" to join Nato - was considered by some Tory MPs as ""snub"" to Rishi Sunak ahead of their meeting today. The paper quotes former cabinet minister - David Jones - as saying that it ""would appear the US President had decided to side with a reluctant Germany, rather than with America's closest ally - Britain"". The Guardian's front page reveals it has discovered that more than 50 MPs have owned stakes in public limited companies - like energy suppliers and supermarkets. It reports that the information does not have to be disclosed in Parliamentary registers - unless the shares are worth more than £70,000 - and has, in effect, been ""secret"" until now. But the paper says it raises questions about possible conflicts of interest. Judges are being ""urged to get tough with Just Stop Oil protestors"" according to a story on the Times front page. The paper reports that ministers and police chiefs want judges to hand down longer sentences to deter the environmental campaigners from disrupting sporting events. It says they want the ""wider risk"" to the public - from pitch invasions and stunts - to be taken into account. Warmer springs are causing problems for British bumblebees - according to a big study featured in the Daily Mail. The paper says it shows the wild bees emerge from their nests six and a half days earlier - on average - for every one degree rise in temperature. It means - researchers say - that they could end up ""out of sync"" with the plants on which they depend for food, and that they may not be able to pollinate ""effectively"". The Times reports that drinkers at Wimbledon are being told to ""put a cork in it"" - after a player was put off her serve by a popping champagne bottle. It led to the Australian umpire John Blum issuing a public warning. This was described by one commentator as ""the most Wimbledon warning ever heard"". And the Sun features a story about Portia the pot-bellied pig - who has been rescued from a flat in Manchester. She weighed in at 26 stone after being fed on junk food and fizzy drinks for seven years. The paper says she is now being cared for at an animal sanctuary. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"South China Sea: Philippines says Beijing installed floating barrier in contested area",NA,2023-09-24,"The Philippines has accused China of installing a ""floating barrier"" to stop fishing boats from entering a disputed area in the South China Sea. The Philippines' coast guard said the 300m (1,000ft) obstacle was preventing fishermen from working in a lagoon in the Scarborough Shoal. China claims more than 90% of the South China Sea and seized the shoal in 2012. Commodore Jay Tarriela of the Philippine coast guard said the barrier was discovered by a patrol on Friday. Three Chinese coast guard boats and a Chinese maritime militia service boat installed the barrier when the Philippine vessel arrived, he said. The Chinese boats issued 15 radio challenges and accused the Philippine ship and fishermen of violating international and China's laws, before moving away ""upon realising the presence of media personnel on board the (Filipino) vessel"", he said. China's embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a request for comment, Reuters news agency said. Cmdr Tarriela of the Philippine coast guard said the barrier was ""depriving [fishermen] of their livelihood"". He added that Filipino fishermen say China typically installs such barriers when they monitor a large number of fishermen in the area. He said his organisation would work with concerned governments but would ""uphold our maritime rights and protect our maritime domains"". The South China Sea is a rich fishing ground that is believed to hold vast oil and gas reserves. More than half of the world's fishing vessels operate in this area. China's claims - which include sovereignty over land parcels and their adjacent waters - have angered not just the Philippines but also Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols. The US says it does not take sides in territorial disputes, but has sent military ships and planes near disputed islands in what it calls ""freedom of navigation"" operations. Beijing seized the Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and forced fishermen from the Philippines to travel further for smaller catches. It later allowed the Philippines to fish nearby when relations improved under former President Rodrigo Duterte. However, tensions have heightened since Ferdinand Marcos Jr became president last year. President Marcos Jr restored security ties with the US and in early 2023 granted American troops wider access to Philippine military bases. This angered China as a larger US presence in the Philippines provides Washington with an arc of alliances stretching from South Korea and Japan to the north to Australia in the south.

"Why India's soaring food inflation is a global problem","By Nikhil Inamdar",2023-08-30,"Erratic climate conditions - including the driest August in more than a century - have sent food prices spiralling above 11% in India, which is a major player in global agri-trade. Just as tomato prices begin cooling down, onions have gotten dearer by a quarter since June in the domestic market. And pulses which go into making the humble dal (lentil soup) are now around 20% more expensive than at the beginning of the year. India's got a ""curry problem"", some economists say, as the cost of a regular vegetarian meal jumped by a third in the month of July alone. With some key state elections this year and a big general election looming next summer, the Indian government has swung into action, unleashing a number of measures to tame food inflation. Following a ban on wheat exports in May 2022, India announced an abrupt stop to non-basmati white rice exports last month. More recently, the finance ministry imposed a duty of 40% on onions to discourage exports and improve domestic supplies. With sugar production expected to be lower this year, ""the likelihood of a ban on sugar exports has also increased"", according to Rajni Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge Group. The government could step up its response with further measures going ahead, analysts say. For instance, since the consecutive export restrictions on rice have not yet lowered domestic rice price inflation, ""the government could seek a more comprehensive ban"", global brokerage Nomura said in a recent note. So does India, with its aggressive defence of domestic prices, run the risk of exporting food inflation to the world? The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) believes it does, particularly with rice, sugar and onions. Over the past decade, India has emerged as the world's largest exporter of rice - it holds a 40% market share - and second largest exporter of sugar and onions. The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Rice Price Index jumped by 2.8% in July - its highest level since September 2011 - driven mostly by price increases in the Indica variety of rice whose exports India banned. This has amplified the ""upward pressure"" on the prices of rice from other regions, the FAO said. ""Since the ban was announced late last month, Thai rice prices have increased 20%,"" Joseph W Glauber, senior research fellow at IFPRI, told the BBC. The impact of this - particularly on the world's poor - could be devastating with food insecurity deteriorating in 18 ""hunger hotspots"" identified by the FAO and UN's World Food Programme. Rice is part of the staple diet accounting for a large share of the caloric consumption of millions across Asia and Africa. And India is a major supplier to these markets. Forty-two countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa get 50% of their total imports from India, going up to 80% in some countries according to IFPRI, and its share cannot be ""easily substituted with imports from other large exporting countries such as Vietnam, Thailand or Pakistan"". Elevated global food prices could also have other implications in these countries such as keeping food import bills high, leading to the use of precious foreign exchange, ""thus worsening balance of payment problems and contributing to inflation"", says Upali Galketi, senior economist at the markets and trade division of the FAO. But the increase in global food prices cannot be blamed singularly on India's actions. The termination of the Black Sea Grain Initiative after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme climate conditions across the world are other major contributing factors. The coming together of these market dynamics, however, has ""resulted in reversing the declining trend in international food prices observed since the middle of last year"", Mr Galketi told the BBC. Global food prices are at historical highs despite a slowdown in many parts of the world such as China. This is weighing on international food prices because of muted demand from these places. The World Bank expects its food price index to average lower in 2023 compared with 2022, driven by lower oil and grain prices. But analysts say the future price trajectory will depend on the impact of El Niño weather phenomena - something that could have far-reaching implications, and put further pressure on food markets. Amid the uncertainty, calls for India to reverse its ban on the export of key commodities have come from various quarters, including the International Monetary Fund. Besides contributing to global food inflation, ""export bans have other negative externalities, such as denting India's reputation as a dependable supplier and preventing farmers from benefiting from remunerative prices globally"", say analysts at Nomura. ""Trade restrictions could also exaggerate boom-bust price cycles. For instance, higher inflation in pulses in 2015-16 led India to significantly increase imports, but normal monsoons and stronger domestic production in subsequent years led to a supply glut and prices crashed into deflationary territory through 2017-18."" Others like Mr Glauber warn that ""importers may choose to find other more reliable partners if the benefits of diversifying suppliers outweigh price considerations"". But according to the FAO, the most significant threat comes from the likelihood of more countries resorting to export restrictions, which would ""undermine trust in the global trading system"". However, some say realpolitik and a resolve to increase food self-sufficiency will outweigh these other considerations in India, especially during a politically sensitive period. In the past, high prices of crops such as onions have led to electoral defeats in India; add to that an already wobbly consumption recovery. Higher cost of food, which makes for a big chunk of an average Indian's expenses, can eat into discretionary incomes ahead of the upcoming festive season, and derail this recovery further. India's central bank has already raised interest rates six times, and can do little more to control food inflation given that it is a supply-side problem. So the government is left with little ammunition apart from imposing trade restrictions. ""All countries right now are focused on controlling inflation in their own economies. I would say India also has to take care of its own interests before it starts worrying about global inflation,"" says Ms Sinha. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

"Just Stop Oil: Three charged after Wimbledon matches disrupted",NA,2023-07-07,"Three people have been charged after climate change protesters disrupted two matches at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. On Wednesday, Just Stop Oil activists stopped two contests taking place on court 18 by throwing orange paper petals and jigsaw pieces on the court. The Met Police said three people had been charged with aggravated trespass. They have been released on bail to appear at City of Westminster Magistrates court on 7 August. Two protesters halted the match between Grigor Dimitrov and Sho Shimabukuro at about 14:10 BST, then another activist targeted a later match between Katie Boulter and Daria Saville. The Met said Deborah Wilde, 68, of Wood Green, Simon Milner-Edwards, 66, of Manchester, and William Ward, 66, of Surrey were the people who have been charged.

"‘The state says our kids don’t exist’ - how LGBT life is changing in Italy","By Sofia Bettiza",2023-09-23,"Italian authorities are bringing in new measures targeting LGBT families and making it harder for them to have children. Many same-sex parents feel that a new law, which would make it illegal to have surrogacy abroad, is a personal attack against them. ""We have two options: to stay in Italy and face prison, or to run away."" Husbands Claudio and Davide (not their real names) have a baby on the way through surrogacy - a woman in another country is carrying their son for them. The practice is illegal in Italy and most of Europe, so couples travel to countries where it is legal - such as the US and Canada - and bring their babies back home. But the Italian senate is set to approve a bill that would make surrogacy a ""universal crime"" - one so serious that it would be prosecuted even if committed abroad, like human trafficking or paedophilia. No other country has a similar ban. If the bill becomes law, couples like Claudio and Davide could face a fine of one million euros (£872,000) and up to two years in jail. ""I'm afraid that our child won't have his parents because we will be in jail,"" Claudio says. The couple are terrified about what might happen to them and their child, and have asked us not to reveal their identities. They fear someone in the Italian government could find out who they are and target them. They are getting ready to escape, seeking political asylum in more LGBT-friendly European countries. Davide is learning Dutch and Maltese in preparation. ""I feel like I'm being forced into exile, just for wanting to become a father,"" he says. It would be an incredibly difficult move for the couple, who would miss their supportive community. ""Our families and friends are all really looking forward to meeting the baby,"" Claudio says. And they are heartbroken at the thought of being forced out of Italy. ""I don't want to leave my country. I am proud to be Italian,"" Davide says. ""I'm trying my best to be a good citizen, and now I'm being treated like a criminal - just because I want to have a family."" The surrogacy bill is part of the socially conservative agenda of Giorgia Meloni - Italy's first female prime minister, whose Brothers of Italy party is a direct political descendant of a movement formed by members of Mussolini's Fascist Party after the war. She describes herself as a Christian mother and is a firm believer that a child should only be raised by a mother and a father. This is a country where the influence of the Catholic Church has always been strong - gay marriage is illegal, and same-sex couples have fewer rights than in most of Western Europe. Artificial insemination or adoption are not options for LGBT couples here, so for many, surrogacy abroad is the only way to have a family. The practice has been at the centre of a fractious political debate. Meloni has described it as ""a symbol of an abominable society that confuses desire with rights and replaces God with money"". And Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini compared surrogacy to using a cash dispenser: ""An ATM-woman… that produces babies... is an aberration,"" he said. ""I will fight this barbarous and inhumane practice - just the thought of it makes me sick."" But Angelo Schillaci, Professor of Comparative Public Law at Rome's Sapienza University, calls the proposed law ""irrational"" and says it does not make sense to place surrogacy in the same legal category as paedophilia and crimes against humanity. ""This bill is seeking to punish things that are perfectly legal in countries that are our allies, such as the US and Canada,"" Prof Schillaci says. ""It would be like prosecuting someone for smoking weed in Amsterdam after they've come back home. ""This is really problematic because it's part of a wider attack on LGBT rights in Italy,"" he adds. Carolina Varchi, the Brothers of Italy MP who drafted the bill, vehemently rejects that. ""Most people who use surrogacy are heterosexual,"" she says. Experts have told the BBC that 90% of the couples who use surrogacy in Italy are straight, and many of them hide the fact that they have gone abroad to have a baby. But same-sex families returning to Italy with a child will not be able to hide. Ms Varchi strongly believes the new law will ""protect women and their dignity"". ""It's intolerable. Women's bodies are reduced to objects that are rented for nine months to bring a child into the world, who is then ripped away to be delivered to the clients."" Ms Varchi adds: ""We are not discriminating against children. This bill only targets the parents who commission a baby."" She told the BBC that surrogacy should be seen as a crime as serious as paedophilia, and prosecuted as such. However she suggested that most people would receive a fine, rather than face prison. In countries where surrogacy is legal, regulations vary - including whether or not a surrogate can be paid more than expenses, and what steps must be taken to ensure surrogates give free and informed consent. But Ms Varchi believes that even in countries like the US and Canada - where surrogacy is heavily regulated - women do it for the money. ""This is a business worth billions,"" she says. ""In 2023 we must have the courage to say that money cannot buy everything - it certainly cannot buy a woman's body, it cannot buy a human life."" But the families the BBC spoke to say they have great relationships with their surrogates. Carlo and Davide's surrogate even gave them a teddy bear that plays the sound of their son's heartbeat, which she recorded during an ultrasound. ""When politicians talk about surrogacy, they use the term 'uterus for rent',"" says Maurizio, whose twins were born to a surrogate in the US eight months ago. He feels the phrase is designed to humiliate. And it's not just surrogacy - the Italian government is also using other ways to make it more difficult for LGBT parents to create a family. Before Mauro and Maurizio were able to have their twins' American birth certificates recognised in Italy, their council in Milan - like other local authorities across the country - were ordered by the government to stop registering same-sex parents' children. At the time of our interview they told us that the move had so far deprived their twins of Italian citizenship and means they would have difficulties having access to the country's free health care system and nursery schools. ""Our twins don't exist in the eyes of the Italian state,"" Mauro says. ""They are treated like illegal migrants. It's profound discrimination."" It's causing them huge anxiety - every time they leave home with the children, Luisa and Giorgio, they carry all sorts of documents in case they need to prove that they are in fact their fathers. Brothers of Italy MP Ms Varchi points out that ""non-biological parents can ask our courts to adopt the children - in special circumstances, this will be recognised"". However this process, called ""step-child adoption"", is expensive and can take years. ""It's humiliating to adopt your own child,"" Mauro says. ""The government's belief that gay parents cannot raise happy children is homophobic."" In the northern city of Padova things have taken a more drastic turn. A state prosecutor has demanded the cancellation of 33 birth certificates of children born to lesbian couples dating back to 2017. All non-biological mothers will be removed and they will lose their rights over their children. Caterina is one of the children whose world has been turned upside down. Born using a Danish sperm donor, she has blond hair and blue eyes. Her mums, Valentina and Daniela, chose to register her in Padova because the city's mayor was willing to put same-sex parents on their children's birth certificates. But now their daughter is suspended in a legal limbo. ""All queer people in Italy are under attack. For the government, our families are not real families,"" Valentina says, holding back tears while she watches her 16-month-old chase rabbits at the park. As her daughter's birth mother, her status is secure. But the order from the prosecutor is that Daniela's last name be removed from Caterina's birth certificate. ""I won't be able to take my daughter to school, I won't be able to make decisions for her at a hospital, I won't be able to travel abroad with her, without Valentina's written permission,"" Daniela explains ruefully. ""If Valentina were to pass away, our daughter would become an orphan of the state, and she would lose me too."" All affected mothers in Padova are preparing to go to court to challenge the decision - but judges have routinely ruled against same-sex parents in the past. ""We feel like the Italian government is waging war against our children,"" Valentina says. Like other LGBT parents, they believe the right-wing government wants to impose its idea of a ""traditional family"". ""I'm really angry. This is a total injustice: our children are being targeted because of an ideological choice,"" Daniela says. So far, there is no suggestion the government will back down. The proposal to make surrogacy a universal crime is likely to become law - chipping away at the already fragile status of Italy's LGBT community. Those we spoke to told us that they don't want their children to be treated as second-class citizens - and they will keep fighting for their right to have a family. ""We are all furious,"" Daniela says. ""It makes our blood boil, and it gives us the energy to keep fighting. Like all dark periods, we have to face it with courage."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Coal: Ffos-y-Fran Merthyr mine digging unlawful - lawyers","By Steffan Messenger",2023-06-27,"Letting a huge mine keep digging months after planning permission ran out is potentially unlawful and sets a terrible precedent, lawyers have said. An enforcement notice giving Ffos-y-Fran opencast mine in Merthyr Tydfil 28 days to stop extracting coal came into effect on Tuesday. Barristers for climate activists argued the Welsh government and Merthyr council could have stepped in sooner. But the council said it had a ""contrary legal view of the situation"". It said it would not comment further due to ""potential litigation"", while the Welsh government said it wanted to bring ""a managed end to the extraction and use of coal"". Mine operator Merthyr (South Wales) Ltd has been asked to comment. The UK's largest - and now last - opencast coal mine at Ffos-y-Fran has a long and controversial history, and its closure is also turning into a drawn-out saga. Merthyr (South Wales) Ltd has until the end of July to stop all coal extraction, after its application for more time was refused in April on climate grounds. It means the mine - the size of about 400 football pitches - will have been able to continue operating for at least 10 months past the expiry of its planning permission in September 2022. Figures show that between 7 September 2022 and 31 March 2023, 199,307 tonnes of coal were dug up at the site. In an open letter of legal advice, barristers working with the campaign group Coal Action Network said the situation brought the planning system ""into disrepute"". Matthew McFeeley of environmental law firm Richard Buxton Solicitors said: ""It certainly sends a signal to other operators who may be considering whether to shut down their coal mine or oil well - do they need to do that? ""They may get away with a significant period of extraction without planning control."" Residents and campaigners have been protesting against the situation for months, sending in photos, video and drone footage of alleged mining. Chris Austin, 67, who lives near the site, said it had been ""incredibly frustrating"". ""The local authority could have acted almost immediately but they've dragged their heels on this,"" he added. Dr Neil Harris, senior lecturer in statutory planning at Cardiff University, said the fact an application to extend the mine's life was received just days before planning permission ran out was crucial to the ""elongated process"" that has followed. While the council could be seen as being ""a little cautious"" this was down to wanting to get the decision right in a ""really complicated case"" and not leaving itself open to legal challenge, he suggested. Merthyr (South Wales) Ltd, previously said it was in ""active discussion"" with the council about ensuring ""a safe cessation of coaling"" and ongoing restoration. The site employs about 180 staff, and supplies the steelworks in nearby Port Talbot, as well as the UK's heritage steam railways. A Merthyr council spokeswoman said: ""We have a contrary legal view of the situation. It is not appropriate to comment any further in light of potential litigation."" A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""Our position is clear - we want to bring a managed end to the extraction and use of coal. ""We are in a climate and nature emergency and the response must be swift and serious, so we can pass on a Wales we are proud of to future generations."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Cheltenham gas leak shows dire state of energy sector - Green Party","By Carmelo Garcia",2023-09-24,"A gas leak that could be detected from space is an example of the ""dire state of the UK's energy sector"", the Green Party says. The methane leak occurred at a gas main operated by Wales and West Utilities in Cheltenham in March. The amount leaked could have powered 7,500 homes for a year. Green Party representatives in Cheltenham said it could have been avoided if energy firms prioritised repairs over shareholder dividends. The leak was detected by University of Leeds in March with the help of specialist satellites. Daniel Wilson, the Green Party's parliamentary candidate for Cheltenham, said the methane leak was ""just another example of the dire state of the UK energy sector"". ""The people of Cheltenham pay ever higher energy bills just to see failures like this happen in our area,"" he added. ""Such events could be avoided if repairs were conducted before energy company shareholders were paid dividends. Why are those companies not being forced to invest in the supply infrastructure? ""This in turn would create jobs and stop events like this being repeated. It is time to consider, as the Green Party proposes, renationalising our utilities."" A Wales and West Utilities spokesman said: ""We are driven by quality and safety improvements, and since 2002 have committed to investing in a 30-year programme to upgrade old metal pipes at a cost of £1.4m every week which so far has removed 3m tonnes of carbon. ""With over 35,000km of pipes, our mains replacement programme is a significant undertaking but it is necessary to sustain and improve the integrity of the network and to prepare for the future delivery of greener alternatives to natural gas including biomethane and hydrogen.""

"Belt and Road Initiative: Is China's trillion-dollar gamble worth it?","By Tessa Wong",2023-10-17,"China is throwing a huge party to celebrate one of its biggest experiments in engaging with the world: its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Officials and leaders from all over the globe are in Beijing attending a high-level summit marking the BRI's 10th anniversary. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have arrived, and the Taliban government will also attend. Chinese media is awash with coverage of the BRI's achievements, including a six-part documentary on state TV. A signature policy of President Xi Jinping, the BRI is aimed at stitching China closer to the world through investments and infrastructure projects. With an unprecedented glut of cash pumped into nearly 150 countries, China boasts it has transformed the world - and it is not wrong. But Beijing's massive gamble hasn't entirely gone the way it had hoped. Was it worth it? From the moment the BRI was unveiled in 2013 with comparisons to the ancient Silk Road, it was clear China had sprawling ambitions. ""Belt"" refers to overland routes connecting China to Europe through Central Asia, as well as to South Asia and South East Asia; while ""Road"" denotes a maritime network linking China to major ports through Asia to Africa and Europe. It started off with heavy state-driven investment into hard infrastructure abroad. Most of the estimated $1tn (£820bn) has been poured into energy and transport projects, such as power plants and railways. Beijing touted this as an economic win-win - it told other countries these investments would stimulate development, while at home it sold the BRI as a way to help Chinese companies, boost the economy and burnish the country's reputation. It had limited success in meeting some goals, such as internationalising the yuan and solving Chinese companies' overcapacity. But China reaped a huge economic benefit in trade. A slew of agreements brought access to more resources such as oil, gas and minerals, especially as the BRI's focus  widened to include Africa, South America and the Middle East. About $19.1tn of goods were traded between China and BRI countries in the past decade. ""It's about Chinese state-owned enterprises going abroad... to help facilitate the flow of resources that China needs,"" said Jacob Gunter, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. ""It's also about expanding and developing export markets as alternatives to the liberal developed world."" This diversification has become crucial at a time when China faces greater tensions with the West and their allies. Take soybeans for example. China, the world's biggest importer, used to rely heavily on the US for supplies. But a tariff war with Washington forced Beijing to turn to South American sources, especially Brazil, estimated to be the region's largest recipient of BRI funding. Gas pipelines from Central Asia and Russia - and oil imports from Russia, Iraq, Brazil and Oman - have reduced Chinese dependence on Japan, South Korea and the US, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Having become the lender of first resort for many low or middle income countries through the BRI, China is now the world's biggest international creditor. The true scale of the debt - thought to be at least hundreds of billions of dollars - is unknown. Many of the loans, given out by both public and private lenders, are shrouded in secrecy. Now, from Sri Lanka and the Maldives to Laos and Kenya, countries are struggling with BRI debt. This puts the Chinese government in a tight spot. A real estate crisis and liberal borrowing by local governments has already created a ""debt bomb"" domestically - it's estimated to run into trillions of dollars. A sluggish  post-Covid economy and record youth unemployment have not helped. China has restructured BRI loans, extended deadlines and forked out an estimated $240bn to help borrowers make payments on time. But it has refused to cancel the debt. ""For China to simultaneously engage in debt write-downs overseas while domestic economic issues are not fully resolved - it will be politically challenging internally to promote that,"" said Christoph Nedopil, founding director of the Green Finance and Development Center (GFDC), which tracks BRI spending. This has marred Beijing's reputation. Some critics accuse China of engaging in ""debt trap diplomacy"" by luring poorer countries to sign up for expensive projects so that Beijing could eventually seize control of assets put up as collateral. This was the US' accusation over the controversial Hambantota port project in Sri Lanka. Many analysts argue there is little evidence of this, but it has heightened fears that Beijing is using the BRI to undermine others' sovereignty. China has also been criticised over its so-called ""hidden debts"" - governments don't know how exposed their borrowing institutions are, which makes it difficult for countries to weigh up the BRI's costs and benefits. Over the years BRI projects have also been accused of creating wasteful ""white elephants"", fuelling local corruption, exacerbating environmental problems, exploiting workers, and failing to live up to promises of bringing jobs and prosperity to local communities. One recent study by research lab Aid Data found more than a third of the projects face such problems. A growing backlash has prompted some countries like Malaysia and Tanzania to cancel BRI deals. Read other articles in our series marking 10 years of the BRI: ""Poor risk management and a lack of attention to detail and cohesion"" from Chinese lenders and companies are partly to blame, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. But the think tank and other observers have pointed out the borrowing countries are also to blame, either for rushing into deals without proper planning or mismanaging finances like in the Hambantota case. Observers also say China gives resources with fewer strings attached, which is less onerous than offers from global lenders or the West. ""China shows up with a 'one-stop shop' approach: 'Here are our banks and companies and we do everything from start to finish, and if you sign today we will finish that railway, and it will be done in time just as you campaign for your next election',"" pointed out Mr Gunter. ""It's a huge selling point to say that you can do it in one to three years with very little paperwork. Maybe it'll be a bit dirty and there may be labour rights violations, but your railway will be done."" Yet China has met one of its biggest goals - extending its influence. It is not just through railways and highways that China has created connections. Beijing projects soft power and positions itself as a leader in the Global South, paying for thousands of Chinese university scholarships, cultural exchange programmes and Confucius Institutes. The expansion of the Brics trading bloc too has been credited to China. Pew Research found that in the past decade many middle-income countries have increasingly favourable attitudes towards China, including Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. Mr Gunter noted that increasingly, countries in the Global South do not wish to choose sides in the US-China rivalry. ""China hasn't flipped many countries from a Western orientation, but the fact it has moved the needle to a middle ground - that is already a huge diplomatic victory for Beijing,"" he said. But observers have also raised concerns of possible economic coercion, where foreign governments feel pressured to follow Beijing's agenda or risk China pulling out investment. One Aid Data study of Chinese state-owned entities' loans to foreign governments found contract clauses that ""potentially allow the lenders to influence debtors' domestic and foreign policies"". In the UN, China has ""corralled other states into temporary coalitions"" to oppose measures critical of Beijing, while participation in the BRI has led several EU members to block or water down policies critical of China, pointed out the IISS. The think tank also said the BRI has become one of China's ""main instruments"" in its diplomatic isolation of Taiwan. Many nations that have shifted recognition from Taiwan to China in the past decade are BRI funding recipients, it noted. In South East Asia, Cambodia has consistently resisted condemnation of China's actions in the South China Sea, while Laos and Thailand have been criticised for arresting or allowing the abduction of Chinese activists wanted by Beijing. China now recognises some things need to change. Beijing preaches the mantra of ""small and beautiful"" where, through low-investment, high-yield projects, the BRI can have more relevance. Examples given by state media include bamboo and rattan-weaving programmes in Liberia, biogas technology projects in Tonga and Samoa, and promoting mushroom-growing technology in Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda. China has also announced a new ""digital silk road"" focused on telecommunication and digital infrastructure. Analysts say this would be a more sustainable stream of profits for Chinese companies, while lessening the impact of Western bans on Chinese 5G equipment. With this new strategy, China has cut down financing. It has imposed limits on external lending by Chinese banks, and investment deals are now nearly 50% smaller than they were five years ago, according to a GFDC analysis. It has also moved away from being the only creditor in the BRI, and started a platform where other countries and international banks can lend money. But Beijing has even grander plans for the BRI, which it now touts as the foundation of ""the global community of shared future"". In two white papers released this month, Beijing said its form of globalisation would be fairer, more inclusive and less judgmental than the one led by ""hegemonic"" Western powers which seek a ""zero-sum game"". ""The BRI is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by any single party,"" it said. Far from seeking domination as critics say, China claimed it is ""helping others to succeed while seeking our own success"". The view from China is that ""now globalisation is in danger. The West, in the name of 'de-risking', is actually 'de-China-risking',"" said Wang Yiwei, a professor who studies the BRI at Renmin University of China. The main challenge ""is how can the BRI build mutual connectivity and avoid a new Cold War"". Beijing's trillion-dollar experiment has created a powerful tool to wield influence. But the question is whether the world wants a Chinese-led world order. Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Newspaper headlines: Putin 'humiliated by mutiny' and Russia 'on the brink'","By BBC News",2023-06-25,"All of the front pages of Sunday's newspapers focus on the momentous and dramatic day in Russia as Wagner group mercenaries staged a rebellion in parts of the country. Some papers describe Vladimir Putin as being a president who is humiliated and his leadership has been left dented and damaged. The Sun on Sunday says President Putin has been ""pushed to the brink"" before the Wagner mercenaries halted their march towards Moscow as the paper puts it at the ""eleventh hour"". Russians will now see Putin is someone far weaker, according to the Sunday Express which claims the leader ""fled"" Moscow as mercenaries approached the capital. In the Sunday Telegraph British historian Robert Tombs believes while President Putin narrowly avoided a ""1917 moment"", he is ""gravely weakened"". But, writing in the paper he also has a warning for exiled Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin - adding ""mutineers tend to end up dead"". Prigozhin's last-minute de-escalation deal with President Putin prevented ""bloodshed"" on the streets of Russia, according to the front page of the Observer. While the paper makes a note of remarkable comments from the Mayor of Moscow who urged citizens to stay indoors. The Mail on Sunday asks whether the Kremlin ""bribed"" the leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to end the mutiny, as it cites UK security official sources. But, in the Sunday edition of the Daily Star the tabloid claims both sides are ""equally bonkers"". Elsewhere, the Sunday Times quotes a former donor to Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, who believes the groups are ""not accomplishing anything"". The paper says Trevor Neilson - who's a Californian entrepreneur - believes the movement has lost its way. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"The mobile game funding a revolution in Myanmar","By Oliver Slow",2023-08-27,"When soldiers in Myanmar arrested Ko Toot's friend and his pregnant wife after the February 2021 coup, he became so angry he decided to join efforts to remove the military from power - by using his IT skills. The app-based mobile game that he developed is based on ""real events"" in the country and has proved a hit - incensing the ruling junta and raising funds for the anti-military resistance. ""They had never done a single criminal thing in their lives,"" said Ko Toot of the couple, who were detained for supporting the pro-democracy movement. He didn't know what had happened to them. The BBC only recently established the woman was released within a day, but the man was held for about a year and a half. After their arrest, Ko Toot then heard the military had detained the wife and infant daughter of a pro-democracy activist it had been unable to locate. ""Imagine you are a young child and you grow up inside a dirty, stressful and sadistic prison, and you have no idea what's going on. It made my blood boil."" So Ko Toot, who works as an IT professional, decided he had to be part of the movement to oust the ""cruel and dangerous"" military - and began working on his game. Ko Toot spoke to the BBC by text message on an encrypted app, and would not reveal his location. We are using a pseudonym for his safety. Myanmar descended into almost full-scale civil war after the coup. More than 4,000 people have been killed by the military since then, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group. The UN says the death toll is ""likely to be far higher"". Gauging troop casualties is hard - the military has acknowledged losses but not given a figure. The exiled National Unity Government says the resistance has killed 20,000 soldiers, but the BBC has not verified this figure. Ko Toot's aim was to raise funds for arms and humanitarian aid for the anti-military forces known as People's Defence Forces (PDF), as well as increase awareness about the situation in the country. ""I felt that we had very limited international help and awareness,"" he said, comparing the coverage of the crisis in Myanmar unfavourably with that of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His game originally launched as The PDF Game in early 2022. It is free to download, but players watch in-game ads to raise money, and Ko Toot estimates proceeds raised so far total at least $508,000 (£403,000). He estimates he now makes between $70,000 and $80,000 per month, and claims the figure is ""increasing each month"". Players take the role of PDF soldiers fighting against military troops, and work through missions similar to real ones in Myanmar. Ko Toot said he created characters based on real people fighting the military, including doctors, Muslims and members of the LGBT community. He said it was important to document them because ""they are fighting in a real war"". The game is available on both the Google and Apple app stores, although it had faced issues due to the companies' policies around sensitive events, Ko Toot said. On Google Play it has been renamed ""War of Heroes - The PDF Game"". Google said it does not allow apps that ""capitalise on or are insensitive toward a sensitive event"", but that content is generally allowed if it ""intends to alert users to or raise awareness"" about the event. The name also had to be changed on Apple's App Store, to ""War of Heroes"", before it was removed from the platform - this was a ""huge blow"", Ko Toot said. Apple said the app violated its guidelines - notably that enemies in a game ""cannot solely target"" a ""real government, corporation or any other real entity"", as well as a policy around violent conflicts. It has since been reinstated after Ko Toot made amendments, including to the original artwork, as well as the removal of some military missions. ""This is definitely good news, and we expect to make more income now,"" he said. The game has also attracted the ire of the ruling junta in Myanmar, who in April issued a notice in state-run media warning the public they could face legal action for ""playing the PDF game"". It said ""terrorist organisations"", such as the exiled National Unity Government, had created the game to raise funds for PDFs, ""sow mistrust"" against the military and thus ""grow their anti-army revolutionary spirits"". Ko Toot is unfazed by the military's threats. ""I don't care what they say,"" he said. ""They have already tried to stop this several times, but we will just keep going - there's no way of stopping the digital strike,"" he said of the online efforts to defeat the military. The game has been downloaded ""almost"" one million times, Ko Toot said. (Google Play says it has been downloaded more than 500,000 times, while Apple does not provide information on the number of downloads.) He thinks the amount raised could be much higher than his estimate because, working with a small team, it has taken him a long time to receive some of the money. These funds are sent to local PDFs, and are used for food and arms for resistance groups, as well as humanitarian support, including funds for children displaced by the conflict and those injured fighting the military, he said. ""We just send funds to the defence groups, but don't say how to use them."" Formed in response to the 2021 coup, the PDFs have linked up with armed groups formed along ethnic lines that have been operating in border areas for decades. They are proving to be a much stronger force than many expected and the Myanmar military has lost control of large parts of the country. With limited finances and arms networks, grassroots funding efforts have been crucial in procuring arms and other supplies for the resistance, in a conflict that is heightening in intensity. Ko Toot said he had considered quitting several times, but ""the situation in Myanmar is getting worse every day"" and he wants to continue supporting the anti-military movement. ""The game has potential,"" he said, adding that he hopes to eventually raise $1m per month. ""I hope this money will help the [Myanmar] people, who need it desperately."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Oil fights to retain its licence to drill","By Douglas Fraser",2023-09-06,"As if attendees need reminding at the enormous Offshore Europe event in Aberdeen this week, prices can go up as well as down. And they're on another Brent crude rollercoaster. The globally-recognised benchmark cocktail of crude oil from several North Sea fields dropped a dollar on the event's first day, then surged three dollars to $91 per barrel. It's at its highest level since last November. In the past three months, the spot crude price is up 16%, and futures by 20%. Along with the pound weakening against the dollar since July, it's feeding through to higher prices for petrol and diesel. A litre of petrol is up in only a month from £1.45 on average to £1.52 - the fifth largest monthly rise in 23 years. Why? The market reacts to constraints on supply, with Saudia Arabia and Russia saying they will keep the taps turned down for a further three months in order to keep prices up. That takes us into the winter market, when energy demand can go up. On the supply side of the oil market, while prices have been subdued by some expectations of weak economic figures from the US to China meaning weak demand for oil, more recent data have pointed to demand strengthening. Energy traders are saying the Brent crude bench mark could be around $95 by the end of the year. All this looks a lot more subdued than it did last summer. August 2022 saw the peaks of prices for oil and gas. Six months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, bringing severe disruption to supply, traders rushed to secure supply for last winter. They succeeded. Europe's and the US's storage was filled ahead of target, and winter turned out to be mild, meaning less fossil fuel is burned. This winter remains a concern for energy planners, because much depends on temperatures. But markets have had 21 months to adapt to the new geo-politics of sanctions against Russia, and to pricing with that new source of volatility. The price of natural gas has fallen and stabilised far more than anyone could have foreseen a year ago. It now trades around  double the trend price before August 2021, when Russia began its squeeze on supply and prices began to rise. But the current price is far below the sky-high spikes seen last summer. For oil, at $90 per barrel, that is a welcome relief for energy users from the $120 peak, and the £2 litre of diesel. As we're seeing with oil this week, however, it doesn't take much to unsettle global markets. Britain used to source its gas through pipelines from entirely predictable suppliers, mostly in the North Sea. It now buys Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) on the world market, carried on tankers from the Persian Gulf and the USA, and has to compete for tanker-loads with Asian customers. So the threat of a gas drillers' strike as far away as Western Australia, choking off China's supply of LNG gas, has been raising fears of a supply shock in Asia, affecting prices in the UK and Europe. In Aberdeen, at the P&J Arena, venue for Europe's biggest offshore energy gathering this week, higher prices should be good news, meaning more profit on existing production and more investment projects get over the line for approval. But that's not how it's working out in the UK North Sea.  Offshore Energy UK (OEUK), representing oil and gas producers and part of the renewable energy sector, has published a report that says a vast amount of investment is ready for that Final Investment Decision, but it's not getting approved. It calculates there is £200bn could be invested over the next ten years, in both renewable and fossil fuel drilling. Half of that is awaiting sign-off. Oil and gas is getting up to £4bn investment this year - lower than expected because of slow approvals, and less than recent years in real terms due to cost inflation. A further £35bn  in fossil fuels could be invested over the next ten years, half in existing fields and half in new ones. But 70% of that investment is ""yet to be secured"". Over those 10 years, the expectation is of £70bn in production costs and £20bn in decommissioning of retired equipment. The industry grouping claims these investment decisions need a stronger business environment for regulation, planning approvals, grid connection consents, licences to explore and produce, the tax regime and government stability. In addition, they face higher financing costs than they did when these projects were in the planning pipeline. The context for this is the turf chosen by Labour and Conservatives to differentiate their approach to climate change and energy security - Labour wanting to stop handing licences for further exploration or production, Conservatives wanting to accelerate that process, and the SNP leadership meanwhile arguing for a higher environmental hurdle for producers to clear. The industry body's annual economic report is usually a sober assessment of its value in jobs, tax paid and the pipeline of projects to keep the industry thriving. It's a statement of progress and of intention. It doesn't read that way in 2023. The document is a hard-argued plea with governments and opposition for the industry's survival.  It is seeking backing for further investment and to maximise domestic production at a time of international volatility. In graphs and stats, it sets out the trajectory for Britain's energy use in the coming decades, and how much of that will continue to be from oil and gas, even if those net zero targets are achieved. The story since the turn of the century, as UK production peaked, is of 70% decline in production but only 28% decline in demand. The UK has gone from net exporter to net importer, in a big way. OEUK seeks to explain that offshore fields are draining fast, and replacing that production will require further field extensions or new fields to open up.  Twenty fields are due to retire this year, with only two opening. Of 283 fields in production this year, more than 180 are expected to stop producing this decade. These ageing fields produced 45% of UK oil and gas output last year. The report warns: ""The impacts of these trends are already being seen in production. Output in the first five months of this year was down by a tenth from the same period last year (6% decline in gas production and 12% for oil) and down by a fifth from 2018. ""This is double the rate of decline in oil and gas consumption, leaving the country relying on net imports for around one-third for oil and just over half for gas."" OEUK adds the employment case: 220,000 jobs directly and indirectly employed by oil companies, 93,000 of them in Scotland. Comments from David Whitehouse, chief executive of OEUK, reflect deep frustration that the industry has moved to the centre of the battle for power at next year's election between Conservatives and Labour. ""The transition to net zero will be the biggest engineering project this country has ever seen,"" he says. ""We need consensus to support the very industries and workers whose skills are vital for building our energy future. ""In recent months we have felt the direct impact of underinvestment in homegrown energy on job security for our workers, the competitiveness of our firms internationally and our future energy bills. ""Our report shows that with the right frameworks in place, this industry can make the long-term investments to help the UK tackle these challenges head-on. ""As the global race for energy investment accelerates, the UK must compete by making the most of its diverse homegrown industry, from oil and gas to offshore wind, hydrogen and carbon capture. Globally, this is the lesson other countries have learnt. We must not get left behind."" One big question is not whether Britain's oil and gas industry is in decline, but how fast it is allowed or forced to decline. In terms of barrels of oil or their gas equivalent (boe), 45 billion have been extracted since the Queen pressed the button on the Forties field in 1975. The industry estimate is of up to 10 to 15 billion remaining, but only around 8 billion of these being technically and financially viable.  But if there's a loss of investor confidence, OEUK foresees less than 4 billion being pumped - around quarter of the demand forecast through to 2050. A further question is how fast renewable energy can replace it when it, too, faces planning and consenting obstacles, a different windfall taxand and the higher cost of finance. And a third question is how willing Britain is to rely on imported energy. Any other industry that ensured domestic production of a vital strategic resource, at a time of growing geo-political tension, could expect to be given an easy time by government. But not while there's another battlefront, over climate change. And not when that industry does not protect resources for the UK, but sells them for the best price it can achieve on the global market. The industry's critics - and there are many of them, opposed to its high profits and to the climate damage done by its products - will be happy to see it on the back foot like this. They can produce graphs and stats that show the climate implications of continuing to produce and burn further reserves of fossil fuels. Armed with data on climate change, they have pushed the energy giants into the centre of the political arena, and forced them to fight - not just for exploration and production licences, but for their social licence to keep drilling.

"Just Stop Oil deny disrupting George Osborne wedding",NA,2023-07-09,"Just Stop Oil have said they were not responsible for an incident at ex-chancellor George Osborne's wedding, which saw a protester throw orange confetti over the newly married couple. The protest was similar to those carried out by the environmental group. But, a spokesperson told the BBC they did not know the protester's identity. The group had posted a clip from news agency PA on Twitter with the message: ""You look good in orange George Osborne."" In the video a woman in a smart floral dress approaches George Osborne and Thea Rogers as they leave the church and begins throwing confetti, taken from a union jack paper bag. In a statement the group said: ""If it was a form of protest (which is yet to be established) we applaud it and thank the person concerned. ""It was peaceful and not especially disruptive but got massive media attention for Just Stop Oil's demand."" The group added that the media should focus on more important issues including the government's decision to license over 100 new oil and gas projects and wildfires in Canada. It came as an email, widely shared online, made several unsubstantiated claims about Mr Osborne's private life. Reports suggest Mr Osborne has contacted the police about the email. Around 200 people, including ex-Prime Minister David Cameron and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove attended the ceremony in the village of Bruton, Somerset. Mr Osborne was previously married to Frances Osborne, but the pair divorced in 2019 after 21 years of marriage. Ms Rogers previously worked as an adviser to Mr Osborne, and in 2016 was awarded an OBE for her work. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Just Stop Oil protester denies aggravated trespass at Wimbledon",NA,2023-08-09,"An environmental activist accused of throwing orange jigsaw pieces onto a tennis court during a Wimbledon game has denied aggravated trespass. Just Stop Oil (JSO) protester William Ward, 66, admitted throwing the pieces, as well as confetti during a match on 5 July, but denied the criminal charge. Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Mr Ward challenged prosecutors to prove his intention and whether his actions disrupted the match. He is to stand trial in November. Mr Ward, a retired civil engineer from Epsom, Surrey, allegedly invaded the court during a match between Briton Katie Boulter and Australian Daria Saville at about 16:30 BST. He was later charged with aggravated trespass. Representing himself in court, Mr Ward denied causing disruption, saying the protest was timed for when the two players were taking a break. The defendant also disputed that the crowd was hostile towards him, arguing there was a mostly positive reaction. Mr Ward said he was forcefully dragged off the court by security officials. Followers of JSO, which calls for the government to halt all new oil, gas and coal projects, have disrupted several sporting events this year, including the Ashes, the rugby union Premiership final and the World Snooker Championship. On Monday, two other JSO protesters, Deborah Wilde, 68, of Wood Green, north London, and Simon Milner-Edwards, 66, from Manchester, both denied aggravated trespass after allegedly disrupting a match between Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov and Japan's Sho Shimabukuro on Court 18 earlier the same day. Mr Ward, who was released on unconditional bail, will stand trial alongside them at City of London Magistrates' Court on 7 November. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"Bristol grandma climbed M25 gantry 'in climate emergency protest'",NA,2023-10-25,"A grandmother climbed a motorway gantry in protest against the ""climate emergency"" not being taken seriously enough, a court has been told. Retired teacher Gaie Delap, from Bristol, took part in a Just Stop Oil protest on the M25 in November 2022. She told a judge she did it for the future of her grandchildren. Ms Delap, 76, is one of 12 Stop Oil protesters accused of breaching a court injunction aimed at restricting protest and disruption on the motorway. Several junctions across Surrey, London, Essex and Kent were affected by the Just Stop Oil action. Mr Justice Soole is overseeing a hearing at the High Court in London which is expected to end later this week. She told the judge on Tuesday a policeman had greeted her with ""some surprise"". Ms Delap, a mother of two, said she had been given climbing training by a Just Stop Oil mentor before taking part in the protest. Lawyers representing National Highways said protesters caused ""considerable delays"" and were in contempt of court. Ms Delap said she was unaware that an injunction was in place and apologised - other defendants said the same. She told the judge she had joined the protest after Just Stop Oil called for volunteers. ""I heard a Just Stop Oil Zoom call for climbers to volunteer,"" Ms Delap said. ""I thought, well, I am 76, I have never had any climbing experience, I didn't think I had to volunteer for that. But it went onto my mind and stayed there. ""I then followed it up with an inquiry about how I might get involved."" Ms Delap, who said demonstrators had gone to a ""safe house"" the night before the protest, said she had climbed a ladder and sat on the gantry. Ms Delap added: ""Why did I do it? ""My heart is breaking for the future of my six grandchildren and all future generations."" She told the judge that Just Stop Oil wanted the government to ""stop new oil and gas"" and said ""the climate emergency is a serious issue and it has not been taken seriously enough"". Others protesters accused of contempt at the hearing in the Royal Courts of Justice, in London, are: Charlotte Kirin, 54; Daniel Johnson, 25; Joseph Linhart, 22; Luke Elson, 30; Mair Bain, 36; Paul Bell, 23; Rosemary Jackson, 25; and Theresa Higginson, 25.

"COP28: Is the world about to promise to ditch fossil fuels?","By Justin Rowlatt",2023-12-06,"The UN climate change conference in Dubai is close to a big breakthrough on reducing the gases heating our planet, its United Arab Emirates hosts believe. Expressing ""cautious optimism"", the UAE negotiating team believes COP28 is gearing up to commit to phasing down fossil fuels over coming decades. Maybe even ditching them altogether. Hosting a climate conference in a petrostate sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but there are signs that it could deliver real progress on climate. Surely working out how to get rid of fossil fuels is what this UN climate conference is all about, you are probably thinking. But bizarre as it may sound, until just a couple of years ago fossil fuels were effectively ""f-words"" at these huge global gatherings - rarely ever uttered. The first formal debate about their future was at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 and the only commitment made there was a promise to ""phase down"" the dirtiest one of the lot, coal. Let's be clear, a pledge now will not mean the world will stop using fossil fuels completely. We are very unlikely to get any commitment on an expiry date, that would be far too controversial. And ""abated"" fossil fuels will still be allowed. That is when the atmosphere-heating carbon dioxide they emit is captured to stop it causing climate change. But at least the world will have acknowledged what has always been implied by these negotiations - that we need to deal with the main source of climate change. That would be an historic first and an important step forward. So why might it happen here in the oil-rich UAE of all places? A phase-out is in the text under discussion here in Dubai and is what the man in charge of these negotiations - Sultan al-Jaber, the president of COP28 and the head of UAE state oil company Adnoc - says he wants. Much to his annoyance this desire has not been widely reported. That is at least in part because Mr Jaber has been saying it in the kind of bureaucratic language only the most committed COP-heads understand. He says he is the first COP president to encourage ""parties to come forward with language on all the fossil fuels for the negotiated text"". He explains he is ""engaging with all the parties"" and wants them to come forward with ""common grounds and consensus"". Confused?  Here's my own crack at a translation: ""I've spoken to representatives of all the world's countries and urged them to agree in COP28's final text to phasing out the use of fossil fuels, or at least phasing them down."" Mr Jaber has repeatedly promised this summit will ""take a new road"", do ""unprecedented"" things and be ""transformational"". Many readers may be surprised that the UAE, a country built on a foundation of oil money, might be trying to get the world to agree to stop using the stuff. And you may have seen stories in recent days about Mr Jaber even questioning the science of global warming during COP28. He insisted on Monday that his comments had been misinterpreted, adding: ""I have said over and over again that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuel is inevitable."" Mr Jaber was joined at a press conference by the UN authority on climate science, Prof Jim Skea, who is head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Prof Skea explained that meeting the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C would mean getting rid of unabated coal completely by 2050. Oil will need to be cut by 60%, natural gas by 45%, he said. So, even in 2050 the world will still need a lot of the stuff the UAE is so rich in. But - once again - only if it can be ""abated"", if the emissions can be captured to stop them causing climate change and the technology to do that does not exist at anywhere near the scale needed. When Mr Jaber says the science has guided everything his team has done - which he has repeatedly done - this is the science he is talking about. In short, the UAE has recognised the world has to kick its addiction to unabated fossil fuels and has decided to put itself decisively on the right side of history by trying to own the decision. But yes, at the same time it is planning to increase capacity and sell even more oil. OK, so the boss of the talks wants it to happen, but what makes him think he can get a deal? More than 100 countries, including the US and the EU, have already said they want to see a phase-out of fossil fuels. China has traditionally been a hold-out on the issue but a couple of weeks back there was a hint that its position might have changed. For the first time it talked about targets for emissions reduction from electricity generation when US President Biden met President Xi of China at a summit in California. And remember, China is far and away the world leader both in the production and installation of renewable technologies. Russia has traditionally also been reluctant to support action on climate but the UAE team are very confident it can ""be persuaded"". That suggests some sort of deal has probably been done and experts on Russian climate policy say that is very possible. They say Russia takes a very ""transactional"" approach to these UN pledges, not least because Russian President Vladimir Putin - who's visiting the UAE and Saudi Arabia today - would not feel obliged to stick to any commitment anyway. But, Mr Jaber still hasn't quite got it over the line. His biggest problem is with his neighbour, Saudi Arabia - the world's second biggest producer of oil and gas (after the US). The Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, was asked whether his country would support a promise to phase down fossil fuels in a TV interview in the Saudi capital Riyadh earlier this week. ""Absolutely not,"" he replied. But I have it from a reliable authority that the Saudi state oil behemoth, Aramco, supports just such a move. Why? Because it would enhance the reputation of the country and make it easier for it to do business. And one last thought for you.  Saudi Arabia's leader, Mohammed bin Salman, has a very public modernisation agenda.  His model is the UAE, with its gleaming global business hub, Dubai. It's not in the bag yet, but keep an eye on Dubai. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

"Just Stop Oil: Activists arrested after Rokeby Venus targeted","By Adriana Elgueta",2023-11-06,"Two Just Stop Oil protesters have been arrested after glass protecting the Rokeby Venus painting at the National Gallery in London was smashed. The Met Police said two activists had been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage. Just Stop Oil named the pair as Hanan, 22, and Harrison, 20, and said safety hammers were used to smash the glass. Meanwhile, police said about 100 Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested after slow marching in the road at Whitehall. The vandalised artwork, by Diego Velazquez in the 1600s, was previously slashed by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. Following the latest incident, Just Stop Oil (JSO) said: ""Women did not get the vote by voting, it is time for deeds not words. It is time to Just Stop Oil. ""Politics is failing us. It failed women in 1914 and it is failing us now. New oil and gas will kill millions. If we love art, if we love life, if we love our families we must Just Stop Oil."" There had been reports that activists had targeted the Cenotaph memorial - action that has been criticised by MPs and the mayor - but the group and the police have denied these claims. Sadiq Khan and Labour's shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, both said that targeting the monument was ""unacceptable"" in X posts now deleted. Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said that JSO were ""now stuck to the Cenotaph"" as he shared a picture on social media site X. The activists said they had been moved to the base of the monument after shutting down traffic on Whitehall, an account supported by one officer at the scene. The Met Police confirmed that there were no offences linked to the Cenotaph and no protester glued themselves to the road. They added that the arrests were made for breaching section 7 of the Public Order Act at various points between Trafalgar Square, Parliament Square and near to the Cenotaph. Protesters failing to engage with officers can be arrested under section seven of the Public Order Act introduced this year. It states that an arrest can be made if their actions ""interfere with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure in England and Wales"". The government said the new measures would not ban protests, but ""only prevent a small minority of individuals from causing serious disruption to the daily lives of the public"". Human rights group Liberty responded to the arrests, saying: ""The use of this new power is a dangerous escalation of the attack on the right to protest, with protesters potentially facing up to a year in prison for standing up for what they believe in. ""These arrests are a clear attempt to criminalise people for exercising that right. The government, in passing these new laws, has tried to make it even harder for the public to stand up to power."" A series of Just Stop Oil protests have taken place in recent days, including on Wednesday when more than 30 people were charged after blocking Earl's Court Road.

Four men have been charged over the theft of an 18-carat gold toilet from Blenheim Palace in 2019. The £5m lavatory was stolen from the stately home in Oxfordshire shortly before 05:00 BST on 14 September. They are due to appear before Oxford magistrates on 28 November. A stretch of the M40 in Oxfordshire was closed after a lorry overturned across both carriageways. The vehicle crashed through the central reservation between junctions 11 and 10 near Banbury at about 16:30 GMT on Wednesday. Closures were in place on the motorway for more than 18 hours after the crash involving a low-loader, which was carrying a dustbin lorry. Thames Valley Police is not effectively investigating child neglect and abuse cases, the police watchdog has said. His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) Isaid the force was ""letting down children"" in too many cases. Thames Valley Police said it had taken ""significant steps"" in response.. The remains of a medieval castle, built in the wake of the Norman invasion under William the Conqueror, have been saved from ruin. The site of Wallingford Castle, in Oxfordshire, has been repaired thanks to a grant of almost £300,000 from Historic England. Across south-east England, 15 sites have been added to public body's Heritage at Risk Register this year and 25 sites saved. Sewage has been discharged in Oxfordshire's rivers once more following Storm Ciarán's heavy rain. Thames Water confirmed that ""overflows"" were ""currently discharging"" into the River Thames because of the effects of the storm. Its storm overflow map indicates multiple areas in the county where those overflows are taking place. The water company said this prevented sewers flooding homes, gardens, and streets.

"Weak currencies force up cost of living in Sub-Saharan Africa","By Nkechi Ogbonna",2023-11-15,"Arinola Omolayo owns a frozen food store in Ogba, a suburb of Lagos, Nigeria's commercial nerve centre, where she sells mostly imported chicken, fish and turkey. She says she used to be happy coming to the shop, ""but now I feel reluctant"". The reason is the soaring price of food. Frozen chicken now costs about 3,400 naira ($4; £3.50) per kilo - an increase of more than 26% in the past three months. ""Customers that used to buy 1kg of fish or chicken now ask for half a kilo... my bigtime customers I usually supply... 3-4kgs, now they barely buy 1kg,"" she says. Her suppliers blame the increase in the US dollar for the price rises, she says, adding it has made her goods very difficult to sell. Food, transport and commodity prices in Nigeria have been forced higher by a fall in the naira - which has caused a spike in foreign exchange rates and driven up inflation. Nigeria's not alone. Most Sub-Saharan African currencies are getting weaker against other global trading currencies like the pound sterling and the US dollar, resulting in the loss of value and purchasing power of these local currencies on the continent. In October, the World Bank published a report in which it said the currencies in Nigeria and Angola, Africa's biggest oil producers, were the two worst performing on the continent. The naira and the kwanza lost nearly 40% of their value against the US dollar between 31 December 2022 and 15 September 2023. ""The weakening of the naira was triggered by the central bank's decision to remove trading restrictions on the official market,"" the World Bank said. ""For the kwanza, it was the decision of the central bank to stop defending the currency as a result of low oil prices and greater debt payments."" The report listed other African currencies that fell significantly over the same time frame, including those in South Sudan (33%), Burundi (27%), the Democratic Republic of Congo (18%), Kenya (16%), Zambia and Ghana (12%) and Rwanda (11%). In Zambia, Africa's copper capital, the price of staple foods, including maize, meat, fish and the popular dried pumpkin leaves, has increased by more than 14% in the past five months. In some cases prices have doubled, pushing products out of the reach of some in a country where more than 60% of the 20 million population are classified as poor, according to the country's statistics agency. Many people survive on less than $2 a day. The huge gap between supply and demand for foreign currencies in these countries is one major issue. Once there is a shortage of foreign exchange, people have to turn to alternative sources, such as the black market. Black market rates are always worse than official rates meaning only wealthy companies and individuals can afford to use them for imports, raw materials, tuition, medical expenses, tourism and so on. Another factor is the huge reliance on imports, a common factor among many African nations. Many African countries import way more finished goods than they export. As a result, they need foreign currencies like the US dollar or the Chinese yuan to pay the international suppliers of those goods, increasing demand for foreign exchange, and reducing the reliance on the local currency. The dollarisation of the economy is not uncommon in parts of the continent. In countries like Sierra Leone, some goods and services are priced in US dollars at grocery stores, thereby increasing the demand for dollars and reducing demand for the leone, the local currency. Foreign exchange scarcity or higher exchange rates force manufacturers to pay more to import their raw materials, which increases the cost of production. In most cases, the final consumer bears the additional costs via increased prices in the shops and higher transport costs. Businesses suspend operations and investors take fright when they cannot retrieve their money in foreign currency from the central bank. One such example is Emirates Airlines. It suspended operations in Nigeria for more than a year after it found it could not repatriate $85m in funds from ticket sales trapped in the country. The International Air Transport Association said altogether carriers had $812m stuck in Nigeria, more than any other country - and almost half of the total worldwide. Of course, you might think oil producing countries like Nigeria and Angola would have vast amounts of money and foreign exchange since oil is sold in US dollars. However, their governments have run up huge debts that need to be serviced and which eat up foreign currency reserves. Many countries also use up vast amounts of money heavily subsidising local fuel and energy prices. As a result, these countries don't really benefit from the soaring oil prices in the global market. Nigeria's central bank announced it would inject $10bn worth of foreign exchange into the market, mainly sourced from crude oil sales and foreign investments. This will be used to pay foreign exchange debts that were previously impossible to settle because of limits on how much foreign exchange could be used. Africa's largest economy also lifted the ban on 43 imported items, including rice, cement and steel products, which people had previously been barred from using foreign currency to buy. That had meant such importers turned to the black market, forcing up prices. The aim of the relaxation is to reduce demand for foreign currency, but it's opposed by local manufacturers who fear it will undermine their competitiveness. Neighbouring gold-rich Ghana implemented its ""gold for oil"" policy late last year. The government uses gold instead of cash to buy oil. The idea is to reduce pressure on the weak Ghana cedi and bring in cheaper fuel in exchange for gold. So far the scheme has saved the country about $5bn in foreign reserves, the government said in August. Egypt has requested a barter agreement with the world's biggest exporter of black tea, Kenya. This involves exchanging goods for goods, while Egypt saves its foreign reserves, relying less on the US dollar. Earlier this month, Zambia's central bank said it would increase the amount of foreign currency deposits that banks must hold, in an effort to build up the country's foreign exchange reserves, and support the value of the local kwacha currency. The impact of the weak local currencies has sparked renewed debate about the full implementation of the Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) as a way of ditching reliance on foreign currencies to trade. Established in 2018 AfCFTA aims to create a single market for goods and services and boost intra-African trade and investment. Once it's fully up and running it will be the biggest free trade area in the world in terms of population, covering a market of 1.3 billion people. Muda Yusuf,  a director at the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise in Nigeria says African nations need to trade with each other and buy locally made goods to support the local currencies. But to match global standards in goods and services Africa must ""strengthen productivity and competitiveness, both in price and quality"", he says. The lack of infrastructure also makes it more difficult to trade within Africa. ""The continent has weak connectivity by rail and road, which are more important than air travel, because of the volume of trade. This must be prioritised to actualise the continental free trade agreement,"" Mr Yusuf says. Back in Lagos it's clear just how badly soaring prices have damaged business in Arinola Omolayo's shop. While we were talking, no customers stopped by to buy anything. ""If it was when I was busy with sales, I won't even have the time to grant you this interview,"" she says. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Archive photos mark 60 years of Dartford Crossing","By Andy Trigg",2023-11-18,"Archive photos of the Dartford Crossing have been released to mark 60 years since it first opened. The crossing, which links Essex and Kent, remains the only road across the River Thames east of London. More than a billion vehicles are thought to have used the crossing since the first tunnel opened on 18 November 1963, National Highways said. The 60-year anniversary was marked by ten classic cars travelling through the tunnel on Friday. National Highways, which manages the crossing on behalf of the Department for Transport, said the idea of a tunnel connecting Kent and Essex was first conceived in 1926. Works started in the 1930s but were suspended due to World War Two. Before the crossing opened, anyone wanting to travel between Kent and Essex had to take a ferry or use the Blackwall tunnel. The crossing is now considered one of the UK's most important transport routes, carrying more than  50 million vehicles a year – about 180,000 a day. Francis Cluett, head of delivery at National Highways, said he thought it was important to mark Saturday's anniversary. ""It was an amazing engineering achievement at the time,"" he said. ""The tunnel has provided vital connections between people, jobs, and businesses for 60 years."" National Highways said the crossing was initially designed to carry about two million vehicles each year. However, due to increasing demand, an additional tunnel was constructed, which opened in 1980, and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge opened in 1991. The RAC said motorists using the Dartford Crossing were always required to pay a toll, which in 1963 cost two shillings and sixpence. In 1999 it was announced that the crossing would be free by the end of 2003 - however two years later, ministers backtracked on the agreement. Today, the Dart Charge is between £2 and £6, depending on the vehicle, and free to use between 22:00 and 06:00 GMT. Before 2014, fees were paid at booths, often causing long delays. But since then motorists have been able to pay online, over the phone, by post or at Payzone retailers. Those that do not pay face being fined. Earlier this year,  a new online payment system for the Dart Charge was launched which caused issues for motorists following a ""technical issue"". National Highways is now proposing to construct a new road and tunnel, the Lower Thames Crossing, to almost double road capacity across the River Thames east of London. The project's detailed examination by the government's independent planning team is under way, and if approved, construction could start in 2026. Conservative councillor and leader of Dartford Borough Council, Jeremy Kite, said: ""Today, as vehicle sizes and traffic volumes increase, Britain needs to show similar vision and get on with a new Thames crossing east of Dartford to relieve the pressure here and put the region's economic potential back on track. ""It's time to get things started safe in the knowledge that we are doing the right thing for future generations."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

"Oil giant Shell warns cutting production 'dangerous'","By Simon Jack",2023-07-06,"Cutting oil and gas production would be ""dangerous and irresponsible"", the boss of energy giant Shell has told the BBC. Wael Sawan insisted that the world still ""desperately needs oil and gas"" as moves to renewable energy were not happening fast enough to replace it. He warned increased demand from China and a cold winter in Europe could push energy prices and bills higher again. Mr Sawan angered climate scientists who said Shell's plan to continue current oil production until 2030 was wrong. Professor Emily Shuckburgh, a climate scientist at the University of Cambridge, said firms such as Shell should focus on accelerating the green transition ""rather than trying to suggest the most vulnerable in society are in any way best served by prolonging our use of oil and gas"". Head of the UN António Guterres recently said investment in new oil and gas production was ""economic and moral madness"". Mr Sawan told the BBC: ""I respectfully disagree."" He added: ""What would be dangerous and irresponsible is cutting oil and gas production so that the cost of living, as we saw last year, starts to shoot up again."" The world is in a race to ditch fossil fuels in favour of greener alternatives as globally leaders have pledged to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C this century. Last year the European Commission outlined how the EU would speed up its shift to green energy to end its dependency on Russian oil and gas. Many countries do not have the infrastructure to move to more sustainable forms of energy. Mr Sawan said an international bidding war for gas last year saw poorer countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh unable to afford liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments that were instead diverted to Northern Europe. ""They took away LNG from those countries and children had to work and study by candlelight,"" he said. ""If we're going to have a transition it needs to be a just transition that doesn't just work for one part of the world."" Claire Fyson, co-head of climate policy at Climate Analytics, a global science and policy institute, told the BBC: ""The idea that it's a choice between our addiction to fossil fuels or working by candlelight is a gross misrepresentation of reality, when we know renewables are cleaner, cheaper and better for public health."" The UK has pledged to spend £11.6bn on international climate finance but a memo seen by the BBC said economic shocks like the Covid pandemic had ""turned a stretching target into a huge challenge"". The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has said that ""if governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal from now"". Here are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips: What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? Shell has a long history and a headquarters in the UK. But Mr Sawan said a lack of clarity and stability on energy policy and taxation risked making the UK a less attractive place to invest compared with more welcoming countries. The UK has increased tax on UK-derived profits from 40% to 75% until 2028 unless oil and gas prices fall below thresholds for a sustained period - which most energy experts doubt will happen. The UK currently imports more than half of its oil and gas - and that proportion is expected to rise without renewed investment in the North Sea. Shell recently decided to sell its stake in a major new undeveloped oil field at Cambo. ""Ultimately the government needs to make a call as to their views on imported versus domestic production,"" said Mr Sawan. ""When you do not have the stability you require in these long-term investments, that raises questions when we compare that to other countries where there is very clear support for those investments."" Mr Sawan was also keen to stress the warm welcome extended to the company by the New York Stock Exchange at a recent investors' meeting where they laid out their plans to cut costs and maximise profits. ""The welcome we had there was exemplary. The Shell flag was waving next to the New York Stock Exchange flag,"" he said. He said that the officials there had underlined his feeling that the US was more supportive of oil and gas companies. ""They said we continue to value a company that provides us the energy we desperately need. That resonated with me as a person who comes from Lebanon where we are starved of energy."" Mr Sawan did not rule out moving Shell's headquarters and stock market listing to the US. American oil companies command higher prices for their shares - Exxon Mobil for example is worth 40% more than Shell per dollar of profit. ""There are many who question whether that valuation gap can only be bridged if we move to the US. A move of headquarters is not a priority for the next three years."" But after that? ""I would never rule out anything that could potentially create the right circumstances for the company and its shareholders. Ultimately, I am in the service of shareholder value,"" he said. Although Shell says it has no plans to move in the short term, Mr Sawan's comments will add to fears that London's stock market is losing its lustre as a venue for multinational companies to raise money after technology darling Arm Holdings recently announced plans to move its primary listing to the US. A move by the UK's most valuable company to the US would seriously dent Britain's financial prestige and cost jobs in the financial services sector. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Who pays if oil and gas are put into decline?","By Douglas Fraser",2023-06-25,"It didn't take long for the oil and gas industry to show the impact of the UK's political jeopardy. Sir Keir Starmer was in Edinburgh at the start of the week, choosing the symbolism of Leith as a supply centre for offshore wind power and the Scottish capital as a centre for financing the Great Energy Transition. Scotland was more than just symbolic as the location. The policy of refusing any new licences for offshore oil and gas drilling is politically difficult. There are 90,000 Scottish jobs in the industry - fewer than the rest of the UK, but more concentrated in the north-east. Making the case for shutting down the industry is tricky. Sir Keir Starmer's approach was to tell those workers the change is coming anyway, so it's best to do it soon. ""This has to happen eventually,"" he said. ""The only question is when. The moment for decisive action is now. If we wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out, the opportunities this change can bring will pass us by, and that would be a historic mistake."" Within hours, the impact of windfall tax and licence blocks was clear from a statement issued by Parkmead. The oil and gas driller, with a focus on the North Sea, was putting the brakes on a large development to the north-east of Fraserburgh. It faces ""unprecedented challenges associated with volatile oil and gas prices, ageing infrastructure and rising capital and operating costs"", it said. Labour Party hostility to new drilling is just one of many such problems. Parkmead also highlighted the UK government's windfall tax (from which Labour intends to extract more revenue) plus ""loss of key equipment and human resources from the UK North Sea"" and the cost of capital due to rising interest rates. Facing ""very high hurdles"", its board is opting to ""be very careful and selective in its forward UK investment strategy"", so it is focussing on gas rather than oil, and only where they can be developed rapidly, alongside renewable energy assets. So the Perth field, with costs rising to $1bn (£790m) is kyboshed. It would have required deployment of some ""ultra late-life"" assets nearby - meaning pipelines and platforms that are nearing the end of their working lives and are therefore more expensive to keep in operation. Parkmead was looking for industrial partners to share the risk, as is common, known as a farm-out. And ""multiple parties"" were interested. But there were too many concerns over the longevity of nearby infrastructure. ""In particular, industry concerns were highlighted over the recent numerous fiscal changes which has led to a large increase in effective taxation.  Such an increase materially damages project economics, undermining the usual risk-reward equation associated with making major offshore oil and gas field investment decisions. ""These factors, combined with a lack of public and political support for new oil projects, have resulted in a very cautious and conditional approach from industry during these partnering discussions."" This was an unusually open explanation of why a North Sea driller was not going to do progress a project, along with a statement to investors that the company is taking a £33m hit, as it walks away from the Perth licences. It illustrates that there's a lot working against the future of the offshore oil and gas industry in the UK, and the prospect of an incoming Labour government is just one aspect of that. Parkmead is not against further acquisitions, but its financial rationale is that it has £150m of losses on its books that can be used to offset tax. That makes it attractive to take on assets from those firms which would otherwise face a 75% tax on profits. And with that background, it is pressing ahead with drilling on the more promising Skerryvore field, also in the central North Sea. There is further evidence of value in the North Sea basin for hydrocarbons, with the sale of another Aberdeen-based driller, Neptune, to the Milan-based ENI oil giant. With assets spread widely but mainly in the UK and Norway, the transaction is worth around $5bn (£3.9bn). The logic for this deal seems to be ENI's drive towards net zero by 2030. Neptune's assets are big on gas, including the large Cygnus field, and the shift from oil to gas helps reduce the new owner's carbon intensity. But the politics of this, according to Labour policy, is to go harder and faster towards slowing the flow of oil and gas from UK waters. It sets up a dividing line between Labour and Tory, in which Sir Keir Starmer's compromise with the industry is to let Conservative ministers licence as much as they want before the next Westminster election - and that could be as many as a hundred projects - while Labour promises not to reverse those decisions. The SNP tends towards the Labour position on licensing, but with wiggle room to allow some drilling if it can be mitigated. Under current constitutional arrangements, it won't have the powers to decide, as these lie with Westminster and its agency, the North Sea Transition Authority. Labour's position would make the energy transition one of its biggest commitments and challenges, if it wins the election next year. It risks a rush, and possibly haste, to grab licences and get to work, when - as Parkmead noted - there are constraints on finance and personnel. The policy risks pleasing nobody, as the campaign to ""keep it in the ground"" sees progress in making it non-viable to keep drilling, and as the Scottish Labour party has to defend its transition plan to those industry workers. A sign of the frustration came from veteran Labour councillor and Aberdeen lord provost, Barney Crockett, who quit the party in disgust. The industry has been campaigning hard to make the case for energy security. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, with energy prices soaring last year and now falling back, the case for reducing dependence on imported energy has had a stronger pull. Imports come with a bigger carbon footprint than natural gas piped from UK fields, particularly where they are transported as liquified natural gas. Prices are no less volatile from domestic production, however. They continue to be set in international markets, and the UK contribution has only a marginal impact. But there is an advantage to domestic production in limiting the bill on foreign exchange. Last year, the import bill doubled to £117bn. Meanwhile, it's seen as likely that the wind-down of the industry globally will leave production increasingly in the hands of those countries which are doing least to limit environmental damage and whose track record as responsible and reliable trading partners is far from ideal. Offshore Energy UK, representing the sector, points to an accelerated decline for UK output if British governments push to put their own production at a disadvantage, either through higher tax or through licence constraints. Big old fields are depleting. Last year, the industry was on course for a rapid acceleration of its decommissioning of equipment, more than doubling the number of jackets and topsides being scrapped, 330 km (205 miles) of pipelines shut down, a rise from 124 to 196 wells decommissioned, and more than trebling the tonnage of subsea equipment removed, to more than 1,100 tonnes. That constrains the opportunity to use such assets for exploiting further fields, as Parkmead noted about its plans for Perth. Maintaining the flow requires new fields to be brought onstream and newer ones discovered. Only 12 recently-opened gas fields account for nearly a third of the UK's gas output. ""The UK's oil and gas fields are in natural long-term decline. UK oil and gas production will never increase and new developments are needed simply to minimise that decline,"" says OEUK. ""UK oil and gas resources occur in multiple small reservoirs which become depleted, so constant investment is needed to develop new sources to replace those are no longer viable. This 'churn' is the only way to maintain production. ""Without such investment, UK oil and gas output would fall around 80% by 2033. This would make the UK even more dependent on imports and increase the 'energy gap' - meaning the difference between what we produce and what we consume."" The industry grouping says that faster decline in production would be at a rate of 15% per year, whereas a scenario with sustained investment would limit it to 8% annual decline. So here's the dilemma. International agreements, and particularly the COP21 Paris summit in 2015, point to a pressing need to stop developing new oil and gas assets. Exploiting the resources already discovered and in production would itself push greenhouse gases beyond the agreed international limits. The move to renewable energy will take time, and until the capacity is there to generate, to transmit and to connect the shift to green electricity from oil-fuelled transport and gas-fuelled heating, the demand for oil and gas is not going away. Cutting back on supply doesn't, in itself, cut demand. It could help to do so if it pushes up prices, making it more financially attractive to make that shift. But using price as the mechanism is politically difficult. Governments are constrained in how much they can commit to the enormous capital costs required to replace the UK's 24 million gas boilers heating British homes. With higher prices, those least able to pay the capital costs will be those left with the expensive old boilers. Those living in the poorest areas are most likely to be the ones left with the petrol-guzzling cars, furthest from reliable charging points. Asked how energy bills are supposed to be falling by 2030, as it claims they will, Labour's answer is that renewable energy is already cheaper than gas-fired power stations. But that's for turbines already installed, and the comparison is with gas at recent high prices. For decades to come, bills are going to be paying off the capital costs of many more turbines required, and the wiring to get offshore wind power to customers - itself a logistical and political challenge. Supply chains are stretched, and the industry warns that costs are rising. As we've found in the past year, soaring energy bills only serve to distract people from the Great Energy Transition, while they struggle to get through the current crisis for the household budget. So sequencing is important, to reduce price volatility. The challenge of doing this in a fair, equitable way is a huge one, and choking off supply without a simultaneous path to the transition risks making it worse. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Newspaper headlines: French police 'at war' and Meghan column 'sexist'","By BBC News",2023-07-01,"The Daily Telegraph's front page features a large image of riots in Marseille in southern France. It carries a quote from police unions which said officers were ""at war with vermin"". The Daily Mirror features several pictures from the rioting on its inside pages, and says Paris is in ""turmoil"". Several of the papers report that UK tourists are being warned about travelling to the country with more than two million British people due to visit in the coming weeks. The Financial Times says this week's protests will hamper Emmanuel Macron's attempts to move on from mass demonstrations about pension reforms. The prime minister's 15-year strategy to improve the NHS in England is in most of the morning editions. The Guardian has a warning from doctors' unions, who say the plan to shorten medical training by a year could dilute the calibre of the workforce. It's a similar theme in the i paper which raises concerns over the safety of apprenticeships. The Daily Mail focuses on Rishi Sunak's pledge to make new dentists spend more time working for the health service. The paper quotes him as saying it is unacceptable that two in three dentists head to private practice straight after qualifying. The Times carries quotes from the British Dental Association which says the move would ""handcuff the next generation of dentists to a sinking ship"". That story also makes the front page of the Daily Express. The Conservatives are considering including a pledge to hold a referendum on migration in their general election manifesto, according to the i. The paper claims that voters could be given a choice on quitting the European Convention on Human Rights after the government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda was ruled unlawful. It's spoken to a former government aide who describes the idea as ""Brexit part two"". In his column for the Daily Mail, Boris Johnson says it's time to ""Get Rwanda Done"". The Times says volunteers at the RNLI have complained that the organisation is rife with ""abhorrent"" and ""disgusting"" levels of sexism and misogyny. The paper has seen documents which it says provide a snapshot of widespread concerns of bigotry including suggestions that women should not be at sea. The RNLI tells the paper there's no place for such behaviour in its workforce, and it will take action where necessary. The Daily Express leads on an interview with the royal expert Michael Cole who says Princes William and Harry must end their feud. Today would have been Princess Diana's 62nd birthday, and the paper says the rowing brothers should ""bury the hatchet"" and honour their mother's memory. The Sun leads on a Just Stop Oil protest which was halted in London after a stag do ran off with one of their banners. A man dressed in a pink T-shirt and a tutu interrupted the demonstration outside Waterloo station yesterday. The paper's headline is ""Foiled again"". And the Telegraph says tennis fans who buy strawberries at Wimbledon will get more bang for their buck. Organisers have confirmed that the cost of a punnet, containing ten berries, will remain at £2.50, despite inflation. The fruits are likely to be bigger and sweeter this year due to a slightly late harvest. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?","By Michael Race",2024-01-12,"Global supply chains are facing severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea. Attacks by Houthis in Yemen on commercial vessels have resulted in many firms deciding to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, though it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in response to the attacks on shipping. The Houthis have been stepping up their attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The group, which is backed by Iran, has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Ships usually take this route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north. But because of the attacks and the threat of future assaults, several of the world's largest shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels away to a much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent. BP has also paused all shipments of oil through the Red Sea, blaming the ""deteriorating security situation"". The longer journeys add at least 10 days to shipping times and cost companies millions of dollars. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come via the strait of Bab al-Mandab and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). About nine million barrels of oil per day were shipped through the Suez Canal in the first half of 2023, according to freight analytics firm Vortexa. Analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence said nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. But it is not just about oil. Container ships carry all sorts of consumer goods seen in the shops including TVs, clothes, trainers and sports equipment. It is inevitable that supply chains will be affected due to ships being diverted away from the Red Sea, but consumer goods ""will face the largest impact"", according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, though he does note the current disruption has occurred ""during the off-peak shipping season"". Delays to products reaching shops can be expected, due to the Cape of Good Hope route adding about 3,500 nautical miles. Furniture giant Ikea and UK retailer Next have both warned that supplies of products could be delayed if disruption to shipping continues. Tesla has suspended manufacturing at its only European electric car factory due to supplies being disrupted. The extra distance will also cost companies more. According to supply chain advisers Drewry, the price of using a 40ft container has risen by 15% in the past week. These extra costs could be passed on by businesses to customers. However, container rates are still far below the levels seen in 2021, when freight charges soared in line with demand as Covid restrictions were eased. There are also fears the disruption could push up oil prices. A rise in oil prices, a key ingredient in car fuel, can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%. When it comes to shipments of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) being disrupted, even if wholesale energy prices rise, any increases would not feed through to domestic bills until April 2024 at the earliest. This is because the energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, has already been set for January. Is moving freight by sea the only option? Mr Rogers says transporting goods by rail instead would require ""crossing Russia"", which is under economic sanctions due to invading Ukraine, while ""trucking from the Gulf to Israel may only offset around 3% of shipping"". The US had launched an international naval operation in December to try to protect ships on the Red Sea route. This operation was joined by countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain, but some shipping companies remained reluctant to start using the route again. Maersk resumed shipments through the Red Sea briefly following the introduction of the security operation, but paused sailings again after one of its container ships came under attack. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen. ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" US President Joe Biden said.

"Oxfordshire weekly round-up: 22-28 October 2023",NA,2023-10-29,"Patrick Stewart surprising a bookseller by signing copies of his new memoir was among our most read stories this week in Oxfordshire. A variety of local issues featured on the BBC News website, BBC Radio Oxford and South Today. We have picked five stories to keep you up to date. A bookseller says she was ""delighted"" when Sir Patrick Stewart made a surprise appearance to sign copies of his new book. The actor dropped into The Woodstock Bookshop when he saw copies of his memoir in the window. Merle Esson told the BBC it was ""very generous and supportive"" of Sir Patrick to drop in. An Oxford pub that was frequented by authors CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien has been bought by a research institution building a campus in the city. The Ellison Institute of Technology, founded by US tech billionaire Larry Ellison, said it had bought the Eagle and Child, which shut in 2020, and would ""refurbish and reopen the iconic venue"". The pub, in St Giles', dates back to 1650 and has a plaque inside commemorating the writers' get-togethers. Air pollution in cities around the world has been recreated in an art installation that allows people to experience the air quality at each location. The work by artist Michael Pinsky has been touring the UK as part of a four-year research project designed to raise awareness about air pollution. The pods have been installed at St John’s College in Oxford. Labour has lost its majority on Oxford City Council after a ninth councillor resigned from the party. Councillor Barbara Coyne is the latest to leave in protest against Labour's stance on the Israel-Hamas war. The eight councillors who have already stepped down say Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer needs to call for a ceasefire. Controversial speed bumps installed in roadworks have been removed after complaints from drivers. Motorists told BBC Radio Oxford the four ""giant"" bumps along the A4130 in Didcot risked damaging their vehicles. Councillor Ian Snowdon, from Oxfordshire County Council, said he had received a number of complaints from residents since they were installed last week. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

"Glyndebourne opera disrupted by Just Stop Oil protest","By Tanya Gupta",2023-06-16,"Three Just Stop Oil protesters disrupted a performance at Glyndebourne on Thursday, the opera house has said. The protesters let off a confetti bomb, blew an air horn and started shouting during a show at the Sussex venue. A Glyndebourne spokeswoman said the incident was reported to the police, but officers did not attend and no arrests were made. The stage was cleared and ushers peacefully escorted the protesters from the theatre within a minute, she said. The audience remained inside and was given regular updates. A video posted on Twitter showed the protest greeted by booing and slow claps. ""We are very sorry to everyone whose visit to Glyndebourne was affected by the protest action today,"" the spokeswoman said on Thursday night. ""Our highest priority was the safety and security of everyone on site and we would like to thank our staff and performers, whose calm and professional response kept everyone safe and disruption to a minimum."" The disruption occurred at about 17:30 BST during a performance of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites. The opera restarted after a delay of about 20 minutes. In a statement, Just Stop Oil said it was ""calling on everyone to get off the side lines and join in civil resistance against new oil, gas and coal"". Sussex Police said it received a report of a disturbance at the opera performance shortly before 17:30 ""Three protesters were safely escorted from the venue by staff there,"" the force said. Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact police. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram. Send your story ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Highlands and Islands: Rural backwater to industrial powerhouse","By Douglas Fraser",2023-09-02,"It's the size of Belgium, they tell you, though the similarities stop around there. Much of the region has sparse population and is designated 'less favoured area' for the quality of its agricultural land. However, it's more favoured for its tourism appeal, in an industry given booster rockets by the power of Instagram. It has many of Scotland's most important food and drink successes, and many more of its answers to the climate emergency. The Highlands and Islands economy has long been seen as a drain of people and talent, or an expensive drain on funds. But that has changed, and the region is on the cusp of changing much faster, as a renewable powerhouse for the UK and beyond, and even as a launchpad for space. That potential was reflected in the next five-year strategy for Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), published this week. It's not long after the first anniversary of my move from Glasgow to the Black Isle, so it has had me reflecting on what I've learned since that flit. The HIE strategy reflects changes afoot in the economy - space launchpads, marine bio-technology, more potential for the creative industries. Not only does the agency see Net Zero as an opportunity, it plans to make a credible commitment to reducing emissions as a condition for support to a business client. But the Scottish government's economic agency is coy and reticent about the most contentious political issue for the area, of transport. ""Major transport and digital connectivity improvements have been made over past decades and the region is well-connected, but there is room for improvement,"" it understates. In the northern isles, the inter-island ferries are in need of replacement, and islanders are asking why more of the bill isn't picked up at national level. It's no coincidence that Orcadians have been wondering out loud if they might be better off as part of Norway. Shetland has a bold plan for tunnels to replace several ferries. If the Faroes can, why not? The problems of the CalMac ferry fleet to the west are widely known - an ageing fleet, huge problems with replacement vessels, far too many cancelled services and, with fares reduced to match the equivalent cost of road travel, demand outstrips capacity for much of the summer. Rail services are little faster than taking the car. The Scottish government says it intends to electrify the main line between Perth and Inverness by 2035. That target, set in 2020, is a reminder of the one for dualling the A9 road between the two cities. It never had a credible plan, the target has slipped so far that it's been abandoned and we should hear of a new target soon. This time, it could even be backed by action. The A9 gets a lot of the attention, as a vital corridor. But the bottlenecks and road design are worse on the A82 along Loch Lomond-side, which is a vital connection for Lochaber. There are repeated landslips blocking the A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll. That is not a remote Highland road as some might suppose. It's the vital artery for the economy of most of Argyll, through Invererary, Lochgilphead and on to Campbeltown. The A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen, an important link for agriculture, distillers, tourism and the energy sector, is also crying out for more capacity and bypasses. The case for improved transport infrastructure is there for all to see. It has come in waves. Most Highland settlements grew up around railway stations. Anyone who recalls the tortuous A9 road between Perth and Inverness before 1975 or so - bottlenecked through villages and corkscrewing under rail bridges - will be aware what a huge improvement and difference it made to opening up the Highland capital for economic development. Even clearer was the impact of three bridges to open up the Moray Firth area north of Inverness. The Kessock bridge from the city to the Black Isle transformed the peninsula (no, it's not an isle). At its furthest point east, Cromarty was becoming derelict in the 1970s, and is now an architectural and cultural gem. The Cromarty bridge bypassed Dingwall and opened up the possibilities for Easter Ross, and a further bridge across the Dornoch Firth brought Sutherland into the Inverness travel-to-work region. David Bell, an economics professor who retired from Stirling University to return to his Dornoch roots two years ago, says those bridges were ""visionary"". He adds that the case for improved A9 should be extended north of Inverness as energy traffic comes to Easter Ross. It's not all about the Inverness area. A big part of the Highlands and Islands success story of the past 50 years flowed from European structural funds. Bridges and causeways brought life back to the Outer Hebridean islands of Scalpay, Berneray, Vatersay and Eriskay. The funds helped build the fibre infrastructure that linked eight colleges into the University of the Highlands and Islands. That has helped some stay at home to be educated and upskilled - if they can secure and afford homes. But it would be wrong to say that has reversed the brain drain of young people from the region. The bright lights of central belt cities and their universities still shine more brightly. One of the more significant challenges faced by the north and west now is a rapid demographic tilt away from families and towards retirees. School rolls are projected to fall steeply, changing the nature of the economy and putting pressure on other public services including health and social care. Local politicians have recently begun a campaign to replace Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, aware it's unlikely during their careers. But further centralisation of services is a big issue in more remote west coast communities. Skye has seen a long campaign to retain services in the north of the island. If you're not familiar with the island, it's probably bigger than you think, the moreso if you need medical help in a hurry. The list of challenges goes on. I haven't mentioned uncertainty around farming subsidies and potential no-fishing zones, or the pressure on roads and services from the marketing success of the North Coast 500. But the list of opportunities has been growing fast too. The HIE report highlights the relatively high level of high growth companies and (at least female) entrepreneurial activity. Although the area has many of the not-spots for broadband and mobile connectivity, where it works, it transforms possibilities for remote working and for delivery of public services. And the biggest prospect is energy. A recent study by the Institute of Fiscal Studies showed that falling income from oil and gas has hit the north of Scotland harder than other parts. That's not just Aberdeen, the north-east and Shetland, but across the Highlands and Islands. Numerous small communities have been sustained for decades by good earnings from offshore work. The 'just transition' being promised for those workers with the move to renewable power has its sceptics. It doesn't look like the jobs bonanza that oil brought, or at least not the pay bonanza that came with those jobs. But there's world leadership on tidal power in the Pentland Firth, Shetland and Islay, pumped-storage hydro being expanded at Ben Cruachan and around Loch Ness, perhaps eventually wave power from its research base on Orkney and, yes, even the installation of two solar arrays in Moray. The biggest prospect is in wind power - 're-powering' older onshore turbines with much taller, more powerful designs - and ScotWind. The scale of it could be colossal, in 17 sea areas installing hundreds of vast turbines, some on platforms, but many floating and anchored to the seabed, using technologies which open up vast new areas of the sea. Developers have paid nearly £800m for the right to develop, and if the pricing incentives and cost of finance align, they could be building out capacity - in this round of development alone - of more than three times the usual power demand from Scottish customers. Like the oil and gas industry, most of this will be over the horizon. Also like fossil fuels, many of the jobs will be in onshore engineering and support. The Green Freeport status secured by Cromarty Firth and Inverness is still taking shape, but could bring very significant industrialisation to the area. Nigg is ready for such work, and there are plans for a large cable factory on adjacent land. But much more capacity for assembling offshore equipment is required. In Wester Ross, another former oil platform fabrication yard at Loch Kishorn is back in action. At Ardersier near Inverness, an area the size of 300 football pitches is being cleared and a deep quayside installed. That £300m US investment in the new company in charge there, Hiventus, is merely a down-payment. Far more is expected on the site, including manufacturing. The big aim remains a factory for the high-skilled jobs in making blades. It's a reminder, raised also by Professor David Bell, of one of the bigger challenges for this and other business development: the importance of ready access to capital. Unlike oil and gas, there's a big challenge from the renewable power expansion in getting power to the customer. Some will draw industries into the region for local use, with the biggest potential for cracking water to isolate burnable hydrogen. Big international markets are opening up for hydrogen as an industrial fuel to replace oil and gas. Pipelines and shipping terminals will be required. For homes and businesses in the central belt, England and beyond, some power will go through subsea cables, but much of it will be on high pylons, which are meeting fierce opposition in the Highlands as well as points further south. So a year after moving to the Black Isle, what are my reflections? It's a fantastic place to live, for quality of life and strong communities. There are worries and pressures in common with other parts of the country, but there is a confidence in the air. These are good times for the Highlands and Islands. The challenges of transport and housing stem from the prospects for growth, rather than depopulation and decline that characterised the area before the 1960s. When I look at the scale of what is coming from the Great Energy Transition, I wonder if Highlanders and islanders are yet aware how much that could industrialise these largely rural areas, and move them from the periphery to the heart of the new economy.

"Just Stop Oil: Dartford Crossing protesters lose bid to reduce sentences","By Kate Scotter and Sian Harrison",2023-07-31,"Two Just Stop Oil activists who scaled the Dartford Crossing bridge have lost their Court of Appeal bid for reduced sentences. Morgan Trowland, 40, and Marcus Decker, 34, were suspended over the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge for about 37 hours. Trowland was jailed for three years, and Decker for two years and seven months, following a trial. Their appeals were rejected by three senior judges, who said the sentences were ""not excessive"". At a hearing in London last week, the protesters' lawyers made a bid to challenge the ""extraordinary length"" of Trowland's three-year sentence and Decker's jail term of two years and seven months. But Lady Justice Sue Carr, sitting with Mrs Justice Johanna Cutts and Mrs Justice Justine Thornton, said: ""This was very serious offending by repeat protest offenders who were trespassers and on bail at the time. ""Whilst the protest was non-violent as such, it had extreme consequences for many, many members of the public."" The judges acknowledged the ""long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds"" and that the sentences handed to Trowland and Decker went ""well beyond previous sentences imposed for this type of offending"". But Lady Justice Carr said the jail terms reflected ""Parliament's will"" under new laws enacted under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act last year which introduced a new ""fault-based public nuisance offence for what obviously will include non-violent protest behaviour, with a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment"". Structural engineer Trowland, of Islington in north London, and Decker, a private tutor of no fixed address, climbed the bridge's cables at about 04:00 BST on 17 October and were eventually brought down using a cherry picker crane at about 17:30 the following day. The southbound A282, the designation for the road on the bridge as it connects the M25 motorway between Essex and Kent, was reopened at about 21:00 - 41 hours after the demonstration began. In April, a jury at Basildon Crown Court found them guilty of causing a public nuisance by a unanimous verdict. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Got a story?

"Freeports go Forth and multiply","By Douglas Fraser",2023-11-28,"The idea of a ""just transition"" from fossil fuels to renewable ones is coming under uncomfortable scrutiny. As PetroIneos pulls out of refining oil at Grangemouth, it doesn't seem that ""just"" for around 400 people losing their jobs. They can reasonably ask if the transition, for them, is just rhetoric or just around the corner. And around 90,000 others with livelihoods dependent on the oil and gas industry will be looking on nervously. If Scotland's only refinery closes and becomes a terminal for imported fuels, a vital element in the pipework of the industry is being removed. Nobody in the sector can feel as safe after that. Whether it's just or even a transition, there is reason to hope. Renewable energy is growing and is set to grow much faster, as the vast ScotWind offshore projects take shape and ramp up activity. Two focuses for that optimism are the green freeports - one chosen on the Cromarty Firth and Inverness, the other on several locations around the Firth of Forth. The idea is to have designated land for industrial development, with low taxes on property and employment, and no customs tariffs for in- or outbound trade. The Scottish variety is meant to be focused on renewable energy and low carbon enterprise. There is also pressure to ensure they don't become a magnet for employers with a low-wage business model, which is how freeports tend to turn out in other parts of the world. They've been a long time coming.  A long bidding process reached that winning selection in January. While England has freeports up and running (and is already facing claims of fraud in at least one), more than 10 months later in Scotland, we now have at least an outline of the Outline Business Case for both zones in Scotland. The Highland one laid out the plan for councillors to see, so we were all able to take a peek: 10,000 jobs, £3.5bn investment over 25 years, while diverting National Insurance payments into a large training fund. At Inverness Chamber of Commerce, they're optimistic, but the recurring concerns are about where those 10,000 people are to come from, how can they be adequately skilled up, and if they can be recruited, where is the housing for them, and the transport infrastructure for them to use? There are more urban versions of those for the Forth green freeport, which this week issued an outline of its Outline Business Case. We don't get to see the whole document until the outline business case becomes the final variety. Although the Highland and Forth bids have won, they still have to negotiate the terms with the Treasury and the Scottish government. That will take further months to conclude. The big Firth of Forth numbers are around 19,000 direct jobs inside the green freeport zones, and a further 19,350 jobs resulting from activity in these zones, but not directly employed inside them. The plan has expanded to include part of the Rosyth dockyard owned and controlled by the Royal Navy, which has duly become a partner. Burntisland docks in Fife are also seen as expanding the role initially envisaged for them of being a customs-free zone. These could now become a low-tax zone for manufacturing for the offshore wind industry. The bigger players are at Leith Docks and Grangemouth, with a customs-free zone at Edinburgh Airport. That takes us back to the plight of the vast refinery and petro-chemicals complex in Falkirk Council area. Ineos is a partner in the Forth Green Freeport project. With Sir Jim Ratcliffe having homes in Monaco and Switzerland as well as England, and with his holding company based in Luxembourg, Ineos is adept at working tax regimes to its advantage. The boundary line of the Forth Green Freeport zone is designed to cut out the Grangemouth refinery and much of the oil and gas processing works, instead including parts of the site designated for low-tax development of hydrogen production and biofuels. There is a race on to get to five biofuel plants in the UK by 2025 making SAF, or sustainable aviation fuel. On Tuesday, from Heathrow to New York, Virgin Atlantic pioneer the first transatlantic airliner flight powered entirely by SAF, which is made from agricultural waste and used cooking oil. A tiny part of aviation fuel so far, it is seen as the best way of taking carbon out of flying. On the north bank of the Forth, Rosyth and its main operator, Babcock, have hopes of greener modular shipbuilding, so there may also be more than a touch of battleship grey to the freeport colour scheme. At Leith Docks, Forth Ports is clearing space and strengthening the quayside to accommodate the very large barges required for carrying offshore wind turbines. The intention overall is to get £7bn of investment from public and private sources, to create £8.5bn of value added to the Scottish economy. You could say that it is going Forth and applying an economic multiplier… but maybe it's best not to. Atop this, a new chairwoman has just been appointed to oversee the project. Dame Susan Rice brings blue chip credentials, having been the first woman chief executive of a British bank as well as chairwoman   of Lloyds TSB Bank, she was initial chair of the Scottish Fiscal Commission, a board member of SSE, Sainsbury's and the Bank of England, and she is currently chair of Scottish Water.

"England cricket team delayed by Just Stop Oil road block",NA,2023-06-01,"The Test match summer got off to a frustrating start for England's cricketers when the team bus was held up on its way to Lord's by Just Stop Oil activists. The protest briefly blocked the team bus in Kensington Gore in central London at about 8:30 BST. It cleared quickly and did not cause any significant delay to the team’s journey. Wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow posted a photo on Instagram showing Just Stop Oil protesters and police in the road in front of the team bus. Bairstow’s caption read: “If we’re a bit late it’s not our fault.” The campaign group said that about 50 protesters had taken to the roads around Hyde Park and Battersea Park. One protester taking action was Alice Tulissio, a 21-year-old student from Falmouth, who said: “I am marching with Just Stop Oil today because I want a future.""  She added: ""We are heading towards climate catastrophe and the UK government is knowingly speeding this up by licensing over 100 new oil, gas and coal projects. This will ultimately be a death sentence to us all. “I understand it’s frustrating to those on the road who are disrupted by marches, but it has gotten to the point where this is the only way the government will listen to us."" Just Stop Oil says further marches are expected later on Thursday. The group has been protesting in London's roads six days a week since 24 April.

"Police to be given clearer powers on slow-walk protests","By Joshua Nevett",2023-06-13,"Police in England and Wales are to be given clearer powers to stop protests deemed to be seriously disruptive, in a law approved by Parliament. The House of Lords voted through the new regulations, despite an attempt to block them by an opposition peer. The new law gives officers more leeway to intervene when protesters attempt to block roads with slow marching. The tactic has been used by protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain. The new law follows last month's passage of the Public Order Act, legislation designed to beef up police powers to clamp down on protests judged to be disruptive. The government says the new regulations are needed because the police lack clarity on when their existing powers can be used. The regulations lower the threshold for what kind of protest activity is considered ""serious disruption"". Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the impact of ""disruptors"" from certain protest groups had been ""huge"" and ""the police must be able to stop this happening"". But critics have branded the new measures an attack on the right to protest and argue that the police are already capable of stopping slow-walking demonstrations under current laws. The regulations were backed by MPs in a vote on Monday, with 277 in favour and 217 against. In the House of Lords on Tuesday, some opposition peers tried some parliamentary manoeuvres to prevent the regulations from becoming law. Ministers had already tried to ban slow-walking protests by adding measures to the Public Order Act but were narrowly defeated by peers. Given this, Baroness Jones, a Green peer, had tabled a ""fatal motion"", which invited members to decline to approve the regulations because Parliament had already rejected them. Urging peers to back her motion, Baroness Jones said this was an ""authoritarian law that hands power to decide what is a good protest or a bad protest over to the police and the Home Office"". She said the law was ""being enacted in an authoritarian manner by ministerial decree"". Home Office minister Lord Sharpe called the baroness' motion ""highly unusual"", arguing it sought ""to strike down legislation passed by the elected House and undermine sensible changes, which bring clarity and consistency to the law"". The baroness' motion was not successful, with peers voting against it by 68 votes to 154, a majority of 86. While peers condemned the government's actions in bringing back regulations that had been previously rejected by peers in primary legislation, Labour did not support the fatal motion, because of a convention to accept the will of the elected House of Commons. A few minutes earlier, peers had backed a Labour ""regret motion"" - which set out criticisms of the regulations but did not block them - by 177 votes to 141. Police have been under a lot of pressure from politicians over how they handle protests with recent actions by Just Stop Oil. But the powers given to police in the Public Order Act were criticised as too crude and too broad, following the arrest of anti-monarchy protesters on the day of King Charles's Coronation. The 2023 Public Order Act is the government's second major piece of legislation changing protest laws in under two years. In 2022, MPs voted to place greater restrictions on public processions if they were too noisy. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Firm finds increased fat and waste in sewers",NA,2023-06-28,"Jersey's sewage treatment plant is making changes to deal with the amount of fat and waste coming through it. It comes as bosses pleaded with householders and restaurateurs to be careful about what they put down the drain. Experts said grease and oils being put down the sink, and people flushing wet wipes and sanitary products, were partly to blame for an issue at the plant - which led to the closure of St Aubin's Bay. People were told not to swim there, due to high levels of harmful bacteria being found in outflow water. Duncan Berry, head of Liquid Waste, said the firm was ""pleading"" with householders to dispose of fats in the solid waste. ""We'd ask everyone doing any cooking or anything please don't put it [fats] down the drains, please clean your pans out and put it in the solid waste rather than down the sink."" He said that restaurateurs could also have their excess oil collected. But it was not just the oils said to be causing problems with the sewage systems. ""We do have other issues such as solids coming down the sewers from ear buds to sanitary towels and a lot of wet wipes that cause blockages to pumps,"" he added. Mr Berry said the government-owned firm was investigating where the high levels of fat, oil, grease and ammonia were coming from but suspected households and restaurants were responsible. He added that they were ""tweaking"" some of their pump systems to ""improve performance"". Follow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook. Send your story ideas to channel.islands@bbc.co.uk.

"Kuenssberg: New year, new tactics but old problems for Sunak","By Laura Kuenssberg",2024-01-06,"Detail matters. Decisions matter. Rishi Sunak's every action as prime minister shapes public opinion about him in this crucial general election year, when you'll have your say on his performance. We'll explore this more in our interview with him on Sunday. But perhaps the biggest factor in his success or failure is much harder for him to get his hands around. There is a sense in every nook and cranny of Westminster that changing the mood is almost impossible, given how many things have gone wrong. A view that decline has taken hold is most definitely in fashion. That is what the polls and newspaper columns say - and so, privately, do many MPs. And with yet another Tory MP walking away - this time former minister Chris Skidmore - it's almost as if Conservative MPs are carrying out their own painful slow motion general election by creating by-election after by-election after by-election. Losing heart, or leaving in disgrace. How then is Mr Sunak going to try to turn you back to his party? This isn't going to be a year of big new plans or policies from Number 10, insiders say. That all happened last year - the next few months is about hoping they'll have the desired results. The obvious big exception is the plan to send migrants to Rwanda, which is still miles from happening, and faces more political and legal battles. It is an even trickier sell now we know more about Mr Sunak's own doubts at the start of the scheme. But the 2024 election warmup plan will feature the prime minister on the road much more - three times a week I'm told - meeting as many voters as possible face to face, and telling the story of the progress he believes he is making. This is yet another change of approach. At the start there was stop-the-chaos reasonable Rishi, then the ""real Rishi"", then ""I'm the change Rishi"", and there will now be ""Rishi on the road"". Will it have an effect? Mr Sunak's personal ratings got worse when the public began to see more of him after he entered Number 10 - so there is nothing obvious that suggests the public seeing even more of him will help. What will the message be? Conservative MPs gave me some helpful, and less helpful, suggestions: The message you will actually hear will be more and more pointed towards Sunak's Labour opponents. When we speak to Rishi Sunak on Sunday, I expect the slogan we will hear is ""don't risk it"" -  urging voters not to take a chance on the Labour Party. That's not exactly a revolutionary sentiment from a Conservative government trying to hang on to power. But given the public mood, and the number of big problems the government has to face, promising the earth might just not be credible. Conservatives are often unimpressed with Keir Starmer, and frequently grateful he is their opponent. But many of them share his description of the public mood. He said this week there was a sense that politics just doesn't work anymore. That the country is ""exhausted, tired, despairing"" and that ""nobody believes you can make a difference"". If you are, like me, a proud political anorak, that might have rung a bell. Once upon a time there was another opposition leader, who had spent a few years in charge trying to shake up his party after it had been out of power for 13 years. This leader opened their party's manifesto with the following lines: ''People have lost faith that politics can fix our problems, or that politicians can lead us into a better future. There is a feeling of helplessness. Once again, there is a mood afoot that the decline of Britain is inevitable."" I doubt Keir Starmer would enjoy the comparison, but his words were remarkably similar to the start of David Cameron's 2010 Tory manifesto. The core problem for then-PM Gordon Brown was that Labour, after changing prime minister, seemed exhausted after 13 years in charge. Out of ideas, and scarred by its own vendettas and personal battles. There had been a terrible emergency, the financial crash, and the government seemed ill-equipped to meet the challenges people faced. And there was an opposition leader who seemed a reasonable sort of chap to most members of the public, determined to make the most of that opportunity to offer the elusive ""change"". Sound familiar? Don't forget the inevitable but critically important caveats. Eleven months in politics is an absolute age. (If you fancy taking a punt, 14 November is not a bad bet for the general election as things stand. But do not, under any circumstances, hold me to that. So much could change. Rishi Sunak also absolutely did not rule out a spring election this week.) Voters are volatile and you'd need your head read to make any solid predictions at this stage. Back at our 2010 parallel - David Cameron failed to win outright. And Labour needs to overturn more seats than Lord Cameron to get the same result. And while Labour's lead in the polls is huge, for now, there are hordes of voters still undecided. But even Tory election chiefs are saying their path to victory is ""steep and narrow"". As one final Conservative MP's slogan suggested: ""The only way is up"". After the woes of 2023, the prime minister who wants to win a historic fifth term for his party will hope that proves to be true. What questions would you like to ask the prime minister this Sunday?

"Star Wars, sloths and sweaters in London's year in pictures","By Bethan Bell",2023-12-26,"As 2023 draws to a close, what images represent your experience of London over the past 12 months? Memorable events might include the coronation of the King or Just Stop Oil protesters throwing orange paint at a flower show. Or perhaps London's New Year's Eve fireworks display that people attended for the first time since the pandemic? BBC London has selected a ""picture of the day"" representing each month, as published on its Instagram account. So here, we look back at images from the capital from January to December. London Zoo released an image of a baby two-toed sloth which was born on New Year's Day. Zoo sloth keeper Veronica Heldt said: ""We were delighted to finally spot a tiny baby exactly where it should be, clinging on to its mother's tummy. ""We've nicknamed the little one Nova, which means 'new' in Latin, as we couldn't have asked for a better start to the new year."" Fun fact: To accommodate their upside-down lifestyle, sloths are the only mammals whose hair grows upwards - it parts in the middle of the belly and grows upward toward the back. The hair on the face points upward too. This allows water to run off during rainstorms. On 6 February 2023 an earthquake struck southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria. There was widespread damage and tens of thousands of fatalities. London has thriving Turkish, Kurdish and Syrian communities that were severely affected and many Londoners were quick to rally to support rescue efforts. For the first time, London's West End was lit with 30,000 lights to mark the holy month of Ramadan. The lights were switched on by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who is one of the 1.3 million Muslims in London who celebrate the event. The original BBC London caption for this picture - of a Star Wars fan dressed as an Imperial Death Trooper arriving at the ExCeL convention centre - was ""Why use an Oyster card when you can use the force?"" To which someone immediately replied: ""It's unlikely that an Empire trooper would be force sensitive."" Which BBC London, sadly, did not respond with: ""I find your lack of faith disturbing."" To celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III, a giant 16ft replica of St Edward's Crown was set up near Marble Arch. The huge hat weighed 300kg and featured 36 different coloured glass stones. It also lit up at night - much like King Charles's crown, which he uses after nightfall to light his way through the 775-room Buckingham Palace. Probably. The HMT Empire Windrush, carrying passengers from the Caribbean to the UK, docked on 22 June 75 years ago. Windrush Day was marked with live coverage from the BBC, a national commemoration service was held at Southwark Cathedral, and a celebratory procession paraded from Herne Hill to Brixton. The Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election, triggered by Boris Johnson's resignation, prompted this picture of a Very Good Boy. Every election period animal welfare charity Blue Cross gamely fields questions about pets and polling stations, including: Can my dog vote for me? (No). Can I ask my dog who they think I should vote for? (Yes). Does my dog get a vote? (No). And as a bonus, here are some more pictures of dogs outside polling stations. Football almost came home in August as the Lionesses carried the hopes of English fans at the Women's World Cup. The Welsh Guards Band and their instruments got involved in the semi-final, in which England beat Australia 3-1. Ultimately, though, football must have forgotten its ticket back. It stayed away as the Lionesses lost 1-0 to Spain in the final. September saw the one-year anniversary of the Queen's death. Gun salutes were fired in cities across Britain and the bells of Westminster Abbey echoed across London. Well-wishers left tributes and flowers at Buckingham Palace. Don't drop it - the world's most valuable whisky, with an estimated value of £750,000 to £1.2m, was paraded before the cameras ahead of an auction at Sotheby's. That valuation, though, was nonsense. The drink sold for £2.1m - almost twice as much as its highest estimate. Christmas seems to start earlier and earlier every year. This year it started in the late Cretaceous period - 66 to 90 million years ago, with the T-Rex at the Natural History Museum donning a traditional prehistoric jumper. To say something is ""copper-bottomed"" means that it is entirely reliable, while ""copper topped"" indicates a person with auburn hair. The soon-to-be museum of London, with its shiny copper-clad roof, is neither - but has been described by London's mayor Sadiq Khan as ""a major landmark that will be a jewel in our crown"". Which sounds better than either. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"Prevent: Rise in climate activists referred to anti-terror scheme","By Joshua Nevett",2023-12-23,"The number of climate activists referred to the Prevent anti-terrorism programme has increased following the emergence of disruptive environmental protests, the BBC has learned. The UK government's Prevent scheme aims to stop people becoming terrorists. Critics say Prevent curbs human rights by stifling non-violent political beliefs and should be reformed. The government says it has never advised referring people to Prevent for lawful climate activism or protest. Anyone can contact the police or a local authority to make a Prevent referral, which usually involves filling out a form to explain a concern about someone deemed to be at risk of radicalisation. Since 2015, institutions including schools, universities, hospitals, local authorities, police, and prisons have had a legal duty to consider the risk of radicalisation. The Home Office told the BBC Prevent interventions were legitimate for those who could be radicalised into terrorism in the name of environmental causes. But climate activists say the government's definition of extremism is too broad and authorities are confusing extremism with non-violent civil disobedience in too many cases. Sir Peter Fahy, a former national police lead for Prevent, said it was ""inappropriate"" to treat non-violent climate activists as potential terrorists. He said the fear of being flagged to police in a Prevent referral could deter people from protesting, and argued the rise in environmental cases reasons ""shows how confused we've become about all of this"". ""Prevent has been and should be about people who want to take their extremism into violent action,"" Sir Peter said. Prevent has mainly focused on Islamist and far-right terrorism but it does try to counter other types of extremism. The government groups ""eco-terrorism"" in a category of violent extremism motivated by ideas on ""the extreme political left-wing"". It says although this category does not represent a significant threat, some activity has met a terrorist threshold in recent years and security services continue to investigate such cases. There have been ""a small number of instances of terrorist behaviour that have been motivated by an environmentalist ideology"", the Home Office said. In response to a freedom of information request, the UK's police chiefs told the BBC there were 32 Prevent referrals for ""Left Wing - Environmental"" reasons between 2015 and 2022. There was a notable spike in referrals in 2019, when Extinction Rebellion - a climate group known for its disruptive protests - came to prominence with large demonstrations in the UK and internationally. The BBC has spoken to one climate activist who was assessed by Prevent. They said they did not wish to be named in this report because they feared they would lose their job. The climate activist was referred to Prevent by their employer after being arrested at an Extinction Rebellion protest. The person has been cautioned by police and convicted for public order offences committed at disruptive environmental protests. The BBC has seen a copy of the form used to refer the climate activist to Prevent. The form says they were referred ""due to being a member of Extinction Rebellion and other splinter groups"". The form says the groups ""are not considered extreme in themselves, but individuals within them may hold extremist views"". The climate activist was assessed by a multi-agency safeguarding team and they said no further action was taken. When people are referred to Prevent, the police decide whether or not they need more comprehensive intervention through a process called Channel. The Home Office said there were fewer than 10 referrals for environmental reasons each year between 2015 and 2022, but refused to release specific figures, citing safety and privacy concerns. The number of Prevent referrals adopted as Channel cases for all reasons is relatively small every year, representing 9% of the total in 2022-23. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Lawful protest or activism does not meet the threshold for Prevent referrals and at no point has the government advised referring people simply for climate activism. ""Prevent is an early intervention programme which seeks to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism, regardless of the ideology. If a person is not at risk of radicalisation then their case will be closed to Prevent."" A controversial strand of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy, Prevent was set up by Tony Blair's government in the 2003 following the 9/11 attacks. A key moment in its evolution came in 2015, with the introduction of the legal duty on schools and other institutions to report those deemed at risk of radicalisation. Human rights activists have long accused Prevent of demonising Muslims, and having a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Earlier this year, Amnesty International urged the UK government to scrap the Prevent duty in a report condemning its impact on human rights. ""People are being referred to Prevent for non-violent political beliefs,"" said Ilyas Nagdee, Amnesty International UK's racial justice director. But Lord Carlile, who reviewed the scheme for the government in 2011, said environmental protesters who ""presented as potentially violent extremists are properly referable to Prevent"". He said there was a ""superficiality to analysis based on numbers and on descriptions as brief as 'environmental activist' without looking at the context"" of each referral. Lord Carlile said while the programme could be improved, he did not agree with those who argued it should be scrapped because ""some environmental activists were allegedly drawn into Prevent"". He said counter-terrorism was ""not science"" and ""the police have a very difficult job"", arguing: ""You can't just write off Prevent because there have been some mistakes, any more than you can write off the police for arresting people who later are not charged."" Most referrals to Prevent are made in the education sector, where training to understand the risk of radicalisation is encouraged. In its Prevent report, Amnesty found some training materials listed environmental causes ""as potential forms of an ill-defined extremism that can lead to a referral"". Mat Osmond, who's a senior lecturer at Falmouth University in Cornwall, told the BBC his employer asked him to re-take Prevent training after he helped to organise a student Just Stop Oil talk on campus last year. He accepted he did not follow the university's Prevent procedures when booking a room. He said the training was about ""spotting the signs of radicalisation in students"" and had no relevance to room-booking procedures at his university. Outside work, Mr Osmond has been involved in climate activism himself. In October this year, he was found guilty of obstructing a road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest in London and was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge. When asked if he regretted his actions, Mr Osmond said he found obstructing ""random fellow citizens"" a ""deeply uncomfortable"" thing to do. But he said he would make ""a categorical distinction between being drawn into violent extremism"" and ""taking action with non-violent resistance campaigns"". David Knowles echoed this distinction. A former Prevent national lead within education, he had a significant role in the introduction of the legal duty in 2015. He said he didn't come across any environmental extremism when he was working in counter-terrorism. Mr Knowles said: ""Breaking the law doesn't mean you oppose democracy or the rule of law because, let's face it, lots of people in this country have protested and successfully changed the law. ""So people who might glue themselves to the road, to me, are not extremists."" But he said Prevent was a vital part of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy and should be allowed to continue to protect people ""from all forms of harm and risk"". ""Prevent is about safeguarding people away from extremism and terrorism, and it's not about supressing free speech at all,"" Mr Knowles said. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"What has Hungary's Orban got against Ukraine?","By Nick Thorpe",2023-12-15,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned he could ""pull the handbrake"" on future financial aid to Ukraine, after slapping a veto on a €50bn (£43bn; $55bn) EU package intended to help his neighbour survive the next three years. It's not the first time he has stood in the way of his European Union colleagues doing their best to help Kyiv through Russia's full-scale war. However, he did, grudgingly, let Ukraine and Moldova start formal negotiations on joining the EU, without actually supporting the idea. By walking out of the room he allowed the other 26 EU leaders vote for it unanimously. He still declared it a ""bad decision"" that Hungary could stop any time in the future. So what is Viktor Orban's problem with Ukraine? He argues his position is both pragmatic and constructive, although there is clearly personal antipathy between him and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. While other EU leaders queue up at the Brussels summit to have their photos taken with the Ukrainian leader, Mr Orban turns away. Last weekend, Mr Zelensky was locked in intense conversation with Mr Orban when the two men attended the inauguration of Argentina's new president. The Ukrainian president later said he had asked for one reason why Hungary was blocking Ukraine's EU membership. Mr Orban seems rather more at ease with Vladimir Putin than with Mr Zelensky, and is the Russian leader's closest ally in the EU. He has trodden a careful line in condemning Russia's invasion while steering clear of criticising its president, and recently became the first Western leader to meet him since April 2022. ""Hungary never wanted to confront Russia. Hungary always has been eager to expand contacts,"" Russian state TV quoted him as telling Mr Putin when they held talks in Beijing in October. Some reports suggested he even adopted Mr Putin's term for the war, ""military operation"". The sight of an EU and Nato leader shaking hands with Vladimir Putin angered Mr Orban's Western allies. The US ambassador to Budapest complained that while Russia was striking Ukrainian civilians, ""Hungary pleads for business deals"". Hungary's prime minister argues that Ukraine cannot win the war, and should therefore be persuaded by its allies to seek an immediate ceasefire, followed by negotiations. He warned during the summer that Ukraine's counter-offensive would fail, and in that he has been proved right. He has opposed EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas and refuses to allow EU or Nato military aid to enter Ukraine. He says supplying weapons to Kyiv just prolongs the agony. Mr Orban took the decision to veto the latest package of economic aid for Ukraine, because he says Hungarian taxpayers' money should not go against their own interests. He says membership for Ukraine in the EU would be a disaster for EU, including Hungarian farmers. It would also take away cohesion funds from Hungarians and others. He sees Ukraine not as a future EU member, but as a buffer-zone between the EU and Russia. It is a view not so different from Vladimir's Putin's vision of a ""neutral, demilitarised"" Ukraine. One senior Hungarian diplomat told the BBC that the conflict in Ukraine was ""an inter-Slav civil war"", illustrating a tendency in Mr Orban's governing Fidesz party to view the world in ethnic terms. Hungary has not been indifferent to the effects of Russia's invasion. It has provided considerable humanitarian aid and helped hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees on their way to other EU countries. Around 25,000 remain in Hungary and receive state support. But Mr Orban claims that history often proves him right. He points out that even his fiercest critics during the migration crisis of 2015-16 are now quietly adopting his policies, including building fences and trying to outsource asylum claims to countries outside Europe, including Rwanda, Libya and Tunisia. Another plank of his government's policy is support for Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries, including an estimated 100,000 in western Ukraine. Dozens of ethnic Hungarians have been killed or injured in battle, fighting for Ukraine. Thousands more have fled, or have not returned home from their jobs in the EU since the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. Since 2017, the Orban government has been at loggerheads with Kyiv over a Ukrainian education law which made it increasingly difficult to study Hungarian in Ukrainian schools. Playing tough, Mr Orban blocked meetings of the Nato-Ukraine commission. Ahead of this week's EU summit, Ukraine passed a new law guaranteeing the right of Hungarians and other ""EU nationalities"" to speak and study in their own languages. But the change was dismissed by the head of Hungary's governing Fidesz faction in Parliament, Mate Kocsis, as ""cosmetic and of little weight"". Unofficial estimates suggest only 50,000 ethnic Hungarians remain in Ukraine, and hostility towards them is growing. ""Every time Orban opens his mouth, our situation gets worse,"" one former supporter of the Hungarian prime minister's hard line told the BBC in Mukhachevo, a centre of Hungarians in the Transcarpathian province of Ukraine.

"The teenager who lives like it's the 1940s","By Jamie Russell",2023-12-08,"Callum Grubb is only 19 but he lives his life as if it is the 1940s. Nearly everything he owns is from the time period, including his clothes. The teenager drives a black 1938 Austin Cambridge, only uses a telephone from the 1940s, and rides a 1952 Raleigh bicycle. ""I joke to my friend, that it's gone beyond an obsession,"" he says. ""I'm as old-fashioned as they come."" Callum's car is 10 years older than his grandmother, Anne, who he has lived with at her home in Kirkcaldy, Fife, since he was 12. And while 75-year-old Anne regularly uses a mobile phone, her grandson does not even own one. ""I'm rubbish with technology,"" Callum says. ""I was forced to have a laptop for college, and I hated it."" Callum says he fell in love with the 40s during his first year of high school. ""I've always loved history,"" he says. ""When I was younger, I looked at my great grandad's prisoner-of-war diaries and I just love everything about the period."" He now collects everything related to the period, such as oil lamps and a vintage record player that he uses to listen to his favourites like Vera Lynn, Anne Shelton and Frank Sinatra. ""I couldn't tell you a modern singer if you asked me,"" he says. However, Callum told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme - via his 1940s Bakelite rotary-dial telephone - that there is one thing from the post-war period he definitely does not do. ""We don’t ration,” he says. “I like my food too much for that."" Callum's latest addition to his vintage collection is his car, a 1938 Austin Cambridge named Poppy. He had been saving up for the purchase since he was 13. ""Callum just came and told me, 'I want an old Austin',"" his mum Claire says. ""I didn't think it would ever happen."" He bought the car for £7,000 in early November from a man he met while visiting a museum. ""It has no seatbelts, but I absolutely love it,"" Callum says. He has the original invoice showing the car cost £215 in 1938, the equivalent of about £18,000 today. It is not illegal to drive a classic car without seatbelts - and Callum has driven his nearly every day since he got it. ""It's like you are back in time, especially when you get into the old country roads,"" he says. ""The car survived the blitz in London but it can only reach 50mph and even that is pushing it,"" Callum laughs. ""It's great to drive, there's always a clear road ahead but behind a sea of traffic. ""But folk don't tend to mind,"" he adds. Callum is regularly seen around Kirkcaldy in his car, and has become a local celebrity. He was even invited by a local bakery to park his car outside the front of their store for a grand-opening. ""People of all ages wave at the car, old and young alike,"" Callum says. But he regularly takes the car further afield than Kirkcaldy. ""We love to run along the coast in the old car, my friend Lynsey and I,"" he says. ""I usually stop at the antique shops along the way because it can be hard to get some of my clothes. ""My gran dreads me coming home because she knows I'll end up bringing something back with me."" Callum says people used to be shocked when he said he did not have a mobile phone. ""I keep very busy, I assure you,"" he says. He spends a lot of time with his car, maintaining and servicing it, even though it does not require an MOT or road tax, like all cars manufactured more than 40 years ago. When Callum isn't with his car, he's out with friends or working at the local dog kennels. He says he has friends of all ages, although he admits he shares more in common with people much older than him. ""I always get to chat to older people, they tell me they remember their dad or granddad with the car when they were my age,"" he says. Callum's gran, Anne Walker, says her house has become the epicentre for Callum's collections. ""I wake up to a picture of Winston Churchill and an old vintage car,"" she says. Callum has lived at his gran's house since he was 12, after his grandad, John, suddenly passed away. He's kept her company ever since. ""I've learned more about history from Callum, than I've ever known,"" the 75-year-old says. ""We always watch old films together, he's in love with Ginger Rogers,"" Anne says. Callum's mum, Claire, is a nursery officer at Fife Council, and says she has always supported his decision. ""Callum went away on a school trip when he was about 12 and came back with an old-fashioned hat on,"" she says. ""I thought it was funny, and I just asked him, 'Where did you find this?'. ""He said 'that's the way I want to dress, that's going to be me'. ""Ever since then, that's just been Callum,"" his mum says. Claire says that Callum is doing great, and she's watched him blossom into a 1940s gentlemen. Callum says he can't understand other people's fascination with his collection. ""You never think you're that interesting"" he says. ""This is just my life."" Callum says: ""A lot of these cars sit in a museum and are never used, but that's not what they're for, they're meant to be used. ""So that's what I'm doing. ""It's good to see the reaction, I always go by and beep the horn."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Ayodhya: Temple to open at India’s religious fault-line","By Yogita Limaye",2024-01-21,"Santosh Dubey says he has no regrets he helped tear down the mosque. ""It was religious work and I was put on this Earth to complete the task,"" he says. ""There is no crime or sin in it."" Mr Dubey, a ""kar sevak"" (religious worker), was one of tens of thousands of Hindu men who demolished the 16th Century Babri Masjid in the Indian holy city of Ayodhya on 6 December 1992. It was one of independent India's darkest days. The disputed site sits on one of its biggest religious fault-lines - thousands were killed in the violence that broke out. More than 30 years later, where the mosque once stood a grand temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities, is about to be opened by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That's controversial in a country with a secular constitution, but especially so because of the divisive history of the site. Monday's ceremony is being seen as the informal start of his campaign for re-election this year, wooing India's Hindu majority. Across the country, millions of Hindus are gearing up to celebrate the day like a big festival, while employees of Mr Modi's federal government have been given a half day. Sitting in his crumbling home, in a narrow alley in the city, paint and plaster peeling off its walls, Mr Dubey says he's proud of what he achieved. ""If we had not done what we did then the temple could never have been built,"" he says. ""Religious sentiments are greater than the constitution. I am extremely happy now. I had taken a pledge that I would not repair my home until Lord Ram got his."" But for Muslims, who make up India's biggest minority, the day will evoke fear and painful memories. Some will send their children out of the city, fearing tensions might be stoked when the streets fill with Hindu devotees from around the country. ""We have been betrayed once, so we feel fear,"" says Mohammad Shahid. ""Many outsiders will come into Ayodhya and it's when outsiders come that there's trouble."" 6 December 1992 was a defining moment in India's history. It was also a pivotal event in the political rise of the Hindu right-wing that's now seeking a third consecutive term in power. Many Hindus believe Muslim emperor Babur destroyed a temple that stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram and built a mosque over it more than 500 years ago. Santosh Dubey and dozens of others have faced charges and spent time in jail over the years, but no-one has been convicted for demolishing the mosque. He doesn't agree that what he did was against the law. ""Those who say that it was not Hindu to destroy the mosque are idiots. They are heretics, leftists, extremists and terrorists. ""We did not go to another country to destroy their places of worship, but if they destroyed ours, then it is right that we get them back."" Muslims regularly offered prayers in the mosque until 1949, when idols of Lord Ram were placed in it, allegedly by Hindu priests. The gates of the mosque were then closed by a court order. In 1986, they were re-opened, many believe at the behest of the Congress party, then in power, in a rumoured attempt to woo the Hindu majority. Then in 1990, the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - then just a small political party with little electoral success - spearheaded a mass campaign for a Hindu temple at the site. The campaign would later be seen as one of the key moments which transformed BJP into the virtually unbeatable political giant it is today, which now has Mr Modi at its head. That year, tens of thousands of kar sevaks congregated in Ayodhya. When they started moving towards the disputed site, police fired at them, killing dozens. ""Those bullets fuelled our anger,"" Santosh Dubey says. He was injured in the shooting. Two years later, kar sevaks gathered in Ayodhya again. ""The people who were guarding the disputed structure fled when they saw a huge crowd walking towards them with swords and hammers. We had practised everything earlier. We climbed on the domes and brought it down within a few hours."" Mr Dubey shows us a black and white photo that appeared in a newspaper of a group of men brandishing their weapons with raised arms, wide smiles on their faces. He says it was taken before the mosque was razed. ""We were happy, because we knew what was going to happen that day,"" he says, pointing to himself in the photo. For Ayodhya's Muslims it was a day of terror. ""Hundreds of thousands of men were all over Ayodhya. They had sticks, swords and tridents. Our house was surrounded by them,"" says Anwari Begum, now 65. ""We ran from our homes. I ran with my six-month-old baby and small children. My husband was running behind us. When I turned, I saw that he had been caught by some men. We had to keep running for our lives."" The next day she found out her husband Mohammad Amin had been killed, one of at least 17 Muslims who died in shocking violence in Ayodhya that day. ""An eyewitness told us that he had been caught, his arms and legs were chopped off, he was dumped into a sack and taken away. We never found his body,"" she says breaking down. When she returned to her home, she found it had been burnt to the ground. It would take time, but over the years the family would manage to rebuild a small, two-room home on the same site. ""My husband used to take care of our family. I was left alone with six small children. We got some money from the government but it was not enough. My life was destroyed by that day,"" she says. In the violence that swept across India after the mosque was torn down, nearly 2,000 people were killed. More than 900 died in the financial capital, Mumbai, alone, roughly two-thirds of them were Muslims.  There were killings in other cities including Jaipur, Bhopal, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. In Ayodhya, Mohammad Shahid's father Mohammad Sabir was also killed brutally. ""They beat him and then they poured oil on both him and my uncle and set them on fire. We found their bodies,"" he says. ""The country wants to forget what happened. But Muslims can never forget. It was a black day for us."" The family had a business supplying wooden carvings to temples in Ayodhya. The workshop was razed to the ground, and Mr Shahid was forced to become a rickshaw driver to earn a living. Like Mr Shahid, Anwari Begum wants her son Sohrab, who's in his 30s, to leave for his safety around the inauguration. ""I'm not scared, but I am nervous,"" he told the BBC. ""It's being said that 70,000 to 100,000 people are coming. The atmosphere could become charged, that's why Muslims are thinking of leaving. But I won't go. I don't think anything will happen."" In Ayodhya, the temple site is abuzz with cranes and diggers sending dust into the air ahead of the inauguration. Thousands of workers in hard hats dot the area. It's costing $217m (£170m) to build the temple, funded from private donations, the temple trust says. The makeover of the city is being done by the government, estimated to cost more than $3bn. Amid the construction, hundreds and hundreds of proud worshippers stream in to get a glimpse of the idols, with rituals for their consecration in the new temple already under way. Poonam Ohri, 40, had tears of joy rolling down her cheeks. ""Our dream has come true because of Modi and the BJP government. I am overwhelmed."" Badri Narayan, an elderly farmer who had travelled hundreds of miles, said his happiness knew no bounds. ""When I visited before, Lord Ram's idol was in a makeshift tent. It was getting wet in the rain. Tears started falling from my eyes seeing that,"" he told the BBC. ""And now he has been released because of Modi."" Prime Minister Modi has asked people not to come to Ayodhya on 22 January and to light a lamp in their homes. But he's also said everyone can visit from the next day. And it is those days following the official ceremony which worry some in the Muslim community. ""If the government reached out to us and gave assurances that nothing will happen, that would prevent people from leaving, but so far they haven't done that,"" said Azam Qadri, a Muslim community leader. Sohrab says ""political leaders should have come to us and said what happened to you was wrong - they should have showed compassion, but they have not"". As for the new temple that's being opened, he says: ""We feel happy they are building their temple, but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque."" Mohammad Shahid says Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site. ""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he says. After years in the courts, the disputed site was handed over to Hindus by a Supreme Court judgment in 2019, despite the judges also finding that the mosque's demolition had been illegal. The ruling relied on archaeological evidence which showed that features of the foundations of the mosque ""are suggestive of a Hindu religious origin"". It also said that evidence placed on the record proved that there was Hindu faith and belief that the site was the birthplace of Ram. It was not proved that a temple had been destroyed to build the mosque. The court also ordered a separate plot be given to Muslims to construct a mosque. It's 15 miles from Ayodhya, overgrown and empty. It is simply too far away, says Mr Qadri: ""If the government had given it as much attention by building roads and ring roads as it's doing for the temple, then work would have started there too."" Prime Minister Modi and the BJP are expected to sweep the general election later this year following the inauguration of the temple. Many accuse him and his party of violating the constitution, of turning a religious event into a state-sponsored one. But the BJP's local MP, Lallu Singh, saw no reason why Mr Modi shouldn't attend. ""If the prime minister is Hindu, why should he not visit the biggest centre of Hindu faith? What should stop him? Lord Ram is representative of the culture of this country,"" he told the BBC. ""The culture of the majority dominates the country, so it is 100% right that the PM do the opening. This does not mean we are discriminating on the basis of religion."" There is also controversy around moving the idols into an unfinished temple, with some Hindu religious leaders accusing the government of prioritising electoral gains over the sanctity of Hindu rituals. ""I don't want to comment on what our religious leaders say. But the sanctum sanctorum where the idol will sit is complete. More worshippers will be able to come with ease now, that's why we are opening it,"" the MP says. Back in 1992, the BJP's senior leaders expressed regret over the demolition of the mosque and said it should never have happened. How does Lallu Singh feel about it now? ""I believe what happened was right,"" he says. Most Muslims and Hindus the BBC spoke to don't think longer-term there will be more hostilities in Ayodhya. But some see Ayodhya as just the start - disputes and court cases are already ongoing over mosques in the cities of Mathura and Varanasi, referred to many by its ancient name Kashi. ""We had to wait for 450 years to get the birthplace of Lord Ram. I hope Kashi and Mathura will be ours soon too,"" says Aakash Jadhav, a 21-year-old Hindu devotee. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"The secret sauce for Taiwan's chip superstardom","By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes",2023-12-17,"When 23-year-old Shih Chin-tay boarded a plane for the United States in the summer of 1969, he was flying to a different world. He grew up in a fishing village surrounded by sugarcane fields. He had attended university in Taiwan's capital Taipei, then a city of dusty streets and grey apartment buildings where people rarely owned cars. Now he was off to Princeton University. The US had just put a man on the Moon and the Boeing 747 in the skies. Its economy was larger than those of the Soviet Union, Japan, Germany and France combined. ""When I landed, I was shocked,"" Dr Shih, now 77, says. ""I thought to myself: Taiwan is so poor, I must do something to try and help make it better off."" And he did. Dr Shih and a group of young, ambitious engineers transformed an island that exported sugar and t-shirts into an electronics powerhouse. Today's Taipei is rich and hip. High-speed trains zip passengers along the west coast of the island at 350km/h (218mph). Taipei 101 - briefly the tallest building in the world - towers over the city, an emblem of its prosperity. Much of that is down to a tiny device no larger than a fingernail. The silicon semiconductor - wafer-thin and best-known now as a chip - sits at the heart of every technology we use, from iPhones to airplanes. Taiwan now makes more than half the chips that power our lives. Its biggest manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is the ninth-most valuable business in the world. That makes Taiwan nearly irreplaceable - and vulnerable. China, fearing it could be cut off from the most advanced chips, is spending billions to steal Taiwan's crown. Or it could take the island, as it has repeatedly threatened to do. But Taiwan's path to chip superstardom will not be easy to replicate - the island has a secret sauce, honed through decades of laborious work by its engineers. Plus, the manufacturing relies on a web of economic ties that the escalating US-China rivalry is now trying to undo. When Dr Shih arrived at Princeton, ""the US was just beginning the semiconductor revolution"", he says. It had just been a decade since Robert Noyce made the ""monolithic integrated circuit"", packing electronic components onto a single wafer of silicon - an early version of the microchip which kickstarted the personal computer revolution. For the two years after Dr Shih graduated, he designed memory chips at Burroughs Corporation, second then to IBM in computer-making. At the time, Taiwan was hunting for a new national industry following an oil crisis that had pummelled its exports. Silicon seemed like a possibility - and Dr Shih thought he could help: ""I thought it was time to come home."" In the late 1970s, he joined Taiwan's best and brightest electrical engineers at a new research lab - the staid-sounding Industrial Technology Research Institute would play an outsized role in recasting the island's economy. Work began in Hsinchu, a small city south of Taipei - today it's a global electronics hub, dominated by TSMC's enormous fabrication plants. These chip factories, each the size of several football fields, are some of the cleanest places on earth. The finer manufacturing details are a well-guarded secret, and no outside cameras are allowed. The newest factory - the nearly $20bn fab 18 in southern Taiwan - will soon start producing three-nanometre chips destined for next-generation iPhones. All of this is far beyond what Dr Shih and his colleagues imagined when they opened an experimental factory in the 1970s. They were hopeful because they had technology licensed from a major US electronics maker - but to everyone's surprise, the factory outperformed its parent. It's hard to explain why and, to this day, the precise formula for Taiwan's success remains elusive. Dr Shih's recollection is more prosaic: ""Output was better than the original RCA plant, with lower costs. So, this gave the government confidence that maybe we really could do something."" The Taiwanese government put up the initial capital - first for the United Micro-electronics Corporation, and then in 1987 for what would become the world's biggest chip factory - TSMC. To run it, they recruited Morris Chang, a Chinese-American engineer and former executive at US electronics giant Texas Instruments. It was a stroke of luck or genius, or both - today the 93-year-old is known as the father of Taiwan's semiconductor industry. Back then, he quickly realised that taking on US and Japanese giants at their own game was a losing proposition. Instead TSMC would only manufacture chips for others, and not design its own. This ""foundry model"", which was unheard of in 1987, changed the landscape of the industry and paved the way for Taiwan to become the pack leader. And the timing couldn't have been better. Silicon Valley's new crop of start-ups - including Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia - did not have the funds to build fab plants of their own. And they would struggle to find manufacturers for the chips that they couldn't function without. ""They would have to go to leading semi-conductor companies and ask if they had any excess production capacity they could use,"" Dr Shih says. ""But then TSMC came along."" Now California's ""fabless"" companies could partner with Taiwan's chip makers, who had no interest in stealing their designs or competing with them. ""Rule number one at TSMC is don't compete with your customers,"" Dr Shih says. The world produces more than a trillion chips a year. A modern car has anywhere between 1,500 to 3,000 chips. The iPhone 12 reportedly had around 1,400 semiconductors. A shortfall in 2022, driven by soaring demand for electronics during the pandemic, hit sales of washing machines and BMWs alike. Taiwan's extraordinary success - the island ships more than half of those trillion-plus chips, and nearly all of the most advanced ones - has been driven by its mastery of volume. In other words, Taiwanese manufacturing is incredibly efficient. Making silicon chips is expensive and painstaking. It starts off with a large ingot of ultra-pure silicon grown from a single crystal. Each ingot may take several days to grow and could weigh up to 100kg. After a diamond cutter slices the slab into skinny wafers, a machine uses light to etch tiny circuits onto each wafer. A single wafer may contain hundreds of microprocessors, and billions of circuits. What matters eventually is the yield - the area of each wafer that is usable as a chip. In the 1970s US companies had yields as low as 10% and, at best, 50%.  By the 1980s the Japanese were averaging at 60%. TSMC has reportedly surpassed them all with a yield that hovers around 80%. Over time Taiwanese manufacturers have managed to cram more and more circuits into mind-bogglingly smaller spaces. Using the latest extreme-ultraviolet light lithography machines, TSMC can etch 100 billion circuits on to a single microprocessor, or over 100 million circuits per square millimetre. Why are Taiwanese companies so good at  this?  No-one seems to know exactly why. Dr Shih thinks it's simple: ""We had brand new facilities, with the most up-to-date equipment. We recruited the best engineers. Even the machine operators were highly skilled. And then we didn't just import technology, we absorbed the lessons from our American teachers and applied continuous improvement."" A young man who spent several years working at one of Taiwan's largest electronics companies agrees: ""I think Taiwan's companies are bad at making big breakthroughs in technology. But they are very good at taking someone else's idea and making it better. This can be done by trial and error, continuously tweaking small things."" This is important because in a semiconductor fab the machines need to be constantly calibrated. Making microchips is engineering. But it's also more than that. Some have likened it to cooking - like a gourmet feast. Give two chefs the same recipe and ingredients - the better cook will make the better dish. In other words, Taiwan has a secret sauce. But the young man, who did not want to reveal his name, or that of the company, says Taiwanese companies have another advantage. ""Compared to software engineers in the US, even at the best companies here, engineers are paid quite badly,"" he said. ""But compared to other industries in Taiwan the pay is good.  So, if you work for a big electronic company after a few years, you'll be able to get a mortgage, buy a car. You'll be able to get married. So, people suck it up."" He described a six-day week which began each day with a meeting at 07:30 and would usually last until 19:00. He would also be called in on Sundays or holidays if there was a problem at the plant. ""If people weren't willing to do the job the company would be finished. It's because people are willing to put up with hardship that these companies succeed."" In December 2022 TSMC broke ground on a $40bn plant in the US state of Arizona. It was hailed by President Joe Biden as a sign that high-tech manufacturing was returning to American soil. Since then the headlines have been somewhat less cheery. They Wouldn't Listen To Us: Inside Arizona's Troubled Chip Plant, read one. Another said, TSMC Struggles To Recruit Workers While Facing Pushback From Unions. Chip production was supposed to start next year. Now it's been put back to 2025. Former TSMC chairman Dr Chang was deeply sceptical from the start. Last year he described expanding chip production in the US as an ""expensive, wasteful exercise in futility"" because manufacturing chips in the US  would be 50% more expensive than in Taiwan. But Taiwan's chip-making prowess has put it at the centre of the tech war between the US and China. Washington wants to prevent Taiwan supplying China with the cutting-edge chips it fears Beijing will use to accelerate its weapons programs and advance its artificial intelligence. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which strangled Europe's gas supply, US politicians are jittery about Taiwan. They fear that the huge concentration of high-end chip production on the island makes the US economy hostage to a Chinese invasion. But Taiwanese companies see little economic advantage in moving production off the island. They are doing so reluctantly under political pressure. People in Taiwan resent the idea that they should be blamed for their success - and that Taiwan should voluntarily weaken what many regard as its ""silicon shield"", while the rest of the world vacillates over whether the island and its democratic society is worth protecting from Chinese aggression. Dr Shih says those who are seeking to forcibly restructure global chip production misunderstand its success. ""If you look at the history of semiconductors, no one country dominates this industry,"" he  says. ""Taiwan may dominate the manufacturing sector. But there is a very long supply chain and innovation from every part of it contributes to the growth of the industry. "" Much of the world's raw silicon comes from China, although most of it goes to the solar industry. Germany and Japan lead the charge in chemicals that are necessary to process the wafers. Carl Zeiss, a German optoelectronics company better known for making eyewear and camera lenses, produces optical devices that go into the lithography machines made by a leading Dutch company, ASML. The laborious manufacturing works to designs that originate in American companies or the UK-based Arm. Dr Shih is doubtful Beijing can recreate this supply chain - from materials to design to high-end production - inside China. ""If they want to create a different model then I wish them luck,"" he says with a shrug. ""Because if you really want innovation, you need everyone to work together from all around the world. It's not one company or one country."" He is just as doubtful about cutting China out as the US has been doing. ""I think that's probably a major mistake,"" he says. ""When I look back, I feel lucky to have witnessed the extraordinary growth of Taiwan's economy and this long period of peace. Now I see conflict in other parts of the world, and I worry it may come to Asia. ""I hope people appreciate the precious effort that we made and won't destroy it."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Haikun: Taiwan unveils new submarine to fend off China","By Tessa Wong",2023-09-28,"Taiwan has unveiled its first domestically-made submarine as it bolsters its defences against a possible Chinese attack. President Tsai Ing-wen presided over the launch ceremony in the port city of Kaohsiung on Thursday. US officials have warned that China could be militarily capable of mounting an invasion within the next few years. Taiwan is a self-governing island which China regards as a renegade province and has vowed to reclaim one day. Most observers believe China will not attack the island imminently, and Beijing has said it seeks peaceful ""reunification"" with Taiwan. But at the same time it has warned against Taiwan formally declaring independence and any foreign support. It has increasingly sought to put pressure on the island with its military drills in the Taiwan Strait, including several conducted this month. ""History will forever remember this day,"" said Ms Tsai as she stood in front of the towering submarine draped in the emblem of Taiwan's flag. She added that the idea of a domestically-made submarine had previously been considered ""an impossible task… but we did it"". Building their own submarines has long been a key priority for Taiwan's leaders, but the programme accelerated under Ms Tsai who has revved up military spending to nearly double its budget during her tenure. The $1.54bn (£1.27bn) diesel-electric powered submarine will undergo several tests and will be delivered to the navy by the end of 2024, according to military officials. It has been named the Haikun after a mythical massive fish that can also fly, which appears in classic Chinese literature. Another one is currently in production. Taiwan aims to eventually operate a fleet of 10 submarines - including two older Dutch-made boats - and equip them with missiles. The head of the domestic submarine programme Admiral Huang Shu-kuang told reporters last week that the goal was to fend off any attempt from China to encircle Taiwan for an invasion or impose a naval blockade. It would also buy time until US and Japan forces arrive to aid Taiwan's defence, he added. When asked by reporters about the submarine on Thursday, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said it was ""idiotic nonsense"" to try to stop their military's actions in the Pacific. ""No amount of weapons [Taiwan's ruling] Democratic Progressive Party buys or makes can stop reunification with the motherland,"" he added. In a piece published earlier this week, state media outlet Global Times said Taiwan was ""daydreaming"" and the plan was ""just an illusion"". It also claimed China's military ""has already constructed a multidimensional anti-submarine network all around the island"". Observers agree that the new submarines could help boost Taiwan's defence. Taiwan's 10-submarine fleet would pale in comparison to China's, said to currently comprise more than 60 boats including nuclear-powered attack submarines, with more on the way. But the island has long pursued an asymmetric warfare strategy where it aims to build a more agile defence force to face down a larger and well-resourced enemy. The submarines could ""aid Taiwan's relatively small navy in taking initiative against China's mighty navy"" by conducting ""guerrilla style warfare with their stealth, lethality and surprise capabilities"", noted William Chung, a military researcher with the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan. In particular, he said, they could help guard the various straits and channels that link the so-called ""first island chain"", a network of islands including Taiwan, Philippines and Japan seen as a possible battlefront for any conflict with China. Anti-submarine warfare remains the Chinese navy's ""weakest part, and this is the chance for Taiwan to exploit it"", he added. But the ""centre of gravity"" for any China-Taiwan naval conflict would not likely be in the deep waters off the island's east coast, where submarines would be most effective in, pointed out Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore and former US Department of Defense official. Instead, the main theatre of war would be in the shallower waters of the west coast facing mainland China. ""The submarine is not optimised for a counter invasion role... having this increased capability to complicate China's military operations would have an effect, but it's not a decisive one,"" he said. Their effectiveness would largely depend on how Taiwan chooses to deploy them. Beyond playing a deterrent role they could also be used to ambush Chinese ships; carry out mine-laying operations in Chinese ports; disrupt maritime oil supplies; and destroy key facilities on the Chinese coastline, according to Chieh Chung, a defence researcher with Taiwanese think tank National Policy Foundation. What is more significant, however, is that Taiwan managed to design and build its own submarine in the first place. The Haikun uses a combat system by US defence company Lockheed Martin and will carry US-made torpedoes. While this may be no surprise given that the US is Taiwan's chief ally, at least six other countries including the UK came to Taiwan's aid in supplying components, technology and talent, according to a Reuters report. Adm Huang told Nikkei Asia he had personally approached military contacts in the US, Japan, South Korea and India for help but did not specify which country eventually agreed. The fact that several countries and companies were ""not afraid to supply parts to a marquee defence programme in Taiwan... indicates a significant geopolitical shift"", noted Mr Thompson. It is an indicator of the ""doubt and dissatisfaction"" with Beijing felt by some members of the international community, and ""should cause China to feel disquiet"", added Mr Chieh. The launch comes a day after Beijing confirmed it had been conducting military drills this month to ""resolutely combat the arrogance of Taiwan independence separatist forces"". In recent weeks it had once again ramped up its warship presence in the Taiwan Strait and military jet incursions into airspace around the island. US military and intelligence officials have given varying timelines for a possible Chinese invasion. One date put forth recently is 2027 - Chinese President Xi Jinping is believed to have told his military to be operationally capable of mounting an invasion by that year. But CIA director William Burns also said it did not necessarily mean Mr Xi would decide to invade then as he is thought to have doubts over whether China would succeed. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Warning public debt could soar as population ages","By Daniel Thomas & Tom Espiner",2023-07-13,"The UK's public debt could soar as the population ages and tax receipts fall, the government's independent forecaster has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said debt could rise to more than 300% of the size of the economy by 2070, up from around 100% currently. Climate change and geopolitical tensions also posed ""significant"" risks to government finances, it added. But it called current government plans to reduce debt ""relatively modest"". It comes as separate figures show the UK economy has barely grown since 2019 before the pandemic. Commenting on the OBR report, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government would take ""difficult but responsible"" decisions on the public finances. Public debt is the stockpile of money borrowed by the government over the years to fund its spending. Mr Hunt has set a target of getting underlying debt to fall in five years' time. In a report, the OBR said the 2020s were turning out to be a ""very risky era for the public finances"". It said the pandemic, cost-of-living crisis and recent interest rate rises had hit the economy and driven up government borrowing costs. As a result, it said: From this ""vulnerable position"", it said, the government now faced growing costs from an ageing society. This will drive up pension spending in the short term, and by 2070 shrink the ratio of working age people to retired people. ""This puts downward pressure on tax receipts, upward pressure on primary spending, and leaves a growing gap between the two,"" the OBR said. The forecasting body said that the government's debt interest costs were also set to surge. And it said borrowing would rise as government spending on defence increased to meet ""growing security threats in Europe and Asia"". Decarbonising the economy to reach net zero by 2050 would also cost the government billions in extra spending, it said. All of these factors could lead to the size of the UK's debt compared to the size of the economy - as measured by the debt-to-GDP ratio - tripling over the next 50 years, the OBR said. It added that unforeseen shocks or unfunded policies could drive it even higher. The OBR added that the government's current plan for stabilising and then reducing debt - as a share of GDP by 2027-28 - was ""relatively modest by historical and international standards"". Commenting, Mr Hunt said the government would take ""difficult but responsible decisions on the public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary"". But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the OBR's report showed ""just how far we are falling behind our peers"". ""There are serious decisions to be made by this Tory government to restore some security in our economy, to get a grip on inflation, and to stop people's bills rising."" The OBR's report also warned gas prices are expected to remain high until at least 2025. Soaring oil and gas prices have contributed to the rapid pace of general price rises, putting struggling households under pressure. After a massive 13-fold price jump in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gas prices have fallen back - but are still more than twice as expensive as before. The OBR said the hike in gas prices had made renewable energy cheaper than gas over its life-time for the first time. However, despite this, it said there was ""little sign of a step-change in renewable energy investment in the UK"". Planned UK government investments in green technologies will not get the country to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the OBR said. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Just Stop Oil: What is it and what are its goals?",NA,2024-06-19,"Just Stop Oil activists have sprayed orange powder paint on parts of Stonehenge. The environmental campaign group has carried out many high-profile protests, including blocking roads, stopping play at sports matches and halting theatre productions. It wants action on climate change, but its tactics are controversial. Just Stop Oil (JSO) wants the UK to stop approving new fossil fuel projects, which are a major cause of climate change. However, in July 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that 100 new North Sea licences had been granted. And in November, he said further licences would be awarded annually. The group says it uses ""non-violent civil resistance"" and will stop protesting when the government announces an end to fossil-fuel production. Just Stop Oil is linked to other environmental groups, including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain. The group came to prominence when its activists shut down major roads such as the M25 and Dartford crossing in November 2022. Since then, JSO has also targeted several major sporting events, including the Wimbledon tennis championships, the second Ashes Test at Lord's cricket ground and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield. Cultural events, including a performance of the musical Les Miserables in London and a BBC Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall, have also been disrupted. In the National Gallery, supporters threw tomato soup over Vincent Van Gogh's painting Sunflowers and smashed the protective glass screen on Diego Velazquez's Rokeby Venus. JSO protesters also damaged the case around the Magna Carta, at the British Library. In June 2024, two activists were arrested on suspicion of damaging Stonehenge, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) world heritage site. Just Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and would ""wash away with rain"". English Heritage chief executive, Dr Nick Merriman, said there appeared to be ""no visible damage"" after experts cleaned the site. But Mr Sunak said it was a ""disgraceful act of vandalism"", while Labour leader Keir Starmer called it ""outrageous"" and JSO ""pathetic"". The maximum penalty for the wilful obstruction of a highway in England and Wales is 51 weeks in prison. Offenders can also be fined. Several transport bodies, including National Highways and Transport for London, have sought High Court injunctions to prevent protesters disrupting major roads. Anyone breaching an injunction can be held in contempt of court, and could face imprisonment, an unlimited fine and seizure of assets. In 2023, Parliament passed new anti-protest legislation under the Public Order Act. This gives powers to prosecute someone who interferes with the operation or use of key national infrastructure in England and Wales - including roads, railways, and air transport. Previously, the police could generally only restrict a protest if they could show it may result in ""serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"". The new legislation lowers the threshold for ""serious disruption"", allowing police to respond to action which prevents or delays day-to-day activities such as completing a journey. It also made ""locking-on"" - whereby protesters attach themselves to buildings, objects or other people - a criminal offence. Many Just Stop Oil activists have used this tactic. In May 2024, BBC News reported a review into tackling political violence, by Lord Walney, would suggest ""extreme protest groups"" such as JSO could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. The plan could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate. At the time, the Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations - but the general election was called a few weeks later and it is now unclear when or if Lord Walney's report will be published. In response, JSO said the government were the ""dangerous radicals that are endangering all of us"", through its climate policies. In December 2023, the Met Police said it had spent £20m policing JSO protests and the time spent on the group equated to roughly 300 officers being removed front-line policing each day. It said the group ""refused to engage"" with police when planning protests. ""Our desire is that Just Stop Oil come forward and speak with us, so we can actually work with them,"" Cdr Kyle Gordon said. ""We absolutely understand and support the fundamental right to protest within a democratic society - but what we've got to do is balance that right with the rights of everybody else who is using this city."" In the past Just Stop Oil has quoted a 2021 Supreme Court ruling which found there should be a ""certain degree of tolerance to disruption to ordinary life, including the disruption of traffic"", as a result of non-violent protest. According to its website, most of its money comes from the Climate Emergency Fund - a US network which has supported climate activism since 2019. That is part-funded by US philanthropist Aileen Getty, the granddaughter of petrol tycoon J Paul Getty. Just Stop Oil says it also receives donations from the public and other organisations concerned about climate change. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"UN criticises 'severe' Just Stop Oil sentences","By Justin Rowlatt",2023-11-21,"Long jail sentences handed to two Just Stop Oil climate campaigners could stifle protest, the United Nations has warned the UK government. The protesters caused traffic gridlock after scaling the Dartford Crossing Bridge for almost 40 hours in October last year. Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed for three years and Marcus Decker, 34, for two years for causing a public nuisance. In response to the UN, the government said that the right to protest is a fundamental part of the UK’s democracy but that the ""law-abiding majority"" must be able to go about their daily lives. At an appeal hearing last month Lady Chief Justice, Lady Carr defended the sentences, saying they met a ""legitimate"" aim of deterring others from such offending. The activists were refused permission to challenge them in the Supreme Court. The warning comes in a letter shown to BBC News, sent to the government by the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, Ian Fry, on 15 August this year. The sentences are ""significantly more severe than previous sentences imposed for this type of offending in the past,"" Mr Fry notes. He says he is worried about “the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association”. The letter goes on to say the new Public Order Act which came into force in July ""appears to be a direct attack on the right to the freedom of peaceful assembly"". The new legislation includes measures aimed at curbing disruptive protests. The letter sent in mid-August requested a reply within 60 days but has not received one, which the UN special rapporteur described as ""troubling"".

"PM defends 'severe' Just Stop Oil sentences","By Justin Rowlatt",2023-11-21,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has defended sentences handed to two Just Stop Oil climate campaigners following criticism from the United Nations. Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed for three years and Marcus Decker, 34, for two years for causing a public nuisance after scaling the Dartford Crossing Bridge. The UN had warned the government in a letter that the ""severe"" sentences could stifle protest. Mr Sunak said in response in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that those who break the law should feel the full force of it. ""It's entirely right that selfish protestors intent on causing misery to the hard-working majority face tough sentences,"" he said. ""It's what the public expects and it's what we've delivered."" At an appeal hearing last month Lady Chief Justice, Lady Carr defended the sentences, saying they met a ""legitimate"" aim of deterring others from such offending. The activists were refused permission to challenge them in the Supreme Court. The warning came in a letter shown to BBC News, sent to the government by the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, Ian Fry, on 15 August this year. The sentences are ""significantly more severe than previous sentences imposed for this type of offending in the past,"" Mr Fry notes. He says he is worried about “the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association”. The letter goes on to say the new Public Order Act which came into force in July ""appears to be a direct attack on the right to the freedom of peaceful assembly"". The new legislation includes measures aimed at curbing disruptive protests. The letter sent in mid-August requested a reply within 60 days but has not received one, which the UN special rapporteur described as ""troubling"". ""Most countries take these letters seriously and respond,"" Mr Fry told BBC News. He suggested that the lack of a formal reply reflected ""a general disregard for human rights concerns by the current government"". The Home Office said it had ""responded"" to the special rapporteur’s letter.

"Student fined over Exeter graduation protest",NA,2023-12-01,"A University of Exeter student who was arrested at his own graduation ceremony after letting off a fire extinguisher full of orange paint has been fined. Edward Whittingham, 26, from Norwich, used the extinguisher outside the university's Great Hall in July as part of a Just Stop Oil protest. He denied two charges of causing criminal damage to the concrete piazza outside the hall and damaging the clothing of a guard. District Judge Stuart Smith found him guilty of damaging the guard's clothes and boots but not guilty of ""minor and trivial"" damage to the paving. His trial heard the Exeter incident came two months after he threw orange powder on a snooker table during televised championships at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Prosecutors at Exeter Magistrates' Court alleged Whittingham's actions were premeditated, not peaceful and a potential risk to people. The court heard he made a video before the protest saying: ""What is the point of education if you are dead?"" The incident lasted about 10 to 15 seconds in a busy area where graduates were having their photographs taken. Whittingham told the court many millions faced death if action was not taken on climate change, and he demanded the government end new oil and gas projects. The judge said the politics and philosophy student held ""genuine beliefs"" on climate change. He added: ""This was not a violent protest."" Whittingham was fined £882, including costs and compensation. Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Europe heatwaves: Wildfires rage in Greece as temperatures soar","By Thomas Mackintosh",2023-07-19,"Large swathes of southern Europe continue to swelter in record heat as wildfires rage across the continent. Temperatures hit a high of 46.3C in Sicily on Tuesday, and crews battled fires in Greece and the Swiss Alps. Most of Italy's major cities are on red alert, meaning the extreme heat carries a health risk to everybody not just vulnerable groups. Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves longer, more intense and more frequent. Across the world, millions of people are being impacted by extreme weather; from soaring temperatures in the US and China, to heavy rainfall in East Asia. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says heatwaves will become more severe in the years ahead, and that extreme weather patterns highlight the need for more climate action. ""These events will continue to grow in intensity and the world needs to prepare for more intense heatwaves,"" said John Nairn, senior extreme heat advisor at the UN agency. Since Monday, Greece has seen multiple wildfires break out across the country - including one which led to the evacuation of 1,200 children from a summer camp. The most severe fire in Greece currently is in the Dervenochoria region north of Athens, where billowing smoke can be seen on satellite images. Other fires continue to rage in towns of Loutraki - a coastal town near the city of Corinth - and in Kouvaras, south of the capital. ""Our main concern is protecting human life,"" fire service spokesman Yannis Artopios said. Elsewhere in Europe, crews in Switzerland are battling a wildfire close to the village of Bitsch in canton Valais which authorities said started on Monday afternoon and spread ""explosively"" overnight. Another wildfire on the Spanish island of La Palma, which started on Saturday, has destroyed 20 homes. But, cooler overnight temperatures and higher air humidity levels helped firefighters gain the upper hand in their battle against the blaze and bring it under control. Red alerts, warning people of a very high health risk due to the intense heat, remain in place for most of Italy, Spain, Greece and parts of the Balkans. Official maximum temperatures for Tuesday have not yet been confirmed, but provision results showed a high of 45.3C in Figueres in north-west Spain, 44.5C in Bauladu on the island of Sardinia, and 46.3C in Licata on Sicily. The highest temperature ever recorded in Europe was set in August 2021 when the mercury hit 48.8C (119.8F) in the Palermo region of Sicily. Extreme temperatures have also gripped other parts of the globe including the US and China. More than 80 million people in western and southern US states are under advisories for a ""widespread and oppressive"" heatwave. Temperatures at California's Death Valley hit a near-record 52C (125.6F) Sunday, while on Monday Arizona's state capital Phoenix tied its record of 18 consecutive days above 43C (109.4F). China provisionally broke its record for all-time highest temperature on Sunday when it recorded 52.2C (126F) in its western Xinjiang region, according to the UK Met Office. Also in Asia, on China's eastern coast torrential rain brought on by Typhoon Talim has displaced thousands. Talim is heading for Vietnam where 30,000 people in the storm's path have moved to safer ground. It comes as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol vowed to ""completely overhaul"" the country's approach to extreme weather after dozens were killed in widespread flooding and landslides at the weekend. Leading UK scientist Dr Frederieke Otto, from Imperial College London, told the BBC that ""what we are seeing at the moment is exactly what we expect in a world where we are still burning fossil fuels"". Humans are ""100% behind"" the upward trend in global temperatures, she explains. The International Energy Agency has said there can be no new oil, gas or coal projects if governments are serious about tackling climate change. Scientists say Europe in particular is warming faster than many climate models predicted. ""There is a feeling that it's going out of control,"" University of Reading Prof Hannah Cloke explains. ""We have a lot of work to do to pin down exactly what's happening. These heatwaves are frightening...We know this will be really deadly."" She said more than 61,000 people were estimated to have died from heat in Europe last year, and this year would be similar. How have you been affected by the extreme heat?

"Just Stop Oil protesters interrupt the Proms",NA,2023-07-15,"Two protesters from environmental campaign group Just Stop Oil have interrupted the First Night of the Proms at London's Royal Albert Hall. The duo mounted the stage and briefly unfurled an orange banner on Friday. They were met with boos and jeers from some members of the audience at the BBC's classical music festival, before being led away by security staff. Just Stop Oil has targeted a number of events this year, including the Ashes, Wimbledon and the Chelsea Flower Show. In a tweet, Just Stop Oil said two of its supporters ran onto the stage to demand ""the UK government immediately halt all new oil and gas consents and licences"". It added ""they attempted to address the audience before being forcibly removed"". The group said the action, which happened shortly after the interval, targeted the event because of the BBC's ""underwhelming coverage of the climate emergency"". The group claimed the protesters had used confetti cannons and air horns, but eyewitnesses denied this and video footage shows the protest was stopped quickly. A BBC spokesman said: ""There was no disruption to the concert or the broadcast during the few seconds the protesters were on stage."" The Proms opening night featured a new translation of Jean Sibelius's Snöfrid, narrated by actress Lesley Manville, and a new work by Ukrainian composer Bohdana Frolyak, called Let The Light In. In response to the incident, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer wrote on social media: ""My message is this: Leave people to enjoy the events they love, and stop damaging your own cause."" During the Proms programme and before the protest, BBC Radio 3 broadcaster Georgia Mann remarked on how close members of the audience were to the performers at the Royal Albert Hall. ""Somehow it surprises me every summer when we sit here from this vantage point just how close the Prommers are to the artists - I've said before - touching distance,"" she said. Six thousand people were gathered in the venue for the sell-out event. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Just Stop Oil: Five charged after protesters disrupt Les Miserables","By Sam Hancock",2023-10-05,"Five Just Stop Oil protesters have been charged with aggravated trespass after a performance of Les Miserables in London's West End was halted. A video shared by the activist group showed demonstrators getting up on to the Sondheim Theatre's stage and asking the audience to ""join the rebellion"". Audience members can be heard booing and telling the activists to ""get off"". The show on Wednesday night did not resume - organisers instead offered refunds or tickets for another night. Having arrested five people, aged between 18 and 28, the Metropolitan Police later confirmed that all had been charged. The force also released their names: Catherine Francoise, from Buckinghamshire, was in the audience with a group of more than 30 people who she organises theatre trips for. She said she had been sitting ""in the centre of the front row"" and that people who appeared to be protesters were seated at either end of the second row. Ms Francoise said: ""I could see out the corner of my eye something happening on the left, I noticed first, and I knew it wasn't part of the production. ""The cast were still going, the orchestra was still playing, and after about 15 seconds, somebody came on stage and moved the cast off. ""Meanwhile, security were on it trying to get the girls off that were on the left-hand side."" She said it appeared the protesters had locked themselves to parts of the set. She said that the cast members were removed from the stage, shortly followed by the orchestra, with the audience being asked to leave about 15 minutes later. ""The audience were definitely making far, far more noise than the protesters,"" she said. What is Just Stop Oil and what does it want? The stage invasion happened during the show's famous protest song of Do You Hear the People Sing? It is often described as being about a revolutionary call to action and has been used all over the world by protest movements, including in the 2019 Hong Kong demonstrations. Posting on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday, Just Stop Oil said:"" Valjean steals bread to feed a starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal?"" Jean Valjean is the protagonist in Les Miserables. The post continued: ""The fossil fuel show can't go on."" William Village, chief executive of Delfont Mackintosh Theatres - which owns the Sondheim - said ""safety protocols"" had to be followed and ""the audience were asked to leave the auditorium and the Met Police attended"". ""Regrettably, there was insufficient time to enable us to complete the rest of the performance,"" he said in a statement. ""Whilst we recognise the importance of free expression, we must also respect our audience's right to enjoy the event for which they have paid."" On its website, Just Stop Oil says its ultimate aim is to ""demand that the UK government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects"". Were you at last night's show?

"F1 British Grand Prix: Facial recognition at Silverstone being used","By Tom Percival & Pete Cooper",2023-07-06,"Facial recognition technology will be used for the first time at the Formula 1 British Grand Prix to try to stop criminal activity. Northamptonshire Police said it would be used to spot those who pose a ""risk of danger to the wider public"". That could include wanted criminals, those involved in serious crime, or ""unlawful protest"", the force said. Det Supt Richard Tompkins said officers had ""thought long and hard"" about the use of the technology. More than 450,000 people are expected at Silverstone this weekend. Mr Tompkins said: ""This is the first time that we will have used it [facial recognition] in Northamptonshire as a police force, and also the first time we've used it here at the British Grand Prix. ""There is a risk of terrorism, of serious crime and of course unlawful protest, which in itself is illegal. ""We've got signage advising people that we are doing it... but we feel that it is a proportionate response and I'm quite content it's appropriate."" A live facial recognition camera works by comparing faces with a ""watch list"" generated by police. The watch list could be made up of people who are wanted for crimes or pose a risk of harm to themselves and others, the Northamptonshire force said. Any images that trigger alerts are deleted immediately after use or within 24 hours, while those that do not trigger alerts are deleted immediately. The technology was used at the Beyoncé concert in Cardiff in May and during the Coronation. But civil liberties organisation Liberty said the technology should not be used by police forces. On race day last year protesters got on to the Wellington Straight - the fastest point of the Silverstone track. Four men and two women were  in February, with three of the six given suspended prison terms while three others were given 12-month community orders. Mr Tompkins, who was at the circuit in 2022, said: ""I think we were fortunate that we didn't get some deaths either from [the protesters], from members of the public or marshals, who would have become embroiled in that."" Northamptonshire Police said it would also have plain-clothed detectives and armed officers patrolling the circuit, among other measures to prevent disruption to the race. Climate change protesters have recently got on the pitch during an Ashes Test between England and Australia at Lord's and interrupted play twice at Wimbledon. Followers of Just Stop Oil, which calls for the government to halt all new oil, gas and coal projects, also disrupted the rugby union Premiership final and the World Snooker Championship. Mr Tompkins said it would be ""naïve"" to not believe protestors would attempt action at this year's race. He warned the force would ""be taking action and that will ultimately mean we will be looking at arrested individuals and putting them before the courts"".

"Ethiopia: UK warns of food crisis triggered by war and drought","By James Landale",2024-02-05,"In Ayder hospital in Mekelle, the capital of Ethiopia's Tigray region, the corridors are filled with the hubbub of any busy medical facility. But in the paediatric wing, there is a stillness to the wards. For here lie children numbly bearing witness to the latest food crisis to ravage northern Ethiopia. Mostly babies, they are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Their mothers sit silently at their beds, staring into the middle distance, clutching their infants to their breast, hoping what milk they have can deliver the salvation for which they yearn. For they and Ethiopia are suffering once again from a devastating legacy of conflict and drought, twin evils that in recent years have destroyed farms and crops and forced millions from their homes. The government says 16 million people across the country are facing food shortages, with almost half of those suffering emergency or severe levels of food insecurity. That means many are not just hungry, they are starving. This is why Tsega Tsigabu, 23, and her four-month-old son, Kidisty, are languishing in Ayder hospital. Her family were farmers. But their crops failed and they moved to Mekelle to try to survive. Like so many others, they ended up in a camp for people forced from their homes. Mrs Tsega's husband was in the army but he injured his hand and cannot work. She took her baby for a vaccination and the nurses saw instantly it was malnourished. ""Even when I was pregnant, I was not eating a balanced diet,"" Mrs Tsega tells us. ""I was not producing enough breast milk, that's why the baby has developed malnutrition. I just didn't have enough to eat at home."" Doctors at the hospital tell us the numbers of severely malnourished children being admitted have doubled since 2020 when the war between Tigrayan forces and Ethiopian and Eritrean armies began. A ceasefire was agreed in 2022 but the impact of the conflict still lingers with at least one million people still unable to return home remaining in the region. We travelled with the British Africa minister, Andrew Mitchell, to Agulae, an hours' drive north into the hills, where a clinic was assessing children from outlying villages. He watched as anxious mothers lined up to have the circumference of their children's arms measured; the less flesh on the bone, the more likely the malnutrition. The nurses showed him their charts and they all told a similar story of the numbers getting worse. ""There is clearly a risk of famine if we don't now take action,"" Mr Mitchell told the BBC. ""There are serious indicators of the danger of famine. If you ask me, 'Is there a famine taking place now in Ethiopia?' I say no, and we have the power to stop it. But if we don't take the necessary action now, then there is every danger that a famine will engulf this war-torn country which has suffered so much already."" He promised Britain would commit a further £100m ($125m) to help up to three million mothers and babies in Ethiopia get access to health care; a new fund to provide medicines and vaccines designed to end preventable deaths. But is famine in Ethiopia really likely? International aid agencies are cautious about using what some call ""the F- word"". It has a precise technical definition - 20% of households facing extreme food shortages, 30% of children under five with acute malnutrition, and two people out of every 10,000 dying every day. Few suggest those criteria have been formally met in Ethiopia. But for Getachew Reda, president of the Tigray interim regional administration, those definitions are otiose. He told the BBC there was an ""unfolding famine"" in Tigray. The numbers of those ""staring death in the eye"" were rising all the time, he told us, criticising the international community for its ""lacklustre"" response. ""One thing I know is that thousands of people who would otherwise have been able to feed themselves are not in a position to feed themselves and are succumbing to death because of starvation,"" Mr Getachew said. ""Whether you call it famine or a risk of famine or a potential famine, for me it's purely academic… What transpired in 1985, for example, would pale into comparison, if we fail to address the kind of unfolding famine that's staring us in the eye."" What he was referring to were the devastating crises of the mid-1980s when many hundreds of thousands died in a famine in Tigray and elsewhere. The BBC's powerful reporting of the humanitarian disaster prompted a wave of publicity and campaigning, including the Live Aid concert led by the musician Bob Geldof. These comparisons infuriate the federal government in Addis Ababa which denies there is famine. Shiferaw Teklemariam, commissioner of the Ethiopian disaster risk management commission, said Ethiopia was a victim of climate change. He warned regional governments against politicising the issue and urged them and the international community to do more. ""There is a drought, no famine,"" Mr Shiferaw told the BBC. ""The government is responding very seriously, but at the same time we call on all stakeholders to do their share."" There are politics here. Past famines in Ethiopia have sometimes been linked to the downfall of governments. Analysts say the word makes the current administration - led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed - nervous. The government is working with the UN to tackle the food crisis but the economy here is weak and budgets are being cut. The truth is that no-one really knows how bad this crisis is because hard data is difficult to obtain. Media access is limited. Many areas in the north are impossible for humanitarian agencies to visit because of continuing fighting, especially in Amhara. There, and in neighbouring Afar region, there are fears the food crisis could be even worse than in Tigray. Successive anecdotal evidence - reports from villages and towns across northern Ethiopia - suggest the situation is deteriorating. What most sides agree is the international community should be doing more. Last year USAID, America's development agency, and the United Nation's World Food Programme suspended humanitarian support for five months after it emerged that huge amounts were being stolen, much of it to feed various armed forces. This has aggravated the situation. The world is also distracted by conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and less attention and funding is being targeted at Ethiopia. The head of the UN here, Ramiz Alakbarov, said this was a forgotten crisis. ""The world is not paying attention,"" he said. ""We grieve for all the troubles and difficulties elsewhere, yet people in this part of the world cannot be forgotten. We need to get organised and donors need to step up contributions."" At a food distribution centre in Mekelle, we saw the World Food Programme doing what it could, handing out scoops of wheat and lentils along with cups of oil. The hungry queue up bearing QR codes which identify them, their households and their needs. But the food they get is a bare minimum and budgets are running thin. Claire Nevill, who speaks for the WFP in Ethiopia, said what was needed was not just food assistance but help to get people back to their farms so they can feed themselves. The problem is that parts of the country are still occupied by militias and Eritrean forces. ""In Ethiopia you have several overlapping crises at a time,"" she said. ""We have drought, people recovering from a two-year conflict, rising inflation, an upsurge in cases of disease and all of this together just pushes people further into hunger and malnutrition. So if we don't get food assistance to people right now, the situation will worsen."" Back in Ayder hospital we met Tsige Degef, 28, whose 15-month old daughter, Bereket, was malnourished. And her story was typical. Ms Tsige's extended family were forced to sell their oxen during the war to pay for expensive cereals. When peace came, the crops failed and there was nothing to fall back on. Ms Tsige was already struggling when Bereket fell ill. ""Her feet and legs were swollen,"" she said. ""I was so worried. She was vomiting every day. The fear of a mother with a sick child is the fear of death."" But Bereket is getting better and Ms Tsige is hopeful of leaving hospital. ""I wish she will heal soon,"" she said. ""I want to open a tea shop and sell things so I can better protect my child. I promise to do the best I can so that she doesn't suffer in the future.""
