"1","Just Stop Oil activists get conditional bail","By Shivani Chaudhari",2024-07-04,"Police investigating an incident in which private jets were sprayed with orange paint by Just Stop Oil activists have released two women on bail. Jennifer Kowalski, 28, from Dumbarton, and Cole Macdonald, 22, from Brighton, were arrested after angle grinders were used to break through fencing at Stansted Airport at about 05:00 BST on 5 June. Both women deny charges of criminal damage, aggravated trespass and interfering with national infrastructure. They were granted conditional bail and released from HMP Peterborough on Wednesday. Just Stop Oil had said the private jet of popstar Taylor Swift was targeted at the Essex airport, but police said it was not there at the time. Two private aircraft on a taxiway were sprayed with fire extinguishers loaded with orange paint during the incident, police said. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court had previously heard 75 flights were disrupted during a 38-minute delay, affecting thousands of passengers. The pair were originally denied bail and were due to appear for another hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court on 22 July.","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crge8vjg8y3o",1
"2","Just Stop Oil pair sentenced for snooker protest","By Oli Constable",2024-07-10,"A Just Stop Oil protester who jumped onto a snooker table and covered it in orange powder during the World Snooker Championship has been given an 18-month community order. Edred Whittingham, 26, disrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on 17 April 2023, with an international TV audience witnessing the protest. On Wednesday at Sheffield Magistrates' Court, he was also told to pay £899 in compensation for damaging the table and asked to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Whittingham, of Exeter, denied a criminal damage charge but was found guilty after a one-day trial in May. Co-defendant Margaret Reid, 53, from Kendal, in Cumbria, was given a two-year community order and told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work after being found guilty of attempting to cause criminal damage on another table. Completion of the first-round match was delayed until the following day as a result of the protest, with Whittingham throwing dyed corn starch powder. Reid's attempts to disrupt the match on the other table, on which Mark Allen and Fan Zhengyi were playing, were foiled when she was stopped by referee Olivier Marteel. District Judge Daniel Curtis told the pair prison was ""almost inevitable"" if they continued their criminal activities. Spectators were ""robbed"" of entertainment when the matches were stopped, World Snooker Tour chief executive officer Simon Brownell said in a victim impact statement read to court. ""They bought a ticket to our event and gave their best effort to destroy it, without a care in the world for the thousands of people who saved their money to attend,"" he said. Security costs had increased by ""hundreds of thousands of pounds"" following the incident, he added. In mitigation for Whittingham, the court heard the type of substance was selected ""not to cause maximum damage but simply to have a visual effect as part of the protest"". Representing herself in court, Reid said: ""I'm a pretty boring middle-aged person that, like a lot of people, tries to do their best - it would have been much easier to stay at home and pretend my little community was going to be fine."" Sentencing the pair to community orders, Judge Curtis said some people ""will be highly critical"" of not sending them to prison, adding he had to apply the sentencing guidelines. Outside court, Whittingham told the BBC he would continue protesting, adding: ""We're facing a climate crisis. ""Prison time, community service, it's not going to deter us."" Whittingham was also told to carry out a 25-day rehabilitation order along with paying £390 in trial costs. Reid was given a 10-day rehabilitation order, told to pay £390 trial costs and handed a £114 victim surcharge.","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1we0pzw8pwo",1
"3","Two cleared over Just Stop Oil rugby final protest",NA,2024-06-25,"Two Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters who invaded the pitch at Twickenham during a rugby final have been cleared of criminal damage. Samuel Johnson, 41, a construction worker from Essex, and Patrick Hart, 38, a GP from Bristol, threw orange powder during the Gallagher Premiership final between Saracens and Sale in May 2023. They were acquitted by a jury at Kingston Crown Court on Tuesday. The pair still face a charge of aggravated trespass, which has been sent back to Wimbledon Magistrates' Court to be dealt with at a later date. JSO said prosecutors struggled to prove that the two men had intended to cause criminal damage, because they would not have realised how difficult it would be to clean the powder paint from the Twickenham pitch. Similar paint was thrown by activists during the Ashes at Lord's and was easily cleaned up with a leaf blower, but the hybrid pitch at Twickenham is a combination of natural and plastic grass and much more difficult to clean. Mr Johnson said: ""I took part in this action because our politicians continue to issue licences, knowing full well it will result in the deaths of millions of people. “Thousands have died due to extreme heat brought on by climate change while we were on trial. ""This is happening now.” Dr Hart said: “I told the jury that I am taking the most effective action I can, on the best available evidence, to protect the health of my patients. ""To put it simply: I am doing my duty as a doctor.” The Crown Prosecution Service said it respected the jury's decision.","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck55grde7l5o",1
"4","Stonehenge covered in powder paint by Just Stop Oil","By Leigh Boobyer",2024-06-19,"Part of Stonehenge has been covered in orange powder paint by protesters. Two Just Stop Oil campaigners sprayed the powder paint on the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday. The move comes the day before celebrations begin for the Summer Solstice at the 5,000-year-old landmark. Wiltshire Police confirmed two people had been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. Just Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and it would ""wash away with rain"". The group named the two protesters as Niamh Lynch, a 21-year-old student from Oxford, and Rajan Naidu, a 73-year-old from Birmingham, in a statement. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the incident as a “disgraceful act of vandalism”. Leader of the Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer said the damage was ""outrageous"" and described Just Stop Oil as ""pathetic"". Members of the public were heard shouting ""no"" and seen running to intervene as the campaigners ran up to the stone circle at the Unesco world heritage site. Nick Merriman, chief executive of English Heritage, said the vandalism was ""deeply saddening"". He told the BBC's Today programme the stones are ""testament to people's desire to connect to nature"", and while he respected the rights of people to protest, he hoped they would channel their activism away from museum sites in future.  BBC correspondent, Paul Clifton, the first reporter to get to the scene shortly after the incident, said the three stones closest to the public path were ""splattered"" with the powder. He added that many of the tourists visiting the monument were ""slightly bemused"". ""Stonehenge managers and security guards are standing by the path,"" he said. ""I've heard a suggestion that because it is powder paint and the weather is dry and sunny, it may perhaps be removed without lasting damage, but they will need experts to inspect the stone before forming an opinion."" Just Stop Oil said the motivation behind the incident was to demand the next UK government end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. A spokesperson for the group said: ""Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. ""We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything."" Mark Verbinnen, councillor for Amesbury East and Bulford, arrived at the site a few minutes after the incident. He said many members of staff at the site were left ""shaken"", particularly one who attempted to tackle a protester. Mike Pitts, archaeologist and author of How to Build Stonehenge, said the impact of the action was ""potentially quite concerning"". He said: “The monument has been fenced off for decades and the megaliths' surfaces are protected. ""They are sensitive and they are completely covered in prehistoric markings which remain to be fully studied and any surface damage to the stones is hugely concerning. “A rich garden of life has grown on the megaliths, an exceptional lichen garden has grown. So it’s potentially quite concerning.” The orange powder was removed from the stones using blown air, which has helped preserve the rare lichen on the surface of the stones, Mr Merriman confirmed. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ""We responded to a report that orange paint had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects. ""Our enquiries are ongoing and we are working closely with English Heritage.""","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw44mdee0zzo",1
"5","Silverstone track invaders await appeal ruling","By Martin Heath and PA Media",2024-06-27,"Five Just Stop Oil activists who disrupted the 2022 British Grand Prix must wait to discover if they have successfully challenged their public nuisance convictions. Three of the protesters got onto the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire during the race. At an appeal hearing on Wednesday, the group's lawyers argued their convictions were ""unsafe"". Three appeal court judges will give a written ruling at a later date. Alasdair Gibson, Louis McKechnie, David Baldwin, Emily Brocklebank and Joshua Smith were convicted at Northampton Crown Court last year of risking ""serious harm"" to drivers and race marshals during the track invasion. They had all denied causing a public nuisance and argued they had followed a ""meticulous"" safety plan. McKechnie, 23, and Brocklebank, 26, have previous convictions for gluing themselves to the frame of a £70m Van Gogh painting days before the F1 protest. They were given suspended prison sentences of 12 months and six months respectively, both suspended for two years. Baldwin, who is 48, Gibson, 23, and Smith, 30, were handed 12-month community orders. At the appeal hearing, the group's lawyers argued their convictions were ""unsafe"". The protesters' lawyers argued that only a ""handful"" of individuals were potentially put at risk by their actions, which did not amount to an impact on ""a section of the public"" as required by the relatively-new public nuisance offence. Nadesh Karu, representing Smith and Brocklebank, said Silverstone's Wellington Straight, where the track invasion took place, was not open to the public. He added that prosecutors accepted the 115,000 spectators were not at risk of serious harm. Simon Jones, for the Crown Prosecution Service, told the court: ""From the moment each individual jumped the first fence, they were going into a dangerous prohibited area,"" he said. ""There were clearly sections of the public who were at risk."" Brocklebank, of Yeadon, Leeds, Gibson, from Aberdeen, McKechnie, from Manchester, and Smith, from Oldham, went on to the race circuit during the protest. Baldwin, from Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, the only member of the five to attend court, was found in a car park along with glue, cable ties and a Just Stop Oil banner. Lord Justice Holroyde said appeal judges needed to reflect on legal arguments, adding that the cases took the court into ""new territory"".","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkygxyrl3zo",1
"6","Dozens of campaigners held over alleged airport plans",NA,2024-06-28,"Dozens of Just Stop Oil supporters suspected of planning to disrupt airports this summer have been arrested across England. The Metropolitan Police said 27 people were taken into custody, including some believed to be ""key organisers"" for the climate group. Six arrests were made in east London, four at Gatwick airport, and the rest from forces across the country. The force added the six who were arrested on Thursday evening at a community centre in London were there ""as part of a publicly-advertised event promoting airport disruption"". The operation took place in Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Devon, Essex, Manchester, Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk and West Yorkshire, a Met spokesperson said. The 27 were detained under the Public Order Act which makes it illegal to conspire to disrupt national infrastructure. Four people arrested on Tuesday after being identified at Gatwick Airport and have since been released on bail.  Ch Supt Ian Howells added: “We know Just Stop Oil are planning to disrupt airports across the country this summer which is why we have taken swift and robust action now. ""Our stance is very clear that anyone who compromises the safety and security of airports in London can expect a strong response from officers or security staff. ""Airports are complex operating environments which is why we are working closely with them, agencies and other partners on this operation."" Suspects released on bail are subject to conditions which include not travelling within one kilometre of any UK airport unless passing by while on a mode of transport. In response to the wave of arrests, a Just Stop Oil spokesman said: ""It isn’t a massive surprise."" He added that disruption is necessary because people are ""dropping dead around the world"" from extreme heat, and ""tipping points"" are being passed.","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce98dqn19plo",1
"7","Heathrow Airport granted court order against protests","By James W Kelly & PA Media",2024-07-09,"Heathrow Airport has been granted a High Court injunction against potential environmental protesters on the site. On Tuesday, lawyers for the airport appeared before a judge in London to ask for an order preventing demonstrators from trespassing on the site. Katharine Holland KC, for the airport, told the court that the site was a ""clear and obvious target for planned disruptive action"" by protesters affiliated with Just Stop Oil and ""other environmental campaigns"". It follows two Just Stop Oil activists being arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after appearing to spray orange paint over private jets at Stansted Airport. Ms Holland said Heathrow Airport was featured in a video published on the Just Stop Oil website, which represented ""the identification of a specific threat to this location"". The court was told that the airport - Europe's busiest - handles more than 1,300 flights and about 227,000 passengers on average daily, with the actions of potential protesters risking ""significant"" harm. In written submissions, Ms Holland continued: ""There would also be severe disruption to passengers, and the proper operations of the airport more generally."" At the end of the hearing, Mr Justice Julian Knowles granted the injunction, which lasts for five years and will be reviewed every 12 months. He said: ""If these protesters want to stand on public land near the entrances to Heathrow Airport then they can do. ""What they can't do is go on to private land and do it."" Following the hearing, a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said: ""We agree that aviation must decarbonise, however disrupting people's well-earned travel plans with irresponsible action is not the way to deliver the transition to net zero. ""This isn't a decision we've taken lightly, but we cannot condone activity that endangers the safety of our passengers and colleagues."" The move comes days after Stansted, Manchester and East Midlands airports were given similar injunctions against would-be protesters.","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c97dqx2wy9vo",1

Campaigners sprayed the substance on the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday 19 June. A man aged in his 30s, from Essex, was detained by Met Police officers on Thursday.

Just Stop Oil protesters sprayed orange powder from a fire extinguisher, stopping the wedding party as they left Chester Cathedral last month. At a meeting on Friday Cheshire police and crime commissioner Dan Price will be asked to explain how this happened. The panel will also ask the full cost to the force of policing the event, which was also supported by neighbouring forces. In a written question already submitted to the commissioner, the county's police and crime panel has asked if an investigation has been carried out into the ""lapse in security which led to the offence where protesters managed to expel two fire extinguishers"". The question goes on to ask if there has been an ""acceptance that this situation was an unacceptable security lapse which could have resulted in a much worse and more dangerous outcome"" for the police officers, wedding guests and to the wider public.

"12","Orange powder paint sprayed on Stonehenge is removed","By Leigh Boobyer",2024-06-20,"Orange powder paint sprayed on to part of Stonehenge by activists has been removed. Two Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested, after spraying the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, with cornflour at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday. English Heritage chief executive, Dr Nick Merriman, said there appeared to be ""no visible damage"" to the 5,000-year-old landmark after experts cleaned the site. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Merriman also confirmed the site would be open for summer solstice celebrations as normal from 19:00 BST on Thursday. Wiltshire Police said the two protesters were released on bail ""to allow us additional time to work with specialists and progress our enquiries"". They had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity. English Heritage said the orange paint had been removed using a ""specialist handheld blower"". It told the BBC that if rain had come into contact with the powder, damage could have been significant. The stones are covered in more than fifty different lichens, some of them rare. This meant brushing or washing the paint off was not possible. An English Heritage spokesperson said: “We can’t understand why anyone who professes to care for the environment would attempt to harm such a monument and to distress people from all over the world, including those for whom Stonehenge holds a spiritual significance.” Dr Merriman said: ""It's difficult to understand and we're deeply saddened about this vandalism, but we've been really touched by the messages of sympathy and support we've had. ""Our experts have already managed to clean the orange powder from the stones because we were really worried about what would happen if they got in contact with water. ""So far, there seems to be no visible damage. The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow."" Dr Merriman called the act ""vandalism to one of the world's most celebrated ancient monuments"". He added: ""We wish people would channel their protests away from cultural heritage sites, museums and galleries because we feel that doesn't actually help their cause, and causes huge upset and disruption to the operation of these important sites.""

"14","Newspaper headlines: 'Slip N Slide incident' and Stonehenge drama",NA,2024-06-22,"Headlines on local websites and newspapers in the West of England have been dominated by a mixture of Glastonbury Festival news and Stonehenge. Earlier in the week, Bristol Live's network content editor Steven Smith reported on the Just Stop Oil campaigners spraying Stonehenge with an orange paint. He explained how members of the public tried to intervene during the incident near Salisbury on Wednesday - the day before the Summer Solstice. The Swindon Advertiser also covered this and a day later wrote an article on the successful removal of the paint. It said a ""specialist handheld blower"" was used to clean the orange cornflour paint from the ancient monument. Early Friday morning brought a flurry of photographs from news outlets across the west on the summer solstice celebrations, where around 15,000 gathered at Stonehenge to watch the sunrise. The Wiltshire Times reported King Arthur Pendragon, a senior druid and pagan priest, had disapproved of the action earlier in the week. But explained this did not diminish the celebrations for those attending which he said included people from “every single continent”. The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald reported a group of people dressed as Mexican mushrooms took nine days to travel to the site. With only a handful of days to go until the gates of Glastonbury Festival open to revellers, Somerset Live kept a close eye on all of the weather reports. Content editor Daniel Clark reported on Great Western Railway revealing its 'Shania Train' ahead of the event. The new train will be used to drop off some of the thousands of festival-goers set to descend upon Castle Cary station next week. The Somerset Gazette, shared a special ""star filled"" photograph"" inspired by the festival's Pyramid Stage. In other news, a special tribute film for Wilf 'the egg man' Peddle' made by Tor Theatre was shared on the Normal For Glastonbury, Facebook page. Somerset Live, reported an air ambulance airlifted a boy to hospital after he got injured at the Slip N Slide attraction in Frome. Bristol Live, published an article on the latest in the Bristol Downs van dwellers saga where caravans and vehicles parked on the beauty spot were told to leave within the next two weeks.

"15","'Tory wipeout' and 'nothing sacred'",NA,2024-06-20,"The Guardian leads on Labour plans to close the gender pay gap. In an interview with the paper, Rachel Reeves says she'll make flexible working the norm if she breaks the ""last glass ceiling in politics"" and becomes the UK's first female chancellor. Noting that a woman has never been in charge of the nation's finances before, she tells the paper she she feels a ""big responsibility"" to solve inequality in the workplace ""once and for all."" ""Tory Wipeout"" is the headline in the Daily Telegraph. An opinion poll for the paper suggests both Rishi Sunak, and the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, are at risk of losing their seats at the election.  According to the analysis - by the research companies Savanta and Electoral Calculus - around three quarters of the cabinet could be voted out. Analysing the results of the poll, the Telegraph's associate editor, Gordon Rayner, says Kemi Badenoch could become the future of the Conservative party ""by default"" - as the only ""big beast"" in the cabinet left standing. The results of another, YouGov poll of 35,000 voters is the main story in the Times. The seat-by-seat analysis suggests Labour are on course to win the biggest majority of any party in a century - with the Conservatives haemorrhaging support to Reform and the Lib Dems. The Financial Times says the latest figures on inflation ""delivered a filip"" to the prime minister, as he seeks to ""turn around"" his party's election campaign. Hitting the two per cent target for the first time in three years marks what it calls a ""milestone for the economy."" The Sun calls it ""Rishi's reward"" - for fighting off crazy union pay demands in the NHS. The Daily Mirror says he deserves no credit - given so many households are still struggling to make ends meet. The Daily Mail reports that the Post Office has published on its website the full names and addresses of 555 sub-postmasters, wrongly accused of fraud in the Horizon IT scandal. The paper says it appears to have uncovered a ""staggering data breach"" - described by some of the victims as another ""betrayal."" The confidential list has now been taken down. The Post Office said it had begun an investigation. ""Is nothing sacred?"" the Mail asks, on its front page, after Just Stop Oil protestors sprayed the Stonehenge with orange paint. The paper says the stunt, by what it calls ""eco fanatics"", caused outrage on the eve of the summer solstice. ""Just lock them up"" is the headline in the Daily Express. The paper carries a comment piece by the home secretary, James Cleverly, who describes what happened as a ""reckless and idiotic assault on the fabric of our nation"" - by what he calls ""hemp-wearing hoodlums."" The Times reports on what it says is the first ever scientific experiment on one of the most talked about consequences of the coronavirus pandemic - the rise of working from home. The randomised trial, involving more than 16 hundred workers at a Chinese technology company, sought to establish whether work from home makes employees more productive - or gives the lazy an excuse to slack off. The conclusion: staff who are allowed to stay home for part of the week are no more efficient than those who stay in the office....but they are happier.

It is one of the rare occasions people can get close to the stones at the historic site near Salisbury in Wiltshire. It went ahead as normal after Just Stop Oil protestors sprayed orange powder paint on the stones on Wednesday. English Heritage has removed the paint with a specialist air blower, but if rain had come into contact with it, there could have been significant damage. The charity's historic properties director Kate Logan said: ""I think all the people who attended solstice today were just really pleased to come and see the stones looking spectacular. The incident is behind us now. ""We're really thrilled with how the event has gone this year. We don't often get such a glorious sunrise but today we've been very lucky."" People come from all over the world to see the summer solstice at the 5,000 year old site. Tammy McCollam said she had travelled about 5,000 miles from Washington in the US specifically for the event. “It’s amazing. When I was able to touch the stones, it just felt so emotional, incredible. ""I just felt called to come, this is a bucket list trip.” The site opened on Thursday evening and there was a crowd for the sunset, with many staying throughout the night to watch the sunrise on Friday morning. The sounds of drumming and cheers from the crowd could be heard as the sun came up. Druids and other members of the pagan community gathered too, with the event a spiritual time for many. Carolyn Pare was one of the visitors and said: “There's a beautiful camaraderie and energy. It's a completely moving, spiritual experience to be here.” Wiltshire Police always has a presence at the event but after the Just Stop Oil protest, Deputy Chief Constable Craig Dibdin said they had immediately reviewed their plans with organisers and were happy with them. DCC Dibdin said it had been ""very safe"", with only been one arrest for a minor assault. ""It's been a really successful, good humoured event,"" he added.

Hugh Grosvenor, a godson of King Charles, married Olivia Henson at Chester's medieval cathedral on Friday - with Prince William attending as an usher. The duke is one of the richest men in the country, with a fortune estimated to be worth £10.1 billion. In a joint statement, the newlyweds said: ""We have been incredibly touched by everyone's amazing support and warm wishes."" About 400 guests, including Princess Eugenie and TV producer Phil Redmond, attended the wedding before a reception was held at the duke’s family estate at nearby Eaton Hall. The King and Queen were not present after travelling to France for D-Day commemorations, while the Princess of Wales did not attend as she continues to undergo cancer treatment. The Duke of Sussex was also not present. The couple said: ""We are deeply grateful to everyone who supported us yesterday and want to extend a special thank you to those in Chester who helped make our day so memorable."" People in the city centre were offered free ice creams in honour of the occasion, after the couple teamed up with three local independent businesses to provide the treats. The city’s annual Summer Flowers project was also funded by the duke and duchess, with 100,000 flowers planted as part of the wedding celebrations. The duke became a billionaire on inheriting his title and control of the Grosvenor Estate at the age of 25, following his father’s death in 2016. His firm, Grosvenor Group, owns property in London's wealthy Mayfair and Belgravia districts, as well as city centre developments such as the Liverpool One shopping centre. Two women, aged 69 and 73, were arrested after orange powder was released as guests left the ceremony.

"20","William among guests at Duke of Westminster's wedding","By Rumeana Jahangir, Chris Long & PA News",2024-06-07,"Thousands of well-wishers gathered in Chester for the wedding of the Duke of Westminster, where the Prince of Wales acted as an usher. Hugh Grosvenor, the godson of King Charles III, married Olivia Henson at the city's cathedral earlier. The 33-year-old duke is godfather to Prince George, but the 10-year-old could not join his father at the ceremony due to it falling on a school day. Two women were removed from the crowd by police after an orange plume was deployed from a fire extinguisher-type device as the couple left the cathedral. Campaign group Just Stop Oil said two of its supporters had used the device to project powder paint near the cathedral entrance as the newlyweds made their way to a car. Cheshire Police said two women, a 69-year-old from Manchester and 73-year-old from Suffolk, had been arrested on suspicion of public order offences and remained in custody. The duke is regarded as one of the richest people in the UK, with a fortune of about £10bn, while his bride has worked in the sustainable food and drinks industry. Along with being a godparent for Prince George, he is also reported to be godfather to the Duke of Sussex's son, Prince Archie. Prince Harry, who was an usher with his brother at the wedding of the duke’s sister Lady Tamara Grosvenor in 2004, is understood not to have attended the service by mutual agreement. The King and Queen Camilla did not attend the service, after travelling to Normandy for the D-Day commemorations on Thursday. The Princess of Wales, who is receiving treatment for cancer, also did not attend. The bride wore a dress and veil designed by Emma Victoria Payne, embroidered with floral motifs and edgings from Ms Henson's great-great-grandmother's veil from about 1880. The 31-year-old also wore a vintage tiara, incorporating a myrtle leaf design, which was made by the prestigious Russian jewellery craftmakers Fabergé for Grosvenor brides and has been worn on their wedding days since 1906. Her bouquet was made of flowers picked from the gardens of Eaton Hall, the duke's country house. Members of the public began arriving outside the cathedral from early in the morning, bringing camping chairs and picnics. By the time of the service, thousands were gathered outside the cathedral and in the surrounding streets and many of them witnessed the protest as the couple re-emerged. Barbara Williams, 81, from Cheshire, who was standing next to the protesters in the crowd, said she felt ""a bit shaken after it"". She said she and her friend Andrea Machin, 56, had been ""standing next to them all day"". ""They were already here when we arrived at 07:00 [and] they had shopping trolleys with them,"" Ms Machin said. ""Everyone was watching the bride and groom and then we just saw orange and they had what looked like a fire extinguisher with them. ""The police realised quite quickly what was happening and pulled them out. ""It happened just as William was coming out of the door."" In a statement issued by Just Stop Oil, the protesters said weddings were ""a time of coming together in celebration to make a commitment to the future"", but for ""countless millions around the world there is no future unless we come together to stop oil and gas"". A representative for the duke and Ms Henson said it meant ""a lot"" for them to marry in Chester, due to the Grosvenor family's ""long and close personal connection to both the cathedral and the city"". They said the couple had ""made a conscious effort to involve local and regional suppliers in several aspects of the day"". ""The couple have also been moved by the messages of support they have received from around the region and are hugely grateful that people want to share in their happiness,"" they added. The city’s annual Summer Flowers project has been funded by the couple, with 100,000 flowers planted as part of the wedding celebrations and they have also paid for free ice cream and sorbet from three local independent businesses to be given to visitors to Chester city centre through the day. Poppy, a student at the University of Chester, was one of those indulging in a free ice cream. She said it was ""great to see the people and the businesses together"". ""It’s really fun to get the students out in the city and involved,"" she added. The duke inherited his title and control of the Grosvenor Estate at the age of 25, following his father's death in 2016, and the couple announced their engagement in April 2023 after being together for two years.

"21","Tories accepted donation from Hester after Abbott row","By Henry Zeffman",2024-06-06,"The Conservative Party accepted a further donation from Frank Hester, after he had been accused of making racist comments about Labour's Diane Abbott. The businessman donated £150,000 to the party through his healthcare software company, The Phoenix Partnership, on 8 March. The donation was then formally accepted by the Tories on 14 March, according to the Electoral Commission. New figures released by the commission also confirm he donated £5m in January, before he became embroiled in the row. Mr Hester previously made £10m of donations to the Conservatives last year. In March – after the latest £5m was donated but before it was known about – the tech boss was thrust to the centre of a political controversy after claims he made comments to staff saying that Ms Abbott “should be shot”. The £150,000 donation was accepted the day after Rishi Sunak faced a volley of criticism at prime minister’s questions about Mr Hester. He condemned the alleged comments as “wrong” and “racist”, but made clear that the Conservatives would not return Mr Hester’s money. Mr Hester apologised for making ""rude"" comments about Ms Abbott but said his remarks ""had nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin"". He declined to comment when approached by the BBC about the latest donations. Ms Abbott accused Mr Sunak of ""pure hypocrisy"" for accepting donations from Mr Hester. ""If he really objected to Hester’s remarks Sunak would not still be taking his money,"" she told the BBC. Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said: ""Rishi Sunak has proven he is a man with no integrity. “He is too weak to return the money donated by a man who has made violent, misogynist, and racist remarks which belong nowhere near our politics."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “How low can Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives go? If the Conservatives spend this money they will be proudly funded by a man who made the most appalling racist and sexist comments. ""Ultimately the buck stops with Rishi Sunak. Sunak must personally intervene and make sure not a penny of this money is spent."" A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Mr Hester has rightly apologised for comments made in the past. ""As Mr Hester has apologised and shown contrition and we consider the matter resolved."" A number of former employees of Mr Hester have told the BBC he regularly made remarks they regarded as racist and sexist. Two of them said they recalled him making comments about Asian people. One said he referred to some staff as ""the Asian girls"". Another said he mimicked accents in meetings. Another ex-employee criticised the prime minister for accepting Mr Hester's apology, saying: ""It's not a one off... There was absolutely a culture of Frank making seriously awful comments."" All the former employees spoke to the BBC in March on the basis of anonymity. Mr Hester was by far the Conservatives’ biggest donor in the first quarter of 2024. The next biggest was Sir Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line, who gave the party £500,000. Other notable donors include the businessmen Lord Hintze and Lord Ashcroft, who each donated £50,000. In the same period Labour received £1.6m from Ecotricity, the company controlled by Dale Vince, taking his recent donations to the Labour Party to around £4m. Mr Vince attracted controversy last year after it emerged he had also donated to Just Stop Oil. He stopped funding the campaign group in October, saying their protests were “counterproductive”. Labour also accepted £700,000 from the hedge fund manager Martin Taylor. Away from the business world, the party received £180,000 from Grayson Perry and £85,000 from Maggi Hambling, both artists. by Daniel Wainwright, BBC Verify Mr Hester’s company was the source of more than half of all donations declared by the Conservatives in the first few months of 2024. Electoral Commission data shows the party received just under £9m from 189 sources, excluding public funds. Just over £5m of that was from Mr Hester’s company, the Phoenix Partnership. Mr Hester and his company also donated more than £10m declared in 2023. Total donations received by the Tories and declared the first quarter of 2024 were 26% down on the same period in 2023. Labour, meanwhile, has seen donations rise 67% (almost £3m more) in January to March 2024 compared with the same three months of 2023, donations to the Lib Dems are up by 83% (over £1m more) and donations to the Greens have doubled (rising by £181,000). Reform UK has declared £25,000 in donations but its former leader Richard Tice has previously loaned the party money, details of which are recorded separately from donations by the Electoral Commission. Labour’s biggest donor, electicity company Ecotricity, provided 22% of all donations the party registered in the first quarter of 2024. Ecotricity was founded by Dale Vince, who has also given money to Just Stop Oil. The largest sum donated to Labour by a union was £381,837 from Unite, but this was Labour’s fourth biggest source of donations in that three-month period. A total of £10m of donations from Mr Hester last year had already been revealed in the Electoral Commission register. There is a three-month lag before donations are made public by the commission. Tortoise Media reported in March that the Tories had received a further £5m from the businessman but the Tories had previously refused to confirm whether this was the case. Mr Hester allegedly said in 2019 that veteran MP Diane Abbott made him ""want to hate all black women"" and should ""be shot"". At the time the comments were reported, Ms Abbott was suspended from sitting as a Labour MP for saying Irish, Jewish and Traveller people were not subject to racism ""all their lives"". She withdrew her remarks and apologised ""for any anguish caused"". The row increased pressure on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to lift the suspension of Ms Abbott, who was the first black woman to be elected to Parliament. However, the former shadow home secretary and veteran left-winger, who is a close ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, was only readmitted to the party last week. There was still uncertainty over whether she would be allowed to run as Labour’s candidate in her former seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington until Sir Keir said she would be free to stand for the party on Friday.","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c900138vek4o",1

Edred Whittingham, 26, disrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on April 17, 2023 He was found guilty of causing criminal damage after a one-day trial at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Friday, A fellow protester, 53-year-old Margaret Reid, who tried to do the same thing on the theatre's other table, was convicted of attempting to cause criminal damage. A video clip played to the court showed Whittingham, known as Eddie, releasing the orange substance, which he said was dyed corn starch powder, and kneeling amid the balls on the table before being hauled off by security. The defendant told the court he believed his actions were ""reasonable and proportionate in the light of the greater threat we are facing from the climate crisis"". Whittingham, from Exeter, said: ""I didn't intend to cause damage, I intended to cause disruption."" Reid, a former museum worker, also denied trying to cause damage, saying she ""set out to draw attention to the dire situation that we are in"". ""We need shaking out of our stupor,"" she told the court. ""We need a shock. We need an action like we took to make us jump out of the pan."" Reid, from Kendal, in Cumbria, said she has protested ""politely"" in the past, voted and written to her MP but ""it hasn't worked"". Whittingham's actions caused £899.90 worth of damage to the table, the court heard. Completion of the first-round match was delayed until the following day as a result. Reid's attempts to disrupt the match on the other table, on which Mark Allen and Fan Zhengyi were playing, were foiled when she was tackled by referee Olivier Marteel. Both will be sentenced at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on 10 July. Max Hinchcliffe, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the pair ""showed an utter lack of thought or care for the players at the tournament or the fans watching from across the world"". He added: ""The law upholds the right to protest but this must be balanced against the rights of others and this case shows that when lawful protest crosses the line into criminality we won't hesitate to prosecute offenders.""","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckr5dy4zz5ro",1

"24","Move to extend police protest powers ruled unlawful","By Paul Seddon",2024-05-21,"An attempt by the government to widen police powers over protests has been ruled unlawful by the High Court. Legislation introduced last year under ex-home secretary Suella Braverman gave officers more leeway to stop disruption. But now two judges have ruled it did not have a proper legal basis, and the Home Office failed to consult properly on it. The department said it was ""disappointed"" and would be appealing. An accelerated appeal process will now take place, with an order quashing the legislation put on hold. The Home Office said it would ""consider all other options to keep this important power for police"". The timing of the ruling is awkward for ministers, who are considering new police powers to curtail pro-Palestinian marches. Campaign group Liberty, which brought the case, has called for police to refrain from using the powers until the appeal has been heard. In a statement, it called the ruling a ""victory for democracy"" that showed the government ""cannot step outside of the law to do whatever it wants"". The regulations, passed by MPs in June last year, lowered the threshold for what protest activity counts as ""serious disruption"" in England and Wales. It said any disruption that was ""more than minor"" should count - but campaigners argued this would give too much power to police. An official assessment of the law estimated the new definition could increase police intervention at protests by up to 50%. The move, announced amid the backdrop of disruptive protests by groups such as Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain, was controversial at the time. This was in part because the changes had already been rejected in the House of Lords six months before that. In a 56-page ruling, Lord Justice Green and Mr Justice Kerr said the legal basis underpinning the new powers was insufficient. It also said the Home Office had acted unlawfully by only asking police forces what they thought of the powers, rather than consulting more widely with the public and groups that might be affected. It comes as ministers consider recommendations from the government's adviser on political violence for tighter rules on public protests. In a report, Lord Walney, the former Labour MP John Woodcock, said it should be easier for police forces to ban demonstrations. He said this should include where they reasonably believe protests could lead to ""intimidation from threatening or abusive conduct"". He also suggested groups holding a ""significant number of large demonstrations"" could be asked to pay towards policing costs, and businesses affected by disruption should be able to get compensation. In a statement, Home Secretary James Cleverly said ministers would look at his recommendations ""over the coming weeks"".","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-69043611",1
"25","Gallery aims to challenge conversation about masterpiece","By Jenny Coleman",2024-05-21,"An exhibition aimed at ""challenging the conversation"" around a 17th Century masterpiece has opened in Liverpool. Diego Velazquez’s The Rokeby Venus has been loaned to the city's Walker Art Gallery as part of the National Gallery in London's 200th anniversary celebrations. A representative for the Liverpool venue said the work had ""long been a topic of public conversation and interest"" and the new display would ""challenge traditional views"" by setting it alongside ""unexpected artworks"". They said the National Treasures: Velazquez in Liverpool exhibition would ""consider new ways of seeing, focusing on the perspectives of women and queer people through a range of works that have rarely been displayed before"". The work by the Spanish old master has had several names, including The Toilet of Venus and The Mirror's Venus, but has become more commonly known by its nickname, which stems from its time hanging on the walls of Rokeby Park, a country house in County Durham. The work has been the subject of protests twice in the past 100 years - by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914 and by Just Stop Oil campaigners in 2023. The Walker's representative said it was Velazquez's only surviving female nude and was now considered an example of the objectification of women in art. Curators Melissa Gustin and Kate O’Donoghue said challenging the conversation around the ""iconic"" painting had given them ""a chance to spotlight the work of women and non-binary artists in our collection"". ""Velazquez acknowledges the woman’s gaze in this painting with Venus herself looking in the mirror,"" they said. The gallery said the exhibition around the masterpiece included The Spanish Gesture (1934) by Ethel Walker, a Scottish artist who has been ""celebrated as one of the earliest lesbian artists to openly express their sexuality in their paintings"" and Puck (1855-1859) by Harriet Goodhue Hosmer, an American sculptor ""who actively rejected the norms and social conventions expected of women"". They said a selection of photographs by South African artist Zanele Muholi, named Miss Lesbian VII (Amsterdam) and Miss Lesbian I (Amsterdam) (2009), and Rene Matić's examination of ""race, beauty, and gender"" Chiddy Doing Rene's Hair (2019) were also being displayed. The curators said the unveiling also marked the return of the masterpiece to the city after almost a century. “The Rokeby Venus first came to Liverpool in 1906 before being unveiled at the National Gallery in London, so it’s incredibly exciting to have her back in the city,"" they said. ""We are delighted to work in partnership with the National Gallery during their anniversary year and are grateful to them for this fantastic loan.""

"26","'Extreme' protest groups face ban under proposal","By Harry Farley",2024-05-12,"Protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations, under a proposal from the government’s adviser on political violence. An upcoming report from Lord Walney, which BBC News has seen extracts of, will recommend a new category for proscribing ""extreme protest groups"". It defines these as those which routinely use criminal tactics to try to achieve their aims. The sanctions could restrict a group's ability to fundraise and its right to assembly in the UK. The Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations. ""Militant groups like Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil are using criminal tactics to create mayhem and hold the public and workers to ransom without fear of consequence,"" Lord Walney said. ""Banning terror groups has made it harder for their activists to plan crimes - that approach should be extended to extreme protest groups too."" Just Stop Oil said the government were the “dangerous radicals that are endangering all of us” through their climate policies. Palestine Action claimed its actions were in line with most of the British public who want an arms embargo between the UK and Israel, and the proposals would not deter their campaign. The new restriction orders ""would be distinct from proscription on terrorism grounds"", the report will say. But the mechanism could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate. If a group’s actions were persistent, and used to promote a political or ideological cause, that would count against them, according to the recommendation. It will come as part of a review into tackling political violence by Lord Walney - the former Labour MP John Woodcock - which was commissioned three years ago, but is yet to be published. A government source said ministers shared Lord Walney’s objectives and would consider implementing his recommendations once the review was published. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Extremism of any kind has no place in our society and we will not tolerate tactics that set out to intimidate, threaten or cause disruption to the law-abiding majority. ""In recent months, we have also witnessed a small number of protesters display violent and hateful behaviour, and the police have our full support in tackling extremism and hate crime. “We are considering the report's recommendations extremely carefully and will respond in due course.”","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2qv7425gvwo",1

"28","Just Stop Oil doctor suspended for five months","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-23,"A doctor, arrested and jailed for her involvement in Just Stop Oil protests, has had her medical licence suspended for five months. Dr Sarah Benn, formerly a GP in Birmingham, was arrested after taking part in peaceful demonstrations at the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire. Dr Benn, who had already given up practising in August 2022, said that as a doctor, she had a moral duty to take action to protect life and health. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) imposed the suspension on Tuesday after ruling last week that Dr Benn's fitness to practise was impaired. The doctors' trade union, the British Medical Association (BMA), said it was ""very concerned"" that a doctor's participation in environmental protests amounted to professional misconduct. Dr Benn said: ""How could my patients trust me again, if I didn’t take action to confront the greatest health crisis we face?"" The General Medical Council (GMC), which referred the case, said the hearing was convened due to the fact her actions at the terminal broke the law, damaging public trust. Faye Rolfe, counsel for the GMC, said Dr Benn's conduct had brought the profession into disrepute. The tribunal said in its findings: ""The public must be able to trust that doctors will always act within the law."" The hearing related to three peaceful Just Stop Oil protests outside Kingsbury terminal in 2022, despite an injunction against them. A high court judge jailed Dr Benn for eight days on remand for protests on 26 April and 4 May, after she failed to answer her bail on 4 May and instead attended the demonstration. On 14 September, Dr Benn was arrested along with 51 others after obstructing a private access road, preventing vehicle access in and out of the terminal. She was sentenced to 32 days in prison. Dr Benn told the tribunal that traffic generally passed normally during the protests, and that if the road was closed for any duration, it was for police convenience rather than a necessity. Dr Benn had previously taken part in climate change protests in September and October 2019, but the GMC closed that case and advised her to ""reflect on her actions"". Dr Emma Runswick, BMA deputy chair of council, had said there was ""no possible public or patient interest"" for a tribunal where potential sanctions included the removal of a doctor's licence in these circumstances. Dr Runswick said: ""Climate change has been declared the biggest potential health crisis in the world by the World Health Organisation (WHO)."" A spokesperson for the Doctors' Association UK said: ""This is a story of a clinician being punished for raising serious concerns about dangerous inaction on the greatest threat to global health we have ever, or will ever experience. ""The right to peaceful protest is a basic human right. It cannot and must not be taken away. ""Given the evidence on climate change and its health impacts, we strongly believe that peaceful protest should not be viewed as condemnable professional misconduct – but as commendable public health advocacy.""

"29","Ruling against Just Stop Oil doctor alarms BMA","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-22,"The British Medical Association (BMA) has said it is ""very concerned"" by a tribunal's finding that a doctor who was arrested after peacefully participating in Just Stop Oil protests had committed professional misconduct. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service ruled Dr Sarah Benn's fitness to practise was impaired and said it must consider whether a sanction should be imposed on her registration. The General Medical Council (GMC), which referred the case, said the hearing was convened due to the fact her actions at Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire broke the law and resulted in her imprisonment. But Dr Emma Runswick, BMA deputy chair of council, said there was ""no possible public or patient interest"" in such circumstances for proceedings where potential sanctions included the removal of a doctor's licence. Addressing the tribunal's findings, Dr Runswick said the BMA was concerned Dr Benn’s registration as a doctor could be threatened for taking part in peaceful protests relating to the climate change emergency. She said: ""Climate change has been declared the biggest potential health crisis in the world by the World Health Organisation (WHO). ""The reality is that cases such as this risk adding to the sense of fear doctors hold about the GMC and the medical practitioner tribunals. ""We hope that simple common sense will prevail in this case, as maintaining the high standards and good reputation of the medical profession will not be progressed by taking action against those taking part in peaceful climate change action."" The tribunal related in total to three protests Just Stop Oil conducted outside the terminal on 26 April 2022, 4 May 2022, and 14 September 2022. An injunction had previously been granted against people participating in climate change protests in the locality. A high court judge sentenced Dr Benn to eight days on remand in custody for the events of 26 April and 4 May 2022, after she failed to answer her bail on 4 May and instead attended a protest at the terminal. On 14 September, Dr Benn was arrested along with 51 others after obstructing a private access road, preventing vehicle access in and out of the terminal. For that, she received a 32-day prison sentence. Dr Benn told the hearing the British Medical Journal had called on governments to act urgently on climate, especially those in wealthier countries such as the UK.

Mark Jenkinson's constituency base in Maryport was covered in posters reading ""Stop Tory Coal"" at about 08:10 BST on Friday.

"31","Just Stop Oil doctor's fitness to practise 'impaired'","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-19,"A tribunal has found a doctor's fitness to practise to be impaired due to misconduct after she was involved in a number of Just Stop Oil protests. Dr Sarah Benn, a GP in Birmingham until 2022, was arrested after taking part in demonstrations at the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire. The General Medical Council (GMC) said the proceedings were not brought as a reaction to her participation in protests, but the fact that her actions broke the law and resulted in her imprisonment. The tribunal said it must now consider what sanction, if any, to impose on the doctor’s registration. Dr Benn said as a doctor, she had a moral duty to take action to protect life and health and that the climate emergency was a health emergency which was ""happening now"". At the tribunal, the 57-year-old referred to the British Medical Journal and stated they were calling on governments and leaders to act urgently on climate change, especially those in wealthier countries such as the UK. She also submitted that there was evidence that non-violent direct action helped to change policy and law, and that this had been proven by history, citing the example of the Suffragette movement. She added: ""How could my patients trust me again, if I didn’t take action to confront the greatest health crisis we face?"" Ms Rolfe, acting as counsel on behalf of the GMC, said that Dr Benn's conduct had brought the profession into disrepute because she had broken the law by failing to comply with the injunction against protests at the Kingsbury oil terminal on multiple occasions. She added that Dr Benn's fitness to practise was impaired as her conduct failed to justify patients' trust in the profession. Ms Rolfe submitted that it was not the taking part in protests the GMC had issue with, but the risk to the public's trust in and respect for doctors by seeing a doctor flouting the law and openly stating her intention to keep breaking the law. She added that while Dr Benn had stated there may be members of the public who, both now and in the future, will agree with what she had done, there will also be groups of society, ""that do not agree, do not understand, and can never understand"". The tribunal said in its findings: ""The public must be able to trust that doctors will always act within the law."" The hearing related to three peaceful protests Just Stop Oil conducted outside the Kingsbury oil terminal on 26 April 2022, 4 May 2022, and 14 September 2022. An injunction had previously been granted against people participating in climate change protests in the locality of the terminal. A high court judge sentenced Dr Benn to eight days on remand in custody for the events of 26 April and 4 May, after she failed to answer her bail on 4 May and instead attended a protest at the terminal. On 14 September, Dr Benn was arrested along with 51 others after obstructing a private access road, preventing vehicle access in and out of the terminal. As a result of this, she received a sentence of 32 days imprisonment.  Dr Benn spent the majority of her career as a GP in inner city Birmingham and as a GP trainer and undergraduate tutor. During the pandemic, she worked remotely for NHS 111, the Worcestershire COVID Management Service, and on-site at her practice. She continued to work as a GP at Hollyoaks Medical Centre in Birmingham until 2022, ceasing clinical work in April 2022 and relinquishing her licence to practise in August 2022. Dr Benn said that since 2022 she has devoted the majority of her time to environmental activism and voluntary work. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"32","Just Stop Oil: Protesters guilty aggravated trespass at Les Misérables show","By Jess Warren & PA Media",2024-04-19,"Five Just Stop Oil protesters have been found guilty of aggravated trespass after they stormed a performance of Les Misérables in London's West End. Two of the activists were also found guilty of criminal damage after standing on the theatre's orchestra pit netting. The show at Sondheim Theatre was halted at 21:00 GMT on 5 October 2023, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. The estimated cost to the theatre of cancelling the performance was £60,000. The protesters entered the stage during a performance of Do You Hear The People Sing? and locked themselves to the set. The ""angry"" audience of around 1,000 people was asked to leave the auditorium and the performance was brought to a halt around an hour later after police removed the activists. Having denied the charge, Hannah Taylor, 23, Lydia Gribbin, 28, Hanan Ameur, 22, Noah Crane, 18, and Poppy Bliss, 19, were found guilty of aggravated trespass following a trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Gribbin and Crane were additionally found guilty of causing £2,000 worth of criminal damage to the theatre's orchestra pit netting which is designed to protect the musicians below from objects falling off the stage. The court was told the netting had suffered ""structural damage"" from the weight of the two protesters standing on it. The cost of repairing the damage and refunding the audience was covered by the theatre's insurance, the court heard. Asked how the audience had reacted to the group disrupting the performance, theatre manager Daniel Lewis told the court: ""I heard frustration, I heard anger, I heard swearing."" Giving evidence, Gribbin said she did not want the orchestra pit to be damaged by the protest and believed it would be safe to stand on the netting. Les Miserables company manager Matt Byham said he was ""angry"" the protest had happened when a child actor was on stage. All five protesters will be sentenced at a later date.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-68856354",1

Mark Jenkinson's constituency office on Senhouse Street in Maryport was targeted by protesters at about 08:10 BST on Friday, who covered the windows in posters reading ""Stop Tory Coal"". Two women have been arrested following the protest, which was against plans for a new coal mine in West Cumbria. Just Stop Oil branded Mr Jenkinson's comments ""adolescent"". Mr Jenkinson, the Conservative MP for Workington, called the protesters ""plonkers"" in a social media post criticising their actions. Speaking to the BBC, he described the protesters as ""entitled morons who think they are above the law"".  He said the window cleaner, who had just left, had to return to clean-up ""after these overgrown attention-seeking babies"". “Unfortunately, the film on the glass has been scratched and some of the paintwork damaged by the childish antics of these spoilt, middle-class climate clowns,"" he added. He further criticised the protesters who he said had driven to the area in cars that run on fossil fuels, used plastic tape and paper made from the felling of trees, as well as leaving items behind for others to clean-up.  Cumbria Police said it was investigating reports a window had been damaged by an adhesive. A woman in her 40s and another in her 60s have been both arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Mr Jenkinson added: ""I have it on good authority that the ringleader is spending some carbon neutral time in the cells. “They deliberately picked a sitting Friday because they thought I wouldn’t be here – but as it happens I was, and I gave them a few choice Anglo-Saxon words before they scuttled back to their hiding places as most people head to work.” In response Just Stop Oil said opening a new coal mine in Cumbria was ""total madness"".

"34","GP could be struck off after Just Stop Oil protest","By Eleanor Lawson",2024-04-18,"A doctor could be struck off the medical register after taking part in a Just Stop Oil demonstration. Dr Sarah Benn, a GP from Birmingham, was arrested after taking part in a demonstration at the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire in 2022. Dr Benn held a sign saying ""no new oil"" and was subsequently found to be in breach of a civil injunction and was imprisoned for 31 days, Just Stop Oil said. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) started the hearing to decide if the 57-year-old can maintain her licence to practise medicine on Monday, with the tribunal expected to last until 24 April. Just Stop Oil described the demonstration in Kingsbury as a ""peaceful demonstration demanding the government to bring an end to new fossil fuel projects"". On its listing of the hearing, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service says: ""The tribunal will inquire into the allegation that on 26 April 2022, 4 May 2022 and 14 September 2022, Dr Benn engaged in peaceful protests within a prohibited buffer zone at Kingsbury Oil Terminal in breach of an interim injunction granted on 14 April 2022. ""It is alleged that Dr Benn’s actions amounted to contempt of court and resulted in a custodial sentence."" According to Just Stop Oil, Dr Benn informed the General Medical Council and her employer after each arrest and she argues that her actions are consistent with medical ethics, which prioritise patient and public safety above all. The environmental activist group said three GPs are under scrutiny for similar reasons this year, with Dr Benn’s case being the first heard. Speaking before the hearing, Dr Benn said: ""As a doctor, my fundamental duty is to protect health and life. This includes proactive efforts to prevent disease and death. ""The climate crisis is the most significant existential threat to global health we have ever faced. “This is why I felt compelled to address what I see as the most critical health crisis currently unfolding—one that is already causing widespread death, disease, and destruction globally and is set to worsen."" Dr Benn said she did not take the protests and disruptions she had participated in lightly and she found no joy in causing inconvenience or distress. But she said people ""must be clear about the magnitude of the crisis we face"". ""The disruptions caused by peaceful protest are nothing compared to the catastrophic impacts of continuing to burn fossil fuels,"" she said. ""I will be sad and upset if I am removed from the register, but that will have no effect on my future plans.

"35","Energy secretary Claire Coutinho defends government's climate record","By Kate Whannel",2024-04-21,"Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho has defended the government's environmental record following criticism from the outgoing boss of the climate watchdog. Head of the Climate Change Committee, Chris Stark, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that Rishi Sunak had ""set us back"" on climate change. Ms Coutinho said the government had a ""very strong track record of delivery"". However, she also said it did not want to ""heap costs on families"" in its pursuit of net zero targets. The UK is committed by law to ensuring that by 2050 its emissions will be net zero - meaning the country will no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide and methane - in the atmosphere. Last year, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a major shift in the government's approach - including delaying a ban on new petrol and diesel cars and weakening targets on phasing out gas boilers. Labour in February rowed back an earlier commitment on environmental project spending buy a shadow minister told the BBC the party still has ""incredibly ambitious plans"". The Climate Change Committee provides independent advice to ministers and monitors its progress on targets. Mr Stark, who is due to stand down from the body, told the BBC the ""diplomatic impact"" of Mr Sunak's announcement had been ""immense"". ""The overall message was that the UK is less ambitious than it once was."" Asked about his comments, Ms Coutinho said the UK was the first country of all major economies to halve its emissions since 1990. She said that since coming into her role in 2023, she had made changes to the tax system to boost investment in the energy sector. However, she also argued that the government would take ""a sensible and pragmatic"" approach to achieving net zero. She said she did not want to ""heap costs on families"" particularly when ""other countries are polluting a lot more"". Broadcaster and environmental campaigner Chris Packham said he understood the government were ""giving people room to breathe"" but asked: ""What about their children, what about their grandchildren."" He said clean energy needed to be affordable for people but argued that if the Conservative government had invested more in renewables when it came to power in 2010, the UK would be in a better position now. Mr Packham also defended environmental protests after Mr Stark said campaigners were often ""their own worst enemy"". In recent years some climate change groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion have carried out disruptive protests to promote their cause. The Springwatch presenter said: ""When it comes to climate protests - sometimes we have made mistakes"" adding that the methods had occasionally prevented the message from getting across. However, he said it was important to have a ""radical flank"" and that disruptive protests by groups such as Just Stop Oil prompted people to contribute to ""less radical"" organisations. In his interview, Mr Stark also urged Labour to be more ""bold"" on climate change, saying that, compared to his shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband, the party leader Sir Keir Starmer ""doesn't talk about it quite so much"". Earlier this year, Labour announced it would be ditching its policy of spending £28bn a year on its green investment plan, but still wanted to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. Appearing on the same programme, shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood said her party had had to ""scale back"" its plans, blaming the ""likely economic inheritance"" from the Conservatives. However, she insisted that had not stopped Labour from having ""incredibly ambitious plans"" including its 2030 target. She acknowledged that, under a Labour government, there would still be a ""strategic gas reserve for when the wind and sun are not available"".","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68868296",1
"36","Newspaper headlines: Posh Spice at 50 and calls for 'Met chief to resign'","By BBC News",2024-04-21,"The Sunday Telegraph leads on calls for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, to resign, after one of his officers accused a man of being ""openly Jewish"" during a pro-Palestinian protest. Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden is quoted acknowledging that the police ""have a hugely difficult job"" - but he suggests the Met has been ""disrespecting"" Jews. In a separate article in the Telegraph, the former Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, argues that Sir Mark must go. She claims there is ""too much fear and even more favouritism"" in the way the Met polices pro-Palestinian protests. Writing in the Sunday Times, the man who was warned he could be arrested, Gideon Falter, says Sir Mark has to go, because he's lost the control of the streets. Mr Falter states that: ""It's not just that central London is a no-go zone for Jews, but a police-enforced, Jew-free zone."" According to the Observer, Labour is launching a new campaign to win over Tory-supporting pensioners ahead of the local elections in England next month. The paper says the party has detected alarm among older people about the impact a Conservative tax-cutting pledge could have on pensions and the NHS. Senior Labour figures are said to believe that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt made a huge blunder when he said his party wanted to abolish National Insurance contributions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written an article in the Telegraph, saying that he is proud to be English and that his party will celebrate St George's day on Tuesday ""with enthusiasm"". The paper suggests the article is a bold attempt to outmanoeuvre the Conservatives on the issue of national identity. It's also described as a ""slapdown"" to those in his own party, who've criticised Labour's use of patriotic symbols in its campaigning. Writing in the Sunday Express, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride and Health Secretary Victoria Atkins defend the government's plan to tackle what they call ""the sick note culture"". They say it's unacceptable that huge numbers of people are repeatedly being signed-off work, and not given the opportunity to discuss what adjustments could be put in place to help them carry on in their job. Separately the Express says the Home Office is preparing a list of 200 asylum seekers who'll be on the first deportation flight to Rwanda. The paper says more than 24,000 people have been told they are being considered for removal. Both the Sunday People and Sunday Mirror say climate change activists from the group Just Stop Oil are plotting to cause misery for thousands of holidaymakers this summer. According to the reports, they are preparing to storm airports across the UK and Europe, and glue themselves to runways and clamber onto jets. The Mirror says an undercover reporter heard about the plans at a meeting attended by hardcore activists. And the Mail on Sunday says the King is planning to attend Royal Ascot in June, despite his cancer treatment. The paper says he's told courtiers that he wants to honour his late mother, who missed only one Ascot during her 70-year reign. The Mail says he may also attend Trooping the Colour.

"37","Offshore Energies UK report: Oil and gas fight for survival","By Douglas Fraser",2024-03-26,"If only everything could be reduced to a three-word slogan: ""Take Back Control"" or ""Yes We Can"". The ""Just Stop Oil"" campaign group tells us it's a question of justice and it's simple - ""just"" like that. The fossil fuels industry is struggling to find a simple response. With equal and opposite simplification, it could be ""You'll Need Us"". But the argument set out in the annual business report of Offshore Energies UK is much more complex than that. And in the battle for the survival of the oil and gas industry in British waters, the stakes are high. That yearly report used to be an upsum of industry drilling activity and investment plans, with big, impressive numbers for employment and impact. This one admits that the previous £200bn investment forecast for this decade now look more like £160bn, and that's if politicians get off their case. A lot of that is yet to be committed, and industry is proving reluctant to make that commitment while Britain battles over the pace of transition to net zero carbon emissions. This year's report is more of an argument against execution - a plea of mitigation by an industry that has swiftly moved from blue chip to polluting pariah. With four recent tax rises from Conservatives, and Labour wanting to go further with the windfall tax as well as putting the brakes on new licences for drilling, OEUK says Britain is looking increasingly ""uninvestable"". It is reminding the government today that it thought it secured a North Sea Transition Deal three years ago, but doesn't recognise it in the more hostile environment it now faces. The trade body last month made its case to Labour's Treasury team, and says the discussions continue. But it also knows it has to win hearts and minds across the public too. The big carrot of a smooth and successful transition from fossil fuels to renewables could be £450bn of investment by 2040, and many jobs that could go with that. More than half of that big number would be offshore wind power, if governments and regulators can secure the best possible sequence of planning consents and grid connections. A big 'if'. Hydrogen could be worth £25bn - much of it using renewable power, much of it cracking gas. The prospect here is growth to equal the scale of the electricity industry by the middle of the century. Carbon capture and storage could bring £34bn in investment. The controversial bit is the £145bn that the industry reckons could still be invested in oil and gas under British waters. It is emphasised this is not the value of the industry for the big producers associated with outrageously large profits, but the contract value to the supply chain. There is likely to be more public sympathy and a lot more jobs in the companies supplying services and making more modest profits, across drilling, engineering, logistics, shipping, cables and catering, as well as finance, accountancy, law and geology expertise. How many jobs? The OEUK says 200,000 are supported by oil and gas, and UK ministers use that figure to make the case for drilling with more vigour. But the number is being contested by anti-oil campaigners, suggesting that the economic argument is getting some traction. The next bit of the industry's case is that oil and gas should be allowed to keep drilling while it makes the transition into renewable energies. It has mapped skills from one to the other, reckoning oil and gas can provide between 60 and 80% of the expertise required. Ditch that expertise before the renewables investment ramps up, goes the argument, and Britain will have to import skills and equipment, as it already does in large-scale fabrication and shipbuilding. Conversely, retain those skills, deploy them in renewables, and there will be an export market within 15 years worth more than £1,000bn. That's another suspiciously round number. The part of the argument that affects us all is that there is nothing simple about ""just"" stopping oil and gas, when our collective demand and the need for it remains so high. The industry doesn't quite say it, but there's a subliminal message: you depend on our produce, so don't blame us for giving you what you want, and need to lubricate your economy, keep you warm through the winter and go on holiday. Of all the UK's energy needs - across transport, heating, industry and power - oil and gas accounted for around 74% last year. From 2022, demand for gas was down 11% and oil was up 2%, mainly because more planes were flying post-pandemic. Even on the 'balanced pathway' to net zero by 2050, which has been set out by the Committee on Climate Change, oil and gas will continue to provide a fifth of that energy by mid-century. If so, it will then have to be fully offset, much of it by carbon capture and storage (a technology which anti-oil campaigners see as merely an excuse to keep drilling). Production from UK waters met 47% of gas demand last year, and 57% of oil demand (a net figure, because much oil goes overseas for refining, and Britain buys back refined product sourced from lots of places). At 1.2 million daily barrels of oil or its equivalent, that was the lowest output since 1977. It has fallen 28% since 2019, when output was flowing from big investments earlier last decade. OEUK expects annual decline averaging at least 8% per year from now. If investment doesn't keep flowing to tap into further reserves, that declining trend could be as high as 15% per year. Gas output is forecast to fall faster than oil, and at a much faster pace than gas central heating is being replaced. No great loss, you might say. Climate scientists tell us that we cannot sanction more production without busting through 1.5 degrees of warming. But if UK demand declines on current projections, much more imported energy will be required. The liquified gas comes with a much bigger carbon footprint, and as production declines globally, the remaining big exporters may have the rest of us over a barrel. It is not only that tax is weighing heavily on profitability, with Harbour Energy, now the biggest producer from UK waters, recently reporting an effective tax rate of 95%. It is also claimed that the windfall tax is being applied to profits that no longer reflect a windfall. The trade body shows that gas prices are getting close to their levels before Russia started sabre-rattling on the Ukrainian border. Flows have stepped up from Norway and shiploads of Liquified Natural Gas. Oil prices are down from the Ukraine war highs, but are trending at relatively high levels. Since the start of this year, the benchmark Brent crude price has risen from $76 to $87 per barrel. On the other side of the financial equation for oil companies, the cost of drilling the average barrel is up 50%, says OEUK. And without big new fields coming on stream, that unit cost will surely rise. It is claimed the rate of return on investment has dropped to 3% - lower than many other sectors. None of this is likely to win the sympathy of environment campaigners, who note the vast profits made by producers down the years and around the world. But among others, and particularly those contesting the Westminster election due in the next ten months, the industry wants to push back on simple slogans.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-68668648",1
"38","Rochdale by-election: Landslide win for George Galloway","By Jennifer McKiernan",2024-03-01,"George Galloway is back in Parliament with a resounding win in the Rochdale by-election after a campaign in which the Gaza war was a running theme. ""Keir Starmer - this is for Gaza,"" the former Labour MP said, after polling 12,335 votes, nearly 6,000 more than any other candidate. Mr Galloway will take his Commons seat for the Workers Party of Britain. Labour had withdrawn support for candidate Azhar Ali over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. Mr Ali apologised for his remarks. Mr Galloway has previously been an MP for Labour until 2003, then in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015. Smaller parties left the mainstream candidates in the dust in the Rochdale vote, which was sparked by the death of Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd, with second place going to independent and local businessman Dave Tully. In his victory speech, Mr Galloway highlighted the local voters' rejection of the two main parties in Westminster. He said: ""Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked tonight here in Rochdale."" He was interrupted by a heckler accusing him of being a climate change denier, before she was shouted down by his supporters, and had orange confetti thrown over him by rival candidate Rev Mark Coleman, a Just Stop Oil supporter. But none of this fazed the 69-year-old, who went on to warn that his former party would ""pay a high price"" for ""enabling, encouraging and covering for the catastrophe"" in Gaza. Mr Galloway has long agitated for causes related to the Middle East, including for Palestinian rights, and has regularly stood for election in constituencies with a high Muslim population, such as Rochdale. He told the BBC he had 60 Workers Party colleagues willing to stand in the general election and there would be ""a shifting of the tectonic plates in scores of parliamentary constituencies"". ""It's true that every Muslim is bitterly angry at Keir Starmer and his misnamed Labour party - but you would be very foolish if you didn't realise that millions of other citizens of our country are too,"" he said. ""Beginning here in the north west, in the west Midlands, in London, from Ilford to Bethnal Green and Bow, Labour is on notice that they have lost the confidence of millions of their voters who loyally and traditionally voted for them, generation after generation."" As well as pledging to save the town's football club from ""extinction"", Mr Galloway hailed the ""remarkable achievement"" of Mr Tully in coming second in the poll as an independent candidate campaigning on local issues. Mr Tully, who got 6,638 votes, is well-known in Rochdale as he runs a garage business and is involved with the town's rugby club. Despite never being involved in politics before, he said he stood in the by-election because he wanted ""to be the voice of Rochdale"". ""I feel I've turned the heads of people who don't usually vote because nothing ever really changes with mainstream politics and parties,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. The Conservative candidate Paul Ellison came in third place with 3,731 votes, the suspended Labour candidate Azhar Ali in fourth with 2,402, and Iain Donaldson came fifth for the Liberal Democrats with 2,164. The Reform Party had hopes this by-election could be a breakthrough for them as they fielded Simon Danczuk, the former Labour MP for Rochdale, but he was beaten into sixth place with 1,968 votes. Mr Galloway's party was only formed in 2019 and because it therefore did not field a candidate in Rochdale in the general election, Mr Galloway recorded a historic 41% swing against Labour in the vote. He also told the BBC afterwards that he had achieved political history in another way, matching Winston Churchill as the only MP to represent four separate towns and cities in the House of Commons. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Galloway only won because Labour withdrew support from its own candidate. He apologised to voters for this but said it was ""the right decision"". ""Obviously we will put a first-class candidate and a unifier before the voters in Rochdale at the general election,"" he added. Former Rochdale Labour council leader Alan Brett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not think Mr Galloway would have won if the Labour Party's selection process had not been mishandled. He added: ""I don't think he's for Rochdale - I think he's for himself - I don't think he cares about Rochdale."" The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) said it was ""extremely concerned"" by Mr Galloway's victory, accusing him of having an ""atrocious record of baiting the Jewish community"", including calling for Bradford, when he was an MP there, to be declared an ""Israel-free zone"". His victory comes amid concerns the war in the Middle East is inflaming community tensions in the UK, fuelling a rise in hate crimes and leading to MPs reporting that threats have been made personally against them. Veteran political pollster Sir John Curtice told the BBC the Rochdale result will intensify pressure on Sir Keir Starmer to toughen up Labour's stance on Israel. However he doubted there would be much impact on the general election result, because it is ""unlikely that anybody else has the ability to... exploit this issue [the war in Gaza] in the way that Mr Galloway is uniquely able to"".

Deborah Wilde, 69, Simon Milner-Edwards, 67, and William Ward, 66, were found guilty of aggravated trespass at City of London Magistrates' Court on Monday. The trio scaled a barrier and threw the items on the court during the third day of The Championships tournament in July. All three admitted entering the court but denied it amounted to the charge of aggravated trespass. After the verdict was delivered, deputy district judge Steven Jonas said: ""Firstly I want to thank all of the defendants for the way they've conducted themselves this evening, all of you will have been very stressed. He said it was ""not in dispute"" that each defendant ""sprinkled some confetti or tinsel and some jigsaw pieces on to that playing field"" and said he ""found it a fact"" that they were trespassing. He accepted that the three protesters waited for a break in play, but added: ""Nevertheless, I find as a fact that each of them intended to cause disruption to the tennis and as a result, they did cause some disruption on that day."" The three defendants, all of whom were self-represented, were told they could not use the threat of climate change as a defence. The court was told Wilde and Milner-Edwards entered Court 18 at around 14:10 BST on 5 July last year, during the Grand Slam match between Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov and Japan's Sho Shimabukuro. Bodycam footage played to the court showed them wearing Just Stop Oil T-shirts. Giving evidence in the trial, Michelle Dite, operations director at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), which runs the competition, said Wilde and Milner-Edwards threw ""around 1,000"" puzzle pieces from a jigsaw that had been purchased at the Wimbledon grounds, as well as confetti. When she arrived, the scene looked ""very unsettling"" and the players appeared ""very frustrated, probably quite intimidated"", she said. She added: ""There (was) glitter, flutter-fetti - orange - and jigsaw puzzle pieces that have been spread around different parts of the court; either side of the net."" Wimbledon staff cleared the jigsaw pieces and confetti by hand and using leaf blowers, she added. The pair were arrested at 14:16 BST. Around two hours later, Ward, also captured on bodycam footage wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt, went onto the same court. By that time, British player Katie Boulter had started competing against Australia's Daria Saville. Ms Dite claimed Ward's protest was met with louder ""boos"" from the crowd, many of whom had already witnessed the first incident. That year AELTC spent ""hundreds of thousands of pounds"" to manage potential protests after Just Stop Oil demonstrated at the World Snooker Championships and Ashes Test at Lord's Cricket Ground, she said. Court 18 is a show court, where many top seeds play in front of ""a few hundred"" people and there is extensive video coverage, Ms Dite added. Wilde and Ward were each given a six-month conditional discharge, while Milner-Edwards received an 18-month conditional discharge.","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn3n3x8gx2po",1
"40","Lee Anderson wrong to conflate Muslims with extremism, No 10 says","By Becky Morton",2024-02-27,"The prime minister believed Lee Anderson's comments about Sadiq Khan were unacceptable because they conflated ""all Muslims with Islamist extremism"", Downing Street has said. The former Tory deputy chairman was suspended from the party after refusing to apologise for saying ""Islamists"" had ""got control"" of the London mayor. The PM's official spokesman said the language he used was ""wrong"". But he added that Rishi Sunak did not believe Mr Anderson was racist. ""It's unacceptable obviously to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism or the extreme ideology of Islamism,"" he said. ""That's why the PM regarded those comments as wrong and unacceptable."" During a discussion on GB News on Friday, Mr Anderson said: ""I don't actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London, and they've got control of Starmer as well."" The MP for Ashfield was suspended from the parliamentary party on Saturday after refusing to apologise, and now sits as an independent. Speaking to BBC East Midlands Today, Mr Anderson said he stuck by the ""sentiment"" of his words but that he ""should have clarified his comments about the London mayor"". He said he was angry about weekly protests ""causing mayhem"" in the capital city but that he should have ""broadened out"" his criticism to include how demonstrations by groups such as Black Lives Matter, Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion were policed. On Monday, Mr Sunak said Mr Anderson was suspended because his comments were ""wrong"" and not acceptable. However, he has avoided calling them Islamophobic, prompting Labour to accuse the PM of being too ""weak"" to do so. Home Secretary James Cleverly joined calls for Mr Anderson to apologise on Monday, saying his comments were not ""accurate"" or ""fair"". However, Mr Anderson has also received support from some Conservative MPs, including Jacob Rees-Mogg. The former minister said his comments were ""infelicitous"" but ""his concerns about Islamism are entirely legitimate"" and he should not have been suspended from the party. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman is also said to think his suspension is an overreaction. Mr Anderson has acknowledged his words ""may have been clumsy"" but said apologising ""would be a sign of weakness"" as he believes he is right. In an interview on Monday with GB News - who employ him as a broadcaster - he argued pro-Palestinian protests outside Parliament and threats to MPs showed Mr Khan had ""lost control of the city"". Pressed over whether he would join the right-wing Reform UK party, the former Labour councillor declined to comment but said he had ""been on a political journey"". Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Scully has apologised for suggesting parts of London and Birmingham are ""no-go areas"". Speaking to BBC Radio London on Monday he had called Mr Anderson's comments ""inflammatory"" and urged him to apologise. However, the former minister also said he could see what he was ""trying to drive at"", going on to say parts of Tower Hamlets in London and Sparkhill in Birmingham were ""no-go areas"". His remarks were criticised by figures including the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who called them ""nonsense slurs"". In another interview with the station on Tuesday Mr Scully said he ""put his hands up"" for using language he ""regrets"". ""What I was trying to say, I thought I was being specific about but clearly not, is the fact that a lot of the conversation, and the vacuum that's allowed to then be filled by populists, is when prejudice builds up because of perception,"" he said. ""There are areas of this country where there are tiny, tiny groups of people that cause people to feel uncomfortable in particular areas. ""That might be a white gang, that might be a black gang, a Muslim gang, whatever, and that then tends to write off whole communities for some people."" The Sutton and Cheam MP described this line of thinking as ""totally inappropriate"".","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68415792",1
"41","Newspaper headlines: Starmer 'attacks Trump' and 'No way back for Harry'","By BBC News",2024-02-18,"The death of the Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny, continues to make Sunday's headlines. The Sunday Times says Russian intelligence officers are reported to have visited his prison two days before he died there. Human rights campaigners claim the FSB disconnected and dismantled security cameras and listening devices. The Sunday Telegraph suggests Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, could step into her husband's shoes as the Kremlin's chief foe. The paper says her ""years of strength and unwavering commitment to the cause of freedom in Russia"" mean she is ready. ""Don't let Navalny's death be in vain"", is the message from the editorial in the Sun on Sunday. The paper says what happened to him ""must unite the West like never before against Vladimir Putin's murderous tyranny"". The Observer is equally emphatic. ""Putin must be shown he can't kill with impunity,"" reads the headline of its editorial. The paper calls for the West to break off diplomatic relations with Moscow. ""Expel its lying, scheming diplomats"" it says, and ""send them all packing"". The Sunday Telegraph leads on what it calls a ""broadside"" from the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, towards Donald Trump after the US presidential hopeful's criticisms of Nato. Mr Trump has said the United States will ""not protect"" alliance members that fail to meet defence spending targets. According to the Telegraph, Sir Keir has insisted that, if he is elected Prime Minister, Britain will always stand up for its allies ""even if others threaten not to"". The Sunday Mirror reports that the government might call the general election in May. One former Conservative minister is quoted as saying a poll then would avoid challenges to Rishi Sunak's leadership and a damaging race to replace him. The Sunday Times, though, says the election is still expected in October or November. The paper also reports there are predictions that up to 150 Tories could announce they are quitting as MPs if polls continue to suggest Labour is on course for a landslide. The Mail on Sunday says it's discovered that activists from environmentalist group Just Stop Oil are planning a ""sinister nationwide blitz"" to occupy MPs' homes ahead of the general election. The paper says protestors told its undercover reporter they were ready to look a ""bit loony"" to get attention for their cause. A Just Stop Oil spokesman is quoted accusing paper of getting ""in a tizz"" about ""ordinary people taking the power back"". And finally, the Observer says the mainstay of casual conversation, the unexpected state of the weather, is under existential threat. The paper reports that scientists are beginning research to determine weather patterns a month into the future. While one of the experts from Reading University has stressed it will not be possible to predict if a particular day will be rainy or sunny, the researchers hope to be able to say if we are likely to experience a very wet or windy period four weeks in advance.

"42","Photographer arrested at Just Stop Oil protest gets payout","By Bob Dale & Ted Hennessey",2024-02-15,"A photographer arrested during a Just Stop Oil petrol station protest on the M25 has received a payout from Surrey Police. Peter Macdiarmid, 59, said he was handcuffed at Clacket Lane Services on 24 August 2022 and detained for several hours, despite holding a UK press card. He had been photographing activists blocking access to the petrol station by sitting in the road with banners. Surrey Police confirmed it had reached a settlement with Mr Macdiarmid. After Mr Macdiarmid was arrested, law firm Bhatt Murphy sent a letter of claim to Surrey Police on his behalf and last December the force offered to settle out of court. The force has not accepted liability or apologised for its actions, the British Press Photographers' Association (BPPA) said. Surrey Police's lawyers allegedly denied the officers did anything wrong, saying the situation they found when they arrived was confusing and they had acted within the law. Some Just Stop Oil protesters put fuel pumps out of use by breaking the display glass and covering them with spray paint. Mr Macdiarmid said: ""I have been a news photographer for 37 years and have covered many events where tensions were running high and police were under great pressure. ""This Just Stop Oil protest was not like that, it was very calm and protesters were voluntarily giving themselves up for arrest when a police officer decided to detain me on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. ""I was unable to persuade the arresting officer that I was a genuine working press photographer and my press card was ignored."" The BPPA said: ""In the end Peter has received damages and his costs, but would rather have not had to go through a lengthy and stressful legal process to clear his name."" Surrey Police confirmed it had reached a settlement with the claimant which was accepted.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-68305671",1
"43","Rochdale by-election: Candidates list",NA,2024-02-12,"A by-election prompted by the death of MP Tony Lloyd will be held in Rochdale on 29 February. Sir Tony died on 17 January, days after announcing he had an incurable form of leukaemia. Eleven people have put themselves forward to be the town's next MP. The late MP secured a majority of more than 9,000 in the 2019 general election. The deadline to register to vote in the by-election is midnight on 13 February. A change in the law last year means people who want to vote in person will have to remember to bring a form of photo ID with them. Candidates are listed in alphabetical order by surname. Azhar Ali is the Labour leader on Lancashire County Council and was chosen from a shortlist of three. However, on 12 February Labour said it had ""withdrawn support"" for him after comments he made regarding Israel. It was too late for the party to replace Mr Ali as its candidate. The decision means that Mr Ali will remain on the ballot as the Labour candidate for Rochdale, but if he is elected he will sit as a independent MP or join another party. Mr Ali, from Brierfield in Lancashire, has been a councillor in Nelson East since 2013. He joined Pendle Council aged 24 and served a five-year stint as a government advisor under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. At his campaign launch event, he said: ""In Rochdale there's a lot to do that Tony (Lloyd) started. ""I've set out my five pledges around reopening the maternity unit, investment in the town centre, and free breakfast clubs in the primary schools, and there is a long list of things that we need to do. ""And there's a real opportunity to send Rishi Sunak a clear message that Rochdale supports Labour and they want a general election to remove this government."" Mark Coleman is a long-time climate campaigner and Just Stop Oil supporter who was imprisoned for taking nonviolent direct action. The 64-year-old worked as a vicar in Rochdale town centre until he retired in 2020 due to Parkinson's disease. Mr Coleman said: ""The people of Rochdale deserve the truth - and that is we need radical action on climate right now to stand any chance of a safe and stable future. Government policies have put us well on the way to climate hell, and the Labour Party is willing to let that happen. ""I want the people of Rochdale to be able to 'vote change' in this election to show they want failing Westminster politicians to step up and defend our future."" A former Rochdale MP is standing in the by-election for Reform UK, the party founded by ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Simon Danczuk was elected as the Labour MP in 2010, but was suspended from the party in 2015 over allegations of what he called ""inappropriate behaviour"". He left the Labour Party in 2017 and stood as an independent in that year's general election, receiving 1.8% of the vote. He said: ""The reason I'm standing is because Rochdale's being let down by the main political parties. You've got the Conservatives nationally who are failing to grow the economy, and that impacts adversely on our town. And then secondly they're failing in terms of illegal immigration. It's just out of control and that again impacts on our town. Then locally you've got a lazy Labour Party running the council who are not delivering."" The Lib Dem Parliamentary candidate Iain Donaldson has promised to hold the Conservative government to account for ""failings on the NHS, the cost of living crisis, and water companies polluting the rivers with filthy sewage"". He said: ""The people of Rochdale have been hammered by the double whammy of a cost-of-living crisis and an NHS on its knees. This disastrous Conservative government has utterly failed our area and they need to be held to account. ""Locally, Labour have also taken people for granted because they just don't listen. It is vital that the people of Rochdale are represented with a voice that will take our community's issues right to the heart of Parliament and force ministers to address their concerns."" Paul Ellison, the Conservative candidate in the by-election, was voted Rochdale Man of the Year in 2020 after he helped the borough gain national recognition in the Royal Horticultural Society In Bloom awards. Mr Ellison, who runs a landscaping firm, said: ""In places like Rochdale, people's aspiration can often be stifled by the impacts brought about by negative perceptions. If elected, I am determined to be a champion to the borough. ""I believe there is a great opportunity to show the difference a local candidate with Conservative values of working together, taking pride in your community, and facilitating growth can do, bucking the expectation of a so-called Labour safe seat. ""Labour can't say what they'd do, because they don't have a plan, which means nothing will get better - taking us back to square one."" Former Labour and Respect Party MP George Galloway said he was running to ""teach Labour a lesson"". His Workers Party of Britain says it has a 10-point programme aimed at ""building a new working class politics in Britain"". It ""defends the achievements of the USSR, China, Cuba etc, not least the debt owed by humanity to the Soviet Union and Red Army in their war of liberation against German fascism"". Mr Galloway has contested by-elections in Greater Manchester before. He stood in the Gorton constituency in 2017 and won 5% of the vote. He said the main focus of his campaign will be calling for a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, adding: ""The number of people in Rochdale vitally concerned with the issues that preoccupy me... there's probably not a constituency in the whole country where there are more people concerned about Gaza than there are in Rochdale. ""[No] more people concerned about Kashmir than there are in Rochdale. So, as I have been a spokesman for these causes for more than half a century in both cases, it's obvious that I would be a candidate here."" Updated 10 February 2024 to expand upon the party's priorities Michael Howarth is a ""Rochdale born and bred"" businessman who owns a number of bars in the borough and works and lives in the town. He said he believed previous Rochdale MPs put their party before the town, and said ""smartening up the town centre"" would be one of his priorities. He said: ""Get the empty shops filled and the outlying areas, Millstone Road and the like. We've got to get businesses into town so my agenda would be to make an easier path to open a new business. Whether it be a shop, whether it be a printers, whatever it may be. Let's get businesses open quickly. The more businesses in town, the more jobs. The more jobs, the more prosperity. We can make Rochdale a great place to be."" Independent candidate Billy Howarth is a local campaigner who co-founded the support group Parents Against Grooming UK. He has recently campaigned for better housing for people affected by damp and mould. He raised the £500 candidate registration fee from GoFundMe donations. On the GoFundMe page, he said: ""After 30 years of child abuse cover-ups, two tired leaderships accompanied by failures to protect the town's constituents, I have decided that this town needs to be independently represented. ""I am Rochdale born and bred and have the needs of Rochdale close to my heart. I truly believe I can make the changes that this town wants and deserves."" Guy Otten's name will appear on the ballot paper, but soon after the campaign began the Green Party said he would be stepping down over previously criticising Palestinians and the Islamic religion. A Green Party spokesperson said: ""The Rochdale Green Party candidate has said that he has 'decided to leave the stage' following social media posts made some years ago. As nominations have now closed, his name will still appear on the ballot. However, he will not take part in any campaigning between now and polling day. ""We do not comment on disciplinary matters regarding Green Party members. These are internal matters. However, we are clear, we condemn all forms of racism and discrimination and do not accept it from any Green Party representative or spokesperson."" The candidate for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, Ravin Rodent Subortna, said that as MP he would campaign for the introduction of a 99p coin. He said he would call for all roundabouts to have fairground carousels in the middle to tell cars where to go and prevent road rage. Among his other policies is a plan for all new-build housing to have hedgehog homes included to help eradicate homelessness for hedgehogs, and making sure hedgehogs had lollipop signs to help them cross the road. Ravin says he is aiming to win ""zero votes"" because ""that would be fair to give everybody else a chance"". Local businessman Dave Tully said he was standing in the election to ""be a voice for the people of Rochdale across every community that wants to do good"". He said he was calling for the reinstatement of Rochdale's maternity ward, wanted more financial support for local businesses and would champion the community benefits of local amateur sports clubs including the rugby league club Rochdale Mayfield, where he is a committee member. He added: ""As an independent with no allegiance to any of the parties or any political views or opinions, I just want to do the best for my town and my community. That's basically what I want to achieve. That's what I'm going to advocate."" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

"44","Just Stop Oil eco-zealots writing Labour energy policy - Sunak","By Alice Thompson & Chris Mason",2023-06-07,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said ""eco-zealots"" from Just Stop Oil are ""writing Keir Starmer's energy policy"". Labour has pledged to ban new licences for oil and gas production in the UK. Some unions have warned this risks creating a ""cliff-edge"" for jobs. Dale Vince, a major donor to campaign group Just Stop Oil, has also given Labour more than £1.4m. Labour dismissed the idea Just Stop Oil influence policy, saying Sir Keir has condemned its protests. Mr Vince's green energy firm Ecotricity, has donated more than £1.4m to Labour since 2014, according to filings to the Electoral Commission. He has also donated to the Green Party as well as given money to environmental campaign group Just Stop Oil. There is no suggestion Just Stop Oil have funded Labour directly. But Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands has called for Labour to return donations, arguing it legitimises Just Stop Oil's tactics. Speaking to reporters in Washington DC, where he is due to meet President Biden, Mr Sunak said ""it does appear that these kind of eco-zealots at Just Stop Oil are writing Keir Starmer's energy policy"". The prime minister said: ""Not content with disrupting our summer and cherished sporting events, they are essentially leading us into an energy surrender. ""My view is we should focus on energy security, not weakness and dependency which seems to be the Labour Party's policy. ""They are putting ideology ahead of jobs, ahead of investment, and ahead of our energy security. I think that is wrong. ""It is a completely bizarre policy which says, 'we won't ban oil and gas; we will just ban British oil and gas'. ""The only people that benefit from Keir Starmer's energy policy are dictators and autocrats like Vladimir Putin."" Labour said that Sir Keir had been ""outspoken in his condemnation"" of Just Stop Oil, ""who he believes have put lives and livelihoods at risk"". ""The idea that they have influenced our policy is for the birds,"" a Labour spokesperson said. ""The modern Labour Party doesn't bow to fringe lobbies or extremists.

"45","Protests: Police powers to stop new tactics come into effect","By Oliver Slow",2023-07-02,"New measures aimed at curbing protest methods often used by environmental groups have come into effect. Police in England and Wales now have powers to move protesters who disrupt transport, while offenders could face three years in jail for tunnelling. The Home Office says the Public Order Act 2023 will target ""a selfish minority"" but critics argue they threaten the right to protest. Groups such as Just Stop Oil have continued with high-profile protests. Under the new laws, those found guilty of tunnelling or ""being present in a tunnel to cause serious disruption"" could be jailed for up to three years. Taking equipment to a tunnel carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison, as will obstructing major transport works. The digging of makeshift tunnels has been used for many years as a form of protest, against projects such as the building of the HS2 rail project, as well as by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil. The British Transport Police and the Ministry of Defence Police will now have powers to move static protests, a common tactic of campaign groups. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the heightened measures will target ""selfish protesters"" who cause ""mayhem"" on the streets. In recent months, the government has also introduced new powers to tackle tactics used by protest groups, including slow-walking and ""locking on"". Despite the enhanced measures, environmental groups have continued to take action, including briefly halting Saturday's annual Pride parade in central London in a protest against one of the event's sponsors. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson told the BBC the ""draconian"" measures were targeting young people who ""just want a liveable future"". Extinction Rebellion urged the government to stop curtailing the right to protest and instead ""stop issuing new licences for oil, coal and gas"".","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66079436",1

Ben Newman, 32, from Hackney, east London, pleaded guilty before Guildford Crown Court in Surrey. He was one of 31 people arrested on 3 June, including 12 on the racecourse grounds. Newman was sentenced to 18 weeks imprisonment suspended for two years and fined a total of £1,356. The Animal Rising activist was chased by police as the crowd jeered before officers tackled him and pulled him away a minute before the horses passed. Newman was criticised by Judge Mark Ockelton for risking the safety of police and security guards who dragged him to one side. Prosecutor Wendy Cottee described the incident as an ""orchestrated and organised action"" and read a text sent by the Animal Rising group to supporters prior to the race which stated: ""We need as many people as possible to go on to the tracks. ""The more of us there are, the more disruption we can cause."" The protest happened after the Jockey Club, which owns Epsom Downs, was granted an injunction banning the Animal Rising group from intervening in the event. Judge Ockelton said: ""The reality of what he did is that a number of public servants had to deal with him with a crowd of horses running towards them. ""This endangered a huge number of public servants."" On Wednesday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman held a summit at Downing Street with police and sports bodies, including the Lawn Tennis Association, the Premier League and the England and Wales Cricket Board to discuss plans to step up security at summer sporting events.

"47","Met 'underfunded for London's unique demands'","By James W Kelly",2023-12-10,"The Metropolitan Police lacks the funding it needs to meet London's “unique demands”, Sadiq Khan has said. The mayor has written to Home Secretary James Cleverley to call for an increase in the National and International Capital City (NICC) grant. NICC is a mechanism provided to the Met to support the additional costs of policing a capital city – including protests, sporting events and diplomatic protection. The Home Office said the force will receive up to £102.3m more in 2023/24 than the previous year. In his letter, Mr Khan wrote: “The Home Office’s independent expert review in 2015 identified a £159m annual gap in funding (at 2015 prices) and recent estimates from the [Metropolitan Police Service] suggest it could now be £240m.” The mayor highlighted the policing of protests and vigils connected to the Israel-Gaza war since October as a strain on police resources. He said 28,000 shifts have been completed in connection with the events. “These additional costs result in reduced resource available for frontline and neighbourhood teams,” he said. Officer welfare is also taking a hit, the mayor wrote, with 4,000 rest days being cancelled. “Many officers have worked every weekend since 7 October and sickness rates are rising, a trend which is likely to continue,” he added. Mr Khan singled out Just Stop Oil protests as a particular repeated issue for police. Figures released by the Met this week show 657 arrests were made over the last five weeks at the climate protests, at a cost of £3.5m. A Met spokesperson said it also resulted in “10,500 officer shifts being taken away from communities”. “The return of a fully funded NICC would not only benefit our officers but all those who live, work or visit London,” Mr Khan said. Susan Hall, Conservative assembly member at City Hall and party candidate for mayor of London, said it is ""vital"" the force has the resources it needs. ""Sadiq Khan has been given millions by the government to get more boots on the ground,"" she added. ""He failed to hit that target and had to give much of that cash back."" A spokesperson for the Home Office said it was ""giving the police the resources they need to tackle crime"". “The Metropolitan Police will receive up to £3.3bn in 2023/24, an increase of up to £102.3m on the previous year,"" they said. ""This includes £185.3m in recognition of the increased demands the force faces from policing the capital city. “We have also provided an additional £75.3m of in-year funding to support the force in managing the costs associated with the 2023/24 pay award.”","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2zj89nvzlo",1

A coach carrying the migrants arrived at the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, shortly before 13:00 BST. The vessel, which has capacity for up to 500 men awaiting the outcome of asylum applications, was evacuated in August after Legionella bacteria was found in the water supply. The Home Office said it was now ""safe and secure"". The government has said ""using vessels as alternative accommodation, like our European neighbours are already doing, will be better value for British taxpayers and more manageable for communities than costly hotels"". About 30 protesters gathered at the port gates holding banners saying: ""Scrap the prison barge! Refugees welcome."" Just Stop Oil activists managed to stop the coach carrying the asylum seekers in what they called a ""positive protest"" in support of the campaign against the use of the barge. Dorset Police said two people were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage to the coach when it was stopped in Portland Beach Road, while a third person was held on suspicion of criminal damage to a police vehicle. Candy Udwin, of Stand Up To Racism Dorset, said she had been in contact with some of those who had been staying on the Bibby Stockholm. She said: ""They hate it, they say it feels like a prison, some hate being on the sea, they find it very difficult to leave and they are completely separated from the community."" Less than a week after the men first went on the facility, all 39 were disembarked as a precaution when traces of Legionella bacteria, which can cause Legionnaires disease - a type of pneumonia, were found. They were then moved to a hotel. A letter, seen by the BBC, was sent to asylum seekers confirming their re-embarkation and reiterated all asylum accommodation continued to be offered on a ""no-choice basis"". An asylum seeker, who asked to remain anonymous, spoke to the BBC ahead of his return to the vessel. He said it had been a ""difficult"" process as he has not seen his family for nine months, but being in a hotel he had felt ""free"". ""It feels scary,"" he said, adding: ""[The barge] will be crowded. If there's a single virus, then you know everyone will be affected. I think it will be very bad for all of us."" He added: ""I lived there for five days and have experience on the barge, and that's why I am not happy to go back. ""In the hotel we are free to come and go at any time, we are free and [on the barge] we are bound to something - it's like a prison. It is difficult for all of us and many have said they don't want to go back."" The move comes after local councillor Carralyn Parkes lost a High Court fight with Home Secretary Suella Braverman over the lawfulness of housing asylum seekers on the ship. Mr Justice Holgate ruled in the government's favour, saying Mrs Parkes did not have an arguable case. She has since issued a further judicial review claim in the High Court challenging the ongoing decision by Dorset Council that it has no planning jurisdiction over the Bibby Stockholm in Portland Harbour. By Dan Johnson West & south-west of England correspondent The Bibby Stockholm was intended to show there's no luxury in the UK's asylum process, that Britain isn't the soft touch some think. But instead the accommodation barge - repeatedly delayed and beset by problems - became a floating illustration of how complicated our migration challenge is. It was announced in April, was late arriving from Italy, then delayed for refit and inspections in Cornwall, and finally reached Portland in July. When journalists were shown on board we saw a clean and functional vessel with bedrooms down narrow corridors, typical of the industrial accommodation it previously offered to offshore oil workers. Bunk beds were the obvious sign of the doubled capacity which concerned many opponents of the plan, and fire safety experts. What we couldn't see was the Legionella bacteria lurking in the water system. That meant the government's August ""small boats week"" started with the first 39 asylum seekers stepping aboard, then ended with them evacuated back to hotels, after just five nights - embarrassing given the Home Office's intention to reduce hotel bills. There will be a hope everything has now been double, if not triple, checked to avoid any further delays. But even if the Bibby Stockholm reaches its capacity of 500 men, that's only a tiny fraction of the 175,000 currently backlogged in the asylum system. The barge is expected to draw further protests, having already proved controversial on Portland and beyond. Some people question - with the extra costs of chartering, mooring, transport and security - how a vessel can be cheaper than a hotel. The risk is that conditions on board still look too harsh for those concerned about asylum seekers' rights, but not tough enough for those who want a harder line against immigration and small boat crossings. The solutions to ""stop the small boats"" are difficult and contentious. The Bibby Stockholm was planned to be the first of a fleet of barges moored around the coast. So far, it stands alone. The local authority has not mounted a legal challenge to the barge, stating that it would be costly and have little chance of success. The vessel is part of the government's policy to reduce the costs of placing migrants in hotels. The Home Office said: ""Delivering accommodation sites such as the Bibby Stockholm will be more affordable for taxpayers, helping to reduce the £8m daily cost of hotels as well as being more manageable for local communities. ""We're confident that the project, which will house asylum seekers in safe and secure accommodation, meets the planning requirements."" The 222-room, three-storey barge, chartered by the government for 18 months, arrived at the port in July. It was previously used to accommodate homeless people and asylum seekers in Germany and the Netherlands.

The motor sports event in Northamptonshire runs until Sunday. It features races, classic Formula 1 cars, a celebration of stock car racing, and music from chart acts. Silverstone's managing director Stuart Pringle said it was ""not a stuck-in-aspic historic festival - it's a festival that grows year on year"". Previously known as the Silverstone Classic, the event has had a name change. ""The reality is that the content that is on the track is exactly the same as it was - the classic, top-quality historic racing,"" he said. ""But actually, we've put a lot more emphasis on the music element, as we did with Formula 1, and we've got more entertainment for the whole family. ""The days of groups of men going off to watch motor racing is behind us, and actually we've got to appeal to whole family groups."" The event features three days of racing and classic car parades, while the music stages include McFly, ABC, The Christians and Sugababes. Mr Pringle is also responsible for ensuring the British Grand Prix goes off smoothly each year. Speaking about the fact there was no repeat of the 2022 track invasion at this year's British Grand Prix, he said: ""I was very pleased."" Mr Pringle said a large team of people were involved in planning how to prevent and respond to any protest, such as that carried out by Just Stop Oil. He said the festival was less pressure for him than F1 and it was equally enjoyable, adding that the circuit's reputation acted as a magnet for the very best cars. ""I'm a real sucker for pre-war cars, but putting me on the spot, I'd go for the late 50s early 60s cars,"" he said. ""They're have a combination of the beautiful sculpted look, before aero-dynamics really became the driving force."" He said the public would have a chance to get up close to the vehicles and talk to the drivers. ""If you are into your cars this is the place to come,"" he said.

"54","Keir Starmer speech disrupted as protester glitter-bombs Labour leader","By Joshua Nevett",2023-10-10,"A man has been arrested after a protester gatecrashed Sir Keir Starmer's speech and showered the Labour leader with glitter at the party's conference. The speech was delayed as the protester was dragged off stage by security and the man was put in a police van. The protest was claimed by People Demand Democracy, which uses disruptive tactics to push for electoral reform. Sir Keir dusted off the glitter and said the protest did not bother him. ""Protest or power, that's why we've changed,"" Sir Keir said, before setting out his vision of a country governed by a Labour government. It was a chaotic start to his conference speech, potentially his last before the next general election. But a spokesman later said the Labour leader was ""fine"" and ""completely unfazed by what happened"". ""It shows his strength of character that he got on and delivered the speech of his life,"" the spokesman added. Nevertheless, the protest raises questions about the effectiveness of the security arrangements for Sir Keir, who has close protection as leader of the opposition. Wearing a T-shirt with People Demand Democracy emblazoned on the front, the protester said ""politics needs an update"" in front of a stunned audience in Liverpool. Minutes later, a man was filmed being escorted from the conference centre and put into a police van outside. Merseyside Police said a 28-year-old man from Surrey had been arrested on suspicion of assault, breach of the peace and causing public nuisance following an incident at Labour's conference. ""He has been taken to a police station where he will be questioned by police,"" a spokesperson said. The campaign behind the protest is linked to Just Stop Oil, which is well known for its disruptive demonstrations, such as spraying buildings with orange paint and sprinkling glitter at sporting events. People Demand Democracy says it is a new group calling for ""an upgrade to the UK political system using civil disobedience to get their message across"". The campaign is calling for ""a fair, proportional voting system for Westminster elections and a permanent, legally-binding national House of Citizens, selected by democratic lottery"". In a statement prepared before Sir Keir's speech, the protester backed the campaign's calls for democratic reform and said Labour had been ""captured"" by donors and lobbyists. In a letter to Sir Keir on its website, People Demand Democracy urged Labour to ""hold new national elections with a proportional voting system and set up a House of Citizens within six months of getting into office"". The campaign warned Sir Keir that if he did not meet their demands, ""People Demand Democracy will take proportionate action to get our message across to you and the Labour Party leadership"". When asked how the security breach was allowed to happen, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said ""you can't bother Keir Starmer with stuff like that"". She told the BBC ""it's about power not protest, that's what Keir Starmer was talking about"". ""He kept going and made this amazing speech."" Sir Keir received multiple standing ovations during his speech, as he promised a ""decade of national renewal"" under a Labour government, including a plan for 1.5 million new homes. The incident is reminiscent of demonstrations during other speeches by party leaders and prime ministers at previous conferences. For example last year, Greenpeace campaigners heckled Liz Truss during her conference speech, and in 2017, a comedian was able to walk straight up to the stage and hand Theresa May a mock P45.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67063732",1

Some papers describe Vladimir Putin as being a president who is humiliated and his leadership has been left dented and damaged. The Sun on Sunday says President Putin has been ""pushed to the brink"" before the Wagner mercenaries halted their march towards Moscow as the paper puts it at the ""eleventh hour"". Russians will now see Putin is someone far weaker, according to the Sunday Express which claims the leader ""fled"" Moscow as mercenaries approached the capital. In the Sunday Telegraph British historian Robert Tombs believes while President Putin narrowly avoided a ""1917 moment"", he is ""gravely weakened"". But, writing in the paper he also has a warning for exiled Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin - adding ""mutineers tend to end up dead"". Prigozhin's last-minute de-escalation deal with President Putin prevented ""bloodshed"" on the streets of Russia, according to the front page of the Observer. While the paper makes a note of remarkable comments from the Mayor of Moscow who urged citizens to stay indoors. The Mail on Sunday asks whether the Kremlin ""bribed"" the leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to end the mutiny, as it cites UK security official sources. But, in the Sunday edition of the Daily Star the tabloid claims both sides are ""equally bonkers"". Elsewhere, the Sunday Times quotes a former donor to Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, who believes the groups are ""not accomplishing anything"".

"57","Eight things Suella Braverman said that made headlines","By Dominic Casciani",2023-11-13,"Suella Braverman has been sacked as home secretary - leaving one of the most important jobs in government for a second time in just over a year. She has been no stranger to controversy in her time in office. Mrs Braverman resigned from the same job while Liz Truss was prime minister before being brought back into government a week later by Rishi Sunak. Here are eight things she said that made headlines - and caused controversy. ""I would love to have a front page of the Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda, that's my dream, it's my obsession."" This was said at a fringe event at last year's Conservative Party conference, shortly after she had been appointed as home secretary by Liz Truss. She was referring to the government's asylum plan, to take asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel to the UK on a one-way ticket to Rwanda where they could claim asylum instead. Mrs Braverman faced criticism from refugee groups and others for trivialising the plight of people in need. The most important point about the quote is not whether you agree with its tone, but that the new home secretary was making clear her single priority would be controlling migration. ""Tofu-eating wokerati"" One of Suella Braverman's first tasks as home secretary was to pilot through Parliament a plan to restrict the right to protest in order to stop highly disruptive stunts by groups, including Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil - such as motorway occupations. She accused the opposition of being in league with eco-protesters because a previous version of the measures had failed to win enough support. ""I am afraid that it is the Labour Party, the Lib Dems, the coalition of chaos, the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati and, dare I say, the anti-growth coalition that we have to thank for the disruption we are seeing on our roads today."" ""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility: I resign"" The very next day Mrs Braverman sensationally quit as home secretary, after confessing to a serious blunder. She had sent a confidential and sensitive government email to her own Gmail account and then forwarded it to her confidante and Tory backbencher, John Hayes. However, the real story here was the timing. The incident had happened some time earlier - and her resignation came as Liz Truss was on the precipice and her government in turmoil. In her resignation letter, Mrs Braverman accused the embattled PM of breaking key pledges. The next day, Liz Truss resigned as prime minister. Less than a week later, Mrs Braverman's serious ministerial error was forgiven by the new prime minister, Rishi Sunak - and she was back in the same job. ""The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast."" There had been months of rising political tension over small boat crossings - and at the end of October 2022, a man firebombed the government's arrivals centre for the migrants in Dover's docks. Separately, independent inspectors warned conditions were ""wretched"" at a migrant reception camp. Mrs Braverman came out fighting in the Commons, but days later, she was confronted in her constituency by 83-year-old Holocaust survivor Joan Salter. ""When I hear you using words against refugees like 'swarms' and an 'invasion',"" she said, ""I am reminded of the language used to dehumanise and justify the murder of my family and millions of others."" ""There are 100 million people around the world who could qualify for protection under our current laws. Let us be clear - they are coming here."" For the second time in two years, the government launched a new immigration plan. Parliament eventually voted to place a legal duty on the home secretary to not only detain anyone crossing the English Channel, but also remove them to another country, such as Rwanda. In the Commons, Mrs Braverman stuck to her guns and made the 100 million claim. The next day, she doubled-down, telling the Daily Mail there was ""likely billions"" eager to come to the UK. She returned to analysing migrant trends at the Conservative Party conference, last month, declaring: ""The wind of change that carried my own parents across the globe in the 20th Century was a mere gust compared with the hurricane that is coming."" Experts have disputed her projections, saying the UK receives far fewer asylum seekers than other countries, and that recent record numbers of arrivals of workers and students will likely level off. ""Multiculturalism makes no demands of the incomer to integrate. It has failed."" The daughter of immigrants from Mauritius and Kenya, Mrs Braverman told an American think tank that migrants end up living ""parallel lives"" - a phrase first used 20 years ago in relation to complex riots in northern England. Opponents said she had given up fixing the UK's broken asylum system and was trying to set out her stall for the Tory leadership. ""We cannot allow our streets to be taken over by rows of tents occupied by people, many of them from abroad, living on the streets as a lifestyle choice."" That social media post came amid government backroom wrangling over what would make it into this year's King's Speech. Mrs Braverman reportedly wanted to impose fines on charities who give tents to rough sleepers. Her push to get the police included triggered an internal row with colleagues. The idea was not included in the speech. ""There's only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches."" Speaking after a government emergency meeting over the crisis in Gaza, Mrs Braverman laid into the pro-Palestinian demonstrators amid rows over whether their chants amounted to antisemitic attacks. And it's the row that has ultimately led to her downfall. On 8 November, the Times newspaper published a column by the Mrs Braverman where she repeated the phrase - and also accused the police of bias, saying they were ""playing favourites"" with some demonstrations and using stronger tactics against some and not others. This triggered accusations of political interference in independent policing - an absolute red line that ministers cannot cross under British laws. Her comments were condemned by former police officers, MPs and Labour, who accused her of ""deliberately creating division"". Four days later - and following clashes between protesters, counter-protesters and police in London on Armistice Day - she was sacked.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67374951",1
"58","Why Suella Braverman can't stop Palestinian protests","By Dominic Casciani",2023-11-09,"As things stand, there is going to be a potentially huge pro-Palestinian march in London, on Armistice Day - and there is nothing Home Secretary Suella Braverman alone can do to stop it. The reason for that is simple: the law does not tell the Met Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley to take into account the views of ministers. It tells him to assess the risks to the public - and make a plan accordingly. Since the Gaza conflict began, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has organised three national protests in London on successive Saturdays that have grown larger week-on-week. It has negotiated with the police over the route and duration of each and abided by conditions. The police have a delicate balancing act to perform in protecting free speech and assembly - and also protecting the rights of others not to be intimidated. The Met says where protesters have supported terrorist groups, broken racial-hatred laws, or committed other offences, they have made arrests. So far, more than 200 have been arrested - each serious in its own terms, including some allegations of support for Hamas - which is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. But put those numbers in the wider context of public order policing in London. On Monday alone, police arrested 219 Just Stop Oil demonstrators who tried to stop traffic near Parliament. The Extinction Rebellion ""sit-ins"" of more than two years ago saw officers cart away a staggering 4,118 demonstrators. Opponents of the PSC say marchers are chanting deeply antisemitic slogans and providing a cover for extremists. But while individuals can be arrested for hate crime offences, the legal test for banning an event is more complex. The Public Order Act 1986 gives Sir Mark Rowley and other police chiefs the power to apply conditions to marches where they reasonably believe there could be: The PSC has agreed to conditions under that law. Its supporters say they will gather an hour after the two-minute silence on Armistice Day and more than a mile away from the Cenotaph. Their march, ending with a rally at the US Embassy, is planned to go nowhere near the memorial. Rishi Sunak has described holding a march on Armistice Day as disrespectful and a risk to the Cenotaph or other memorials. But given the PSC has repeatedly abided by conditions imposed on its previous marches, the only conclusion the police can reach - unless they get intelligence to the contrary - is that a risk to the Cenotaph won't come from protesters on the march route. And that's why the force has concluded there is no legal justification to ask the home secretary to ban the march. That power can only be used if a police chief believes they cannot prevent ""serious public disorder"". That basically means violent crowds potentially bent on running amok. The police haven't seen that in previous weeks. So if police commanders asked the home secretary to ban the march, the organisers could go to court - and judges would need to see evidence and intelligence proving the serious risk. Do you plan to attend a protest? Get in touch. The last time these powers were used was in 2011 and 2012. The then-home secretary, on the recommendation of the Met, banned the far-right English Defence League (EDL) from marching through Muslim communities. The EDL was considered to be a thuggish mob and marchers would regularly chant racist or Islamophobic slogans. The Campaign Against Antisemitism says the ""River to the Sea"" chant, that will almost certainly be heard on Saturday's march, is deeply offensive and threatening - but the PSC event is not going through Jewish communities - and the Met says that its legal advice is that the slogan can be legitimate free speech in such circumstances. What would happen if the march were banned? The Met believes people would still come to London and stand in the street and peacefully have their say. The police cannot stop them. The last time they tried, it was a fiasco. In March 2021, the organisers of a vigil for murdered Londoner Sarah Everard cancelled the event. They feared they would individually face enormous fines under the then Covid lockdown rules, if they were seen to encourage the gathering. But there was such confusion over whether there was still a right to protest, regardless of the risk of transmitting the virus, that people turned out anyway. They felt so strongly about the horrific murder they wanted to be heard. The Met ended up paying compensation to women who were arrested. So the huge risk is that, even if Suella Braverman got her way, people would not only come out, but they would march independently. That would be twice as hard for police because there would be no organisers on the ground directing events and calling on people to abide by a route and curfew. And then there is the risk of counter-demonstrations. Former Met commander Dal Babu says Ms Braverman's attack on the forthcoming march has emboldened the extreme far right. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founder of the largely defunct English Defence League under the alias Tommy Robinson, is calling on followers to join him near the Cenotaph. Other less well known figures are doing the same. ""I've never known an occasion for the home secretary to get involved in operational policing at this level,"" says Mr Babu. ""She doesn't understand the law. She doesn't understand the legislation."" So is there anything the home secretary could do to force the Met to ban the march? If Ms Braverman is satisfied that the Met is ""failing to discharge any of its functions in an effective manner"" she can direct the Mayor of London to intervene. But that is a power designed to be used in exceptional circumstances. And she is not allowed to use that power until she has first consulted the inspectorate of police forces, the expert body on how chief constables are performing. Sir Tom Winsor, former HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Ms Braverman had ""crossed the line"". ""The operational independence of the police is not a debatable matter,"" he said. ""The policing protocol order made by this home secretary in June 2023... stresses the operational independence of the police. ""It is the will of Parliament and the government that the police shall not be open to improper political interference that the police must act with impartiality, including political impartiality.""

"59","Just Stop Oil Dartford bridge protester released from jail, says group","By Lewis Adams",2023-12-12,"A Just Stop Oil protester who scaled the Dartford Crossing bridge has been released from prison, the group has said. Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed in April for three years for causing a public nuisance. He has spent about 14 months in custody including time on remand. His co-defendant Marcus Decker, a German national, is still in prison and the environmental campaign group is campaigning against his deportation. Decker was jailed for two years and seven months for the same offence. Trowland said ""it's a beautiful day"" in a video posted on X after his release. The structural engineer, of Islington, north London, and his co-defendant Decker, of no fixed address, caused gridlock traffic on the M25 after the pair climbed the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge on 17 October last year and remained suspended on cables for about 37 hours. Trowland argued during the trial at Basildon Crown Court that it was a peaceful protest and that they tried to ""deliver a warning message"" over government oil and gas licences. The United Nations has criticised the length of the sentences. An online petition started by Decker's partner, which calls on the Home Office to stop his deportation, has about 145,000 signatures. A government spokesperson previously said: ""Foreign nationals who commit crimes here in the UK will face the full force of the law, including deportation."" The trial in April was told almost 565,000 drivers faced delays due to the protest. Essex Police claimed a heavily pregnant woman could not get urgent medical help due to the traffic, with another person having to miss a best friend's funeral.

"61","Climate anxiety: Why we won't be flying home for Christmas","By Riyah Collins",2023-12-23,"Whether it's driving, hopping on the train or catching a bus, there's a chance you'll be packing a bag and heading home for Christmas. For most of us, there isn't much that would keep us away from family over the festive period. But some people, like activists Aliza Ayaz and Sean Currie, have made the choice to put the environment above everything else. They won't be seeing their relatives this year after they decided to drastically limit or stop flying altogether. Aliza tells BBC Newsbeat thinking about flights brings ""the anxiety of 'Oh my God, I can't do it because of the carbon footprint'. ""But also, my parents could really use seeing me because I'm their eldest daughter."" Aliza was born in Dubai to Pakistani parents who now live in Saudi Arabia. She studies at University College London, where she set up its Climate Action Society, and is now a UN youth ambassador for sustainable development. The 25-year-old says her anxiety never goes away ""because the carbon footprint of one flight is so enormous, especially a long-haul flight"". According to the International Civil Aviation Organization's emissions calculator, a return flight from London to Riyadh generates about 620kg of CO2 per passenger. It's a similar story for Sean Currie. The 26-year-old left his family home in the Scottish Highlands and moved to Belgium for work in 2019. He's since decided to stop flying, and admits the journey over land and sea takes so long that he no longer visits very often. ""For three years I didn't see my half-sister or niece,"" he says. Sean says his other sister lives in the Philippines - an 18-hour flight away - and he's ""just come to terms with the fact that I will never visit her"". ""I don't think that I can justify to myself the impact that it has on the world,"" he says. Sean works with Stay Grounded, a group which campaigns for the aviation industry to be made smaller. He says his main activities are ""non-disruptive"", including lobbying and writing to politicians, but he has also been involved in direct protests. Sean recently joined a group of hundreds who blocked access to two airports in Europe. While these types of tactics are sometimes criticised when used by groups such as Just Stop Oil, Sean tells Newsbeat his more direct activities target private jets and not everyday travellers. But he says he doesn't condemn protests that might affect the lives of ordinary people. ""The disruption that will be caused by drought, floods and food shortages will be a whole lot more disruptive that somebody sitting in traffic,"" he says. Sean counts himself as lucky that, even if the journeys are long, trains and buses are an option for him. ""Train travel can be a wonderful thing,"" he says. ""But, to be honest, I don't enjoy buses."" Neither of those are realistic options for Aliza though. She can't totally rule out getting on a plane so made the decision to limit herself to one flight a year, taking an extended trip to make it as worthwhile as possible. While her parents have been supportive, she says ""you can see that they're upset in their eyes, and they would like to see more of me and I would like to see more of them"". She'll instead spend Christmas with her partner's family in Leeds, while Sean heads to his wife's family home in Italy on the train. Instead the pair will rely on technology to feel connected to their families. ""We'll get on a call together, we'll cook meals together or mum will watch us and then we'll talk about everything from our days,"" Aliza says. Sean and his family play online games together and he has a special routine with his sister in the Philippines, which is seven hours ahead of Belgium. ""My sister adapts her schedule so that when she calls us she's still in some type of Christmas mood,"" he says. ""She makes sure that she opens some presents when she's on the call, even if it means leaving them unopened most of the day."" But there are some things he misses back home, particularly a big Hogmanay party. ""There's a real kind of tradition around it in my village that I love to be part of,"" he says. Although they stand by their decisions not to fly this Christmas, sometimes Sean and Aliza grapple with the sacrifice. ""I do wonder how meaningful it is for me to cut down my flying, especially when there's so many factors that make you feel that it's unfair,"" Aliza says. ""There's people often doing short-haul trips, multiple holidays in a year, and I don't even get to see my family."" But Anna Hughes - the director of Flight Free UK, a charity which encourages people to pledge to not fly for a year - says it's important to know that individuals can make a difference. ""The majority of flights come from people flying from on holiday,"" she says. Anna believes if enough people choose alternative travel like trains or destinations closer to home, the industry will respond to that. She uses veganism as an example, saying: ""I've been vegan for about 10 years and when I started, people would just look at me funny and offer me a salad. ""Now they give me a menu. Things have changed, and they change quickly. ""We all have to remember that our individual action does say something.""

The force said the time it had spent on the group equated to roughly 300 officers being taken off frontline policing each day. It added JSO had ""refused to engage"" with police when planning protests. JSO said it would continue its actions until ""steps are taken to prevent the extraction of new oil and gas"". Hundreds of protests have been held since the group's first demonstration in 2022. As well as marching on roads, JSO activists have disrupted events including The Open golf, Wimbledon, the Ashes, the London Pride March and the Chelsea Flower Show. Cdr Kyle Gordon, the senior officer responsible for planning the Met's response to the latest round of JSO's protests, said: ""£20m from the public purse is a lot of money. I would much, much prefer to be using that within communities. ""These officers should be responding to local communities and dealing with local issues instead of being taken away to police Just Stop Oil protests."" He added: ""When [JSO] talk about slow marches, it is in everything other than name an attempt to block the road and cause maximum disruption to people right across London. ""Our desire is that Just Stop Oil come forward and speak with us, so we can actually work with them. ""We absolutely understand and support the fundamental right to protest within a democratic society, but what we've got to do is balance that right with the rights of everybody else who is using this city."" A spokesperson for JSO said the group had written to Sir Mark Rowley, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, about new oil and gas licensing in October but had had no response. ""The police must know that unless steps are taken to prevent the extraction of new oil and gas, they will be on the frontlines of dealing with social breakdown and mass civil unrest,"" the spokesperson added.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67639741",1

The Met said the cost of policing 515 protests carried out by JSO since April has amounted to the equivalent of 23,500 officer shifts. Over that time more than 270 people were arrested over the demonstrations, which included slow marches and the disruption of high-profile events. The force called the action ""crime"", but JSO said it would continue. During the three months of JSO protests, the Met issued 420 section 12 orders to clear the city's roads. Met Assistant Commissioner Twist said: ""This isn't protest, this is crime, and there is a difference. ""The right to protest is strongly protected, but when you get into deliberately causing serious disruption, that tips over into crime,"" he told LBC. As well as marching in main roads, activists have disrupted events including The Open, Wimbledon, the Ashes, the London Pride March and the Chelsea Flower Show. The cost to the Met is on top of the £7.5m spent by the force policing JSO protest action between October and December last year. A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: ""Matt Twist has laid out the consequences of the Policing Act for all to see: legitimate protest is now classed as crime.

"67","Just Stop Oil protester who delayed thousands convicted over M25 protest",NA,2024-02-19,"A Just Stop Oil protester has been convicted of causing a nuisance by climbing on to a gantry over the M25 in west London. Cressida Gethin, 22, scaled the gantry above the M25 near Heathrow Airport in July 2022 to protest the UK reaching its hottest temperature on record, 40C (104F), the day before. Those affected by delays included 4,000 airline customers, the court heard. She did not dispute scaling the gantry but denied it amounted to the charge. Speaking outside Isleworth Crown Court after the verdict, the Cambridge University music student said she did not regret the protest and would ""not back down"". As a result of the protest by the climate activist group, 3,923 British Airways customers were affected by cancellations and delays, said Edwin Hall, senior manager at British Airways, in a statement read to the court. Broadcaster and environmentalist Chris Packham told the court during the trial that he was stuck in the resulting traffic for four to five hours during a trip from Hampshire to Surrey, where he was working on a BBC programme. He told jurors he came to ""sympathise"" with the fact he was forced to think about climate change while he waited. Mr Packham later said outside the court: ""What makes a music student, aged 22, with her whole life ahead of her, do something as precarious, physically dangerous and now, potentially in terms of an impact on her life, dangerous? ""Well, I think I know the reason and I think everyone else knows the reason."" During her trial, Ms Gethin, who has taken two years out of her university studies, said she aimed to ""interrupt business as usual"" and draw media attention to the ""dire situation"" represented by the temperature in Britain. However, she said she did not realise she was so close to Heathrow Airport and did not choose the location. In her closing statement last week Gethin, who was self-represented, told the court: ""If you believed that the protest causing the delays was intended to create meaningful, positive change, would you have defined the delay as 'serious inconvenience'?"" However, Judge Hannah Duncan said ""evidence about climate change wasn't admissible or relevant"". On Friday, Judge Duncan said she believed the average person would consider the climate crisis ""far more serious"" than a nuisance, but ""that's not what they [the jury] are considering"". After the verdict, Gethin said that while pleading guilty would have given credit in her favour, she ""felt very strongly"" the need to tell the jury ""why I had done what I had done"". A jury found Gethin guilty of causing a public nuisance contrary to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, by a majority of 10 to two.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-68317295",1
"68","Rochdale: Is this the most chaotic by-election ever?","By Brian Wheeler",2024-02-24,"By-elections are often colourful and chaotic but there has never been anything quite like the contest taking place in Rochdale right now. The vote next Thursday - caused by the death of the town's widely respected Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd - should have been relatively straightforward for Sir Keir Starmer's party, riding high on the back of a string of by-election victories around the country. But the entry into the race of maverick former MP and left-wing firebrand George Galloway - and the spectacular implosion of Labour's campaign - has thrown the contest wide open. Mr Galloway is mainly targeting Rochdale's Muslim population, who make up about 30% of the electorate, many of whom are angry about what is happening in Gaza. ""The people of Gaza don't have a vote in this election, you do,"" reads one of his campaign leaflets. At a meeting at the town's Kashmir Youth Project, he says that, if elected, he will ""enter the chamber of the House of Commons like a tornado"" and ""shake the walls for Gaza"". He claims a victory for him in Rochdale, a small town near Manchester, will be noticed ""by the people in Gaza, by the people in Tel Aviv, but most importantly by the front benches in Parliament."" Labour's candidate Azhar Ali, who had backed an immediate ceasefire in Gaza before Keir Starmer's calls this week for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", was disowned by the party when a recording of him making allegedly antisemitic comments emerged, for which he apologised. Labour members in the town were ordered to stop campaigning for him - and the shutters came down on the party's campaign headquarters. But Mr Ali is still officially Labour's candidate - that's how he will appear on the ballot paper this coming Thursday because it was legally too late to change. If he is elected, he will sit in the Commons as an independent MP. But it was clear from speaking to voters in the rain-lashed town centre on Tuesday evening that some Labour supporters were either not aware of him being dropped by the party or did not care. Paul Walsh, a 56-year-old roofer, said he knew all about the controversy but he was still going to vote Labour anyway. Rumours had been swirling that Mr Ali's supporters were still campaigning for him - although there was little evidence of this beyond some mocked up social media images depicting Keir Starmer as a clown. On Thursday, Mr Ali broke cover to say that these images had nothing to do with him. In a statement, he said that he had been ""a Labour supporter for more than 30 years and has Labour values"". He added that he was campaigning and standing to be Rochdale's MP and that Sir Tony was a friend and he ""wants to continue his good work"". Little wonder some voters seem confused about who to back. Wendy Fleming, who recently moved to Rochdale from Ireland, half-jokingly suggests that the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate Ravin Rodent Subortna seems to be the only one talking sense. ""That actually hurts my soul,"" she says. ""Voting is something I really do take seriously, always have done, but this time it's so difficult. It's really just going to be the best of a bad bunch."" Just about everyone you speak to is fed up with the bad press Rochdale has received in recent years. The town, in the foothills of the Pennines, has a proud history - it was the birthplace of the Cooperative movement and 1930s film legend Gracie Fields. But it has recently become associated with child sexual exploitation and grooming - something that is an issue at the ballot box, with William Howarth standing as the Parents Against Grooming UK candidate. The town centre has had a makeover, with a new shopping centre, and its Grade I listed town hall has just benefited from a £20m restoration. But social deprivation' , poor housing and crime are rife. George Galloway is eager not to be seen as a single-issue campaigner and is promising to ""make Rochdale great again"". He is calling for the local hospital's maternity ward to be re-opened - and has even promised to help save the local football club, Rochdale AFC, which is facing bankruptcy after being relegated from the Football League. Many young Muslim voters in the town have been energised by his campaign - both for its focus on Gaza and his promise to tackle the town's social ills. Area Shakeel, who is studying to be a mental health nurse and volunteers at a local soup kitchen, says: ""He's actually listened to our views and our opinions in a diverse community - you feel like you are being heard when you are speaking to him."" But the man who sees himself as Mr Galloway's main rival, the town's former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, accuses him of ignoring the majority of voters in the town, who, he says, are ""white, working people"". Mr Danczuk, who was suspended by the Labour Party in 2015 for sending explicit messages to a 17-year-old girl, something he now dismisses as ""tabloid nonsense"", is standing for Reform UK. He insists his ""old Labour values"" are perfectly in tune with Reform - normally seen as being to the right of the Tory Party. He says he voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but ""only just"" so has no problem with being the candidate for the former Brexit Party. He says his focus is ""100% on Rochdale"", tackling crime and taking a hard line on immigration. ""What we have seen over time is places like Rochdale, a proud Lancashire town, its culture and ethos diluted by ridiculous amounts of asylum seekers being placed here,"" he says. Mr Danczuk says he and Mr Galloway, both former Labour MPs, have shared platforms in the past. But those days are long gone. ""He's a chancer, a grifter,"" says Mr Danczuk, who highlights the former Respect MP's record of standing for election - in some cases with great success - in areas with large Muslim populations. ""He's gone from Bradford to Tower Hamlets, now he's showing up in Rochdale. He should take his daft hat, his fat cigars and his extremist policies back to wherever he comes from."" Mr Galloway initially says he won't dignify this with a response, but can't resist a jibe of his own. ""Being called a chancer by Simon Danczuk - it's a bit like being told to stand up straight by the Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" he says. After being expelled from Labour in 2003 over his stance on the Iraq war, he has defeated Labour in Bethnal Green, in east London, for the anti-war Respect Party and - in one of the biggest by-election upsets of recent times - in Bradford West, in 2012. He says he wants to use Rochdale as a launchpad for his Workers Party of Britain, which is trying to recruit 50 candidates to send a message to Keir Starmer at the general election. Andrew Johnson, a 62-year-old housing campaigner, says he is worried about ""sectarianism"" if Galloway is elected and is voting Reform because it ""would be inappropriate, I think, to vote someone who is more concerned about things that are going on thousands of miles away than streets away"". But Samur Mushtaq, a local restaurant owner and community campaigner, says he has been alarmed by the ""inflammatory rhetoric"" from the Danczuk campaign. ""Personally, I just want a local MP who is going to represent the community well,"" he says, adding that he is ""veering towards the Liberal Democrats"". Rochdale was a Lib Dem stronghold not so long ago and the party's candidate Iain Donaldson believes it can be again. He backs a ceasefire in Gaza and an eventual ""two-state solution"" in the Middle East but is focusing his campaign on tackling ""child poverty and poor quality housing"" in Rochdale, among other local issues. The Conservatives also have a strong following in the constituency, particularly in the more affluent suburbs and villages. They came second at the 2019 general election, with 14,000 votes. The Tory candidate, Paul Ellison, who runs a landscaping firm, is also campaigning on ""bread and butter"" issues like crime and local businesses. He was on holiday when we were in Rochdale, but James Daly, MP for nearby Bury North, insisted the party was ""fighting for every vote"". Roy Smethurst, out walking his dog Sunny in the pouring rain in Littleborough, a village just outside Rochdale, says he will be voting Conservative. ""I used to be proud to be a Rochdalian,"" he says, adding: ""It's just not the same town I was brought up in or it doesn't seem to be to me."" He is no fan of George Galloway and his focus on Gaza. ""We are not going to influence what happens in the Middle East. It's just not going to happen."" Another twist, in an already tortuous by-election comes courtesy of the Green Party, which disowned its candidate Guy Otten over old social media posts about the Muslim faith and the conflict in Gaza. The Greens are now campaigning for independent candidate Mark Coleman, a retired vicar and Just Stop Oil activist who has previously been jailed for non-violent direct action. Mr Coleman says his message is going over well with voters but cheerfully admits that he faces a court appearance in London just before polling day over his latest conviction. He says he hopes to avoid a jail sentence this time, after pleading guilty, so he can make it back to Rochdale for the count on Thursday. It's enough to make your head spin. One thing that appears to unite everyone in Rochdale is a sense that the town has been neglected and let down by politicians. Among the 11 candidates standing in the by-election are two local businessmen, David Tully and Michael Howarth. Neither have any political experience but both say they feel compelled to make a stand. Aqub Nazir, who runs youth project Aspire2Inspire, says the rise of independent candidates - and the number of people getting involved in community projects across the town - is a positive sign that people are willing to work for change. ""There is a massive demand now for someone locally to stand up who is actually going to care for Rochdale as a community,"" he says. ""I don't like to say it, but it's one of the most deprived areas in the whole of the United Kingdom so who is actually going to be doing work on the ground in Rochdale?""","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68375450",1

"70","Just Stop Oil: Chris Packham speaks out against protesters' jail terms","By Matt Knight",2023-08-02,"Naturalist Chris Packham said the ""inconvenience"" of traffic jam disruption needed to be put in perspective after two Just Stop Oil activists lost their High Court appeal. Morgan Trowland, 40, and Marcus Decker, 34, were convicted of causing a public nuisance for scaling the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in October. Judges said their jail terms - of three years and two years and seven months respectively - were ""not excessive"". Packham said the sentences were wrong. ""This does seem to be a particularly onerous and vindictive punishment and we see far lesser sentences handed out to crimes that most people would think would be far more dangerous. ""Just Stop Oil don't hurt people. They are scattering paint and litter and so on but there are no human victims of that,"" the broadcaster told BBC Essex. Packham, who visited Decker in prison, said those in the Just Stop Oil movement were ""terrified"" at the climate crisis and urged the public to keep things in perspective. ""Our temperature has now got to the point where our planet is boiling, that's the term that's been used by the UN secretary general [Antonio] Guterres. ""People are losing their lives, they're losing their livelihoods all over the world and the inconvenience faced in a traffic jam, albeit significant if you do miss those funerals, we need to keep a perspective between that and what's going on in other parts of the world and what is likely to be going on here very, very soon,"" he said. Trowland, of Islington in north London, and Decker, of no fixed address, climbed the bridge's cables at about 04:00 BST on 17 October and were eventually brought down using a cherry picker crane at about 17:30 the following day. They were found guilty of causing public nuisance by a jury at Basildon Crown Court in April. The protesters' lawyers made a bid to challenge the ""extraordinary length"" of their sentences. But Lady Justice Sue Carr, sitting with Mrs Justice Johanna Cutts and Mrs Justice Justine Thornton, said: ""Whilst the protest was non-violent as such, it had extreme consequences for many, many members of the public."" Laura O'Brien, Decker's lawyer from Hodge Jones and Allen, said they were ""shocked and saddened"" at the appeal rejection and were considering their options going forward.

"73","Dale Vince: Major Labour donor to stop funding Just Stop Oil","By Paul Seddon",2023-10-06,"Businessman Dale Vince is to stop funding Just Stop Oil, saying further protests from the activist group would be ""counterproductive"". Mr Vince, a major Labour donor, said further action was ""pointless"" because the government had shown it would drill for oil ""come what may"". Further disruption, he added, would help ""feed the Tories' culture-war narrative"". Instead, he said, he would divert funding to the anti-Conservative vote. Writing for the Guardian, he wrote: ""In order to 'just stop oil', first we need to just stop the Tories,"" adding that he wanted to dedicate his ""time, energy and funding"" towards increasing the youth vote. ""A vote for anyone other than Labour, or no vote at all, is a vote for another Tory government - this time with a mandate to pursue its anti-green crusade"". Mr Vince said he had supported Just Stop Oil since its foundation in February 2022, and given the group £340,000 to help its campaign against oil drilling in the North Sea. He said he had always defended the group's tactics, which have included blocking major roads, as well as disrupting high-profile events including Premier League football games and Test cricket at Lord's. But he added that the government - which granted 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences over the summer - had ""made clear that no amount of protest will sway it"". Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said the government would ""welcome more disruption,"" adding Just Stop Oil's tactics had been ""weaponised by the Conservative party"". He added it would also feed a ""culture war"" started by the government with its shift on green policies last month. ""They think they've struck electoral gold here in being anti-green,"" he said. He said Labour had not influenced his decision to stop his funding for the group, saying: ""this is completely my own decision"". Mr Vince's green energy company Ecotricity has donated more than £1.4m to Labour since 2014, comprising donations to the party itself as well as leader Sir Keir Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner. The company also donated £70,000 to the Liberal Democrats in 2015/16, and £30,000 to the Green Party in 2013. Although there is no suggestion Just Stop Oil has funded Labour, Mr Vince's status as a backer of the group has sparked calls from Conservatives for Labour to return donations from him, arguing it legitimises their tactics. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also sought to highlight Mr Vince's support, saying it showed ""eco-zealots"" from Just Stop Oil are ""writing Keir Starmer's energy policy"". Labour has rejected suggestions Just Stop Oil influences its policies, and defended receiving donations from Mr Vince, saying he is a ""perfectly legitimate person"" to accept money from. Indeed, in recent months Sir Keir has become increasingly critical of the group, calling its activists ""wrong"" and ""arrogant"". Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments, but says it will honour any licences in existence at the time of the next election, expected next year. The impact of Mr Vince ending his support for Just Stop Oil is unclear. According to its website, most of its money comes from the Climate Emergency Fund - a US network set up in 2019 to fund climate activism. Just Stop Oil says it also receives donations from the public and other organisations concerned about climate change. In a statement, Just Stop Oil told the BBC it was grateful to Mr Vince for his ""amazing financial and moral support over the past year"". The group said civil resistance ""really works"" - and it believed Labour had ""no intention of stopping"" the oil and gas projects the government was ""furiously rubber-stamping"". ""We remain convinced that politics is broken and the Labour Party are moral cowards,"" Just Stop Oil added.

"74","Ulez: Policing minister Chris Philp in Facebook group that praises camera vandalism",NA,2023-09-28,"Minister for Policing and MP for Croydon South Chris Philp is a member of a social media group some of whose members have celebrated the vandalism of Ulez cameras. The Facebook group, ""Croydon say no to ULEZ expansion"", also has six administrators, one of whom is listed as the mayor of Croydon, Jason Perry. The 2,000-strong group includes posts praising vandalism. Conservative MP Mr Philp said he condemned criminal damage of cameras. Tory mayor Mr Perry, who has not posted pictures of any damaged cameras, said: ""Firstly, I want to be clear that I disagree with any and all criminal damage and violence. The illegal act of vandalising cameras and letting down car tyres is wrong, no matter whether you are protesting against Ulez or a member of Just Stop Oil. ""The rules for the Facebook Group clearly say that encouraging illegal activity is not allowed, and my moderating team do their best to remove any posts which break the rules - but they are volunteers and cannot be expected to catch every comment. ""What is also clear though is that there is a huge strength of feeling in Croydon against Sadiq Khan's Ulez expansion. He has completely ignored our borough by improperly excluding opposing responses to his official consultation, trying to silence scientists, and issuing legal threats to the Council. I am not surprised that people are angry at his £12.50 daily charge on some of the poorest and most vulnerable in my constituency - but that anger should be directed through the ballot box next May."" The ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) was expanded on 29 August to include outer London, with cameras installed to enforce it. Drivers must pay a charge of £12.50 per day to drive a non-compliant vehicle anywhere in the zone under the London Labour mayor's controversial clean-air plan. Of the local anti-Ulez Facebook group, Mr Philp said he ""could not be held responsible for what others post"". ""I completely condemn law-breaking and criminal damage, including in relation to Ulez cameras, much though I disagree with Ulez itself. ""I have already publicly stated my opposition to, and condemnation of, criminal damage to the cameras. ""I cannot be expected to reply to hundreds or thousands of other people's comments on social media platforms."" The group includes multiple pictures of vandalised cameras and posts in support for the continued vandalising of them. This is despite the group rules stating: ""Please do not post any content or comment which encourages the vandalism of Ulez cameras"" At least 510 Ulez cameras were stolen or vandalised between 1 April and the end of August this year, figures from the Metropolitan Police show. The force is dedicating a ""significant amount"" of resources to tackling Ulez camera-related crime, Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has said. Barry Gardiner, Labour MP for Brent North, told the BBC it was ""deeply concerning"" and that ""the police minister and mayor of Croydon should immediately shut down this Facebook group, apologise, and make clear they condemn any criminal activity or damage."" A spokesperson for London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: ""People are of course entitled to show their opposition to policies peacefully and lawfully. But causing or promoting criminal damage is never acceptable. ""All incidents of Ulez camera vandalism are reported to the police for investigation, arrests have been made and the Met and TfL are using new methods to catch those responsible.""","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-66939644",1

Oxford University said the main entrance and exit to the reading room were closed because of a Just Stop Oil protest shortly after midday. The group said student supporters painted the building in protest at the government's plans to licence new oil and gas projects. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thames Valley Police said it received reports of criminal damage on Radcliffe Square in Oxford at about 12:25 BST. The force said a 21-year-old man, from Oxford, and a 18-year-old man, from Norwich, had been detained and remained in police custody. The university said the building had been ""vandalised with orange spray paint"". ""The university does not support illegal action, including any unlawful protesting, and may, within its powers, take any steps it considers appropriate against any student guilty of such behaviour,"" it said. ""Access to the library has been temporarily redirected and steps are under way to remove the paint."" In a statement released by Just Stop Oil, a protester said they were calling on ""university leaders all over the country to make a public statement calling on the government to end new oil and gas projects"". Last month the Rosebank oil field, the UK's largest untapped oil field estimated to contain up to 300 million barrels of oil, was given the go-ahead by regulators. Thames Valley's police and crime commissioner (PCC) Matthew Barber called the protest action ""mindless vandalism"". ""Protest is vitally important to our democracy, but this isn't protest, it is simply criminal damage and I think such tactics have long ago stopped persuading anyone and instead alienate the majority,"" he added.

The Daily Telegraph - among others - headlines the corporation's move to refer the matter to the police. According to the Daily Mail, the director general was not made aware of the allegations until last Thursday because bosses didn't at first register the seriousness of the claims. The Sun says the BBC has a ""sorry history of ignoring complaints and rumours about its own presenters, sometimes with appalling consequences."" The Financial Times reports that the US and Germany are under ""intense"" pressure from other allies to show greater support for Ukraine's eventual membership of Nato. The paper says both countries have backed a form of words for the concluding statement of the forthcoming Nato summit that does not fully endorse a ""pathway"" for Ukraine to join. And the Daily Telegraph says that an interview Joe Biden did with CNN - in which he said that he didn't think Ukraine was ""ready"" to join Nato - was considered by some Tory MPs as ""snub"" to Rishi Sunak ahead of their meeting today. The paper quotes former cabinet minister - David Jones - as saying that it ""would appear the US President had decided to side with a reluctant Germany, rather than with America's closest ally - Britain"". The Guardian's front page reveals it has discovered that more than 50 MPs have owned stakes in public limited companies - like energy suppliers and supermarkets. It reports that the information does not have to be disclosed in Parliamentary registers - unless the shares are worth more than £70,000 - and has, in effect, been ""secret"" until now. But the paper says it raises questions about possible conflicts of interest. Judges are being ""urged to get tough with Just Stop Oil protestors"" according to a story on the Times front page. The paper reports that ministers and police chiefs want judges to hand down longer sentences to deter the environmental campaigners from disrupting sporting events. It says they want the ""wider risk"" to the public - from pitch invasions and stunts - to be taken into account. Warmer springs are causing problems for British bumblebees - according to a big study featured in the Daily Mail. The paper says it shows the wild bees emerge from their nests six and a half days earlier - on average - for every one degree rise in temperature. It means - researchers say - that they could end up ""out of sync"" with the plants on which they depend for food, and that they may not be able to pollinate ""effectively"". The Times reports that drinkers at Wimbledon are being told to ""put a cork in it"" - after a player was put off her serve by a popping champagne bottle. It led to the Australian umpire John Blum issuing a public warning. This was described by one commentator as ""the most Wimbledon warning ever heard"". And the Sun features a story about Portia the pot-bellied pig - who has been rescued from a flat in Manchester.

Russians will now see Putin is someone far weaker, according to the Sunday Express which claims the leader ""fled"" Moscow as mercenaries approached the capital.

The protest was similar to those carried out by the environmental group. But, a spokesperson told the BBC they did not know the protester's identity. The group had posted a clip from news agency PA on Twitter with the message: ""You look good in orange George Osborne."" In the video a woman in a smart floral dress approaches George Osborne and Thea Rogers as they leave the church and begins throwing confetti, taken from a union jack paper bag. In a statement the group said: ""If it was a form of protest (which is yet to be established) we applaud it and thank the person concerned.

The group added that the media should focus on more important issues including the government's decision to license over 100 new oil and gas projects and wildfires in Canada. It came as an email, widely shared online, made several unsubstantiated claims about Mr Osborne's private life. Reports suggest Mr Osborne has contacted the police about the email. Around 200 people, including ex-Prime Minister David Cameron and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove attended the ceremony in the village of Bruton, Somerset.

Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Mr Ward challenged prosecutors to prove his intention and whether his actions disrupted the match. He is to stand trial in November. Mr Ward, a retired civil engineer from Epsom, Surrey, allegedly invaded the court during a match between Briton Katie Boulter and Australian Daria Saville at about 16:30 BST. He was later charged with aggravated trespass. Representing himself in court, Mr Ward denied causing disruption, saying the protest was timed for when the two players were taking a break. The defendant also disputed that the crowd was hostile towards him, arguing there was a mostly positive reaction. Mr Ward said he was forcefully dragged off the court by security officials. Followers of JSO, which calls for the government to halt all new oil, gas and coal projects, have disrupted several sporting events this year, including the Ashes, the rugby union Premiership final and the World Snooker Championship.

Retired teacher Gaie Delap, from Bristol, took part in a Just Stop Oil protest on the M25 in November 2022. She told a judge she did it for the future of her grandchildren. Ms Delap, 76, is one of 12 Stop Oil protesters accused of breaching a court injunction aimed at restricting protest and disruption on the motorway. Several junctions across Surrey, London, Essex and Kent were affected by the Just Stop Oil action. Mr Justice Soole is overseeing a hearing at the High Court in London which is expected to end later this week. She told the judge on Tuesday a policeman had greeted her with ""some surprise"". Ms Delap, a mother of two, said she had been given climbing training by a Just Stop Oil mentor before taking part in the protest. Lawyers representing National Highways said protesters caused ""considerable delays"" and were in contempt of court. Ms Delap said she was unaware that an injunction was in place and apologised - other defendants said the same. She told the judge she had joined the protest after Just Stop Oil called for volunteers. ""I heard a Just Stop Oil Zoom call for climbers to volunteer,"" Ms Delap said. ""I thought, well, I am 76, I have never had any climbing experience, I didn't think I had to volunteer for that. But it went onto my mind and stayed there. ""I then followed it up with an inquiry about how I might get involved."" Ms Delap, who said demonstrators had gone to a ""safe house"" the night before the protest, said she had climbed a ladder and sat on the gantry. Ms Delap added: ""Why did I do it? ""My heart is breaking for the future of my six grandchildren and all future generations."" She told the judge that Just Stop Oil wanted the government to ""stop new oil and gas"" and said ""the climate emergency is a serious issue and it has not been taken seriously enough"".

The Met Police said two activists had been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage. Just Stop Oil named the pair as Hanan, 22, and Harrison, 20, and said safety hammers were used to smash the glass. Meanwhile, police said about 100 Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested after slow marching in the road at Whitehall. The vandalised artwork, by Diego Velazquez in the 1600s, was previously slashed by suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. Following the latest incident, Just Stop Oil (JSO) said: ""Women did not get the vote by voting, it is time for deeds not words. It is time to Just Stop Oil. ""Politics is failing us. It failed women in 1914 and it is failing us now. New oil and gas will kill millions. If we love art, if we love life, if we love our families we must Just Stop Oil."" There had been reports that activists had targeted the Cenotaph memorial - action that has been criticised by MPs and the mayor - but the group and the police have denied these claims. Sadiq Khan and Labour's shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, both said that targeting the monument was ""unacceptable"" in X posts now deleted. Tory party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said that JSO were ""now stuck to the Cenotaph"" as he shared a picture on social media site X. The activists said they had been moved to the base of the monument after shutting down traffic on Whitehall, an account supported by one officer at the scene. The Met Police confirmed that there were no offences linked to the Cenotaph and no protester glued themselves to the road. They added that the arrests were made for breaching section 7 of the Public Order Act at various points between Trafalgar Square, Parliament Square and near to the Cenotaph. Protesters failing to engage with officers can be arrested under section seven of the Public Order Act introduced this year. It states that an arrest can be made if their actions ""interfere with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure in England and Wales"". The government said the new measures would not ban protests, but ""only prevent a small minority of individuals from causing serious disruption to the daily lives of the public"". Human rights group Liberty responded to the arrests, saying: ""The use of this new power is a dangerous escalation of the attack on the right to protest, with protesters potentially facing up to a year in prison for standing up for what they believe in. ""These arrests are a clear attempt to criminalise people for exercising that right. The government, in passing these new laws, has tried to make it even harder for the public to stand up to power.""

Trowland was jailed for three years, and Decker for two years and seven months, following a trial. Their appeals were rejected by three senior judges, who said the sentences were ""not excessive"". At a hearing in London last week, the protesters' lawyers made a bid to challenge the ""extraordinary length"" of Trowland's three-year sentence and Decker's jail term of two years and seven months. But Lady Justice Sue Carr, sitting with Mrs Justice Johanna Cutts and Mrs Justice Justine Thornton, said: ""This was very serious offending by repeat protest offenders who were trespassers and on bail at the time. ""Whilst the protest was non-violent as such, it had extreme consequences for many, many members of the public."" The judges acknowledged the ""long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds"" and that the sentences handed to Trowland and Decker went ""well beyond previous sentences imposed for this type of offending"". But Lady Justice Carr said the jail terms reflected ""Parliament's will"" under new laws enacted under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act last year which introduced a new ""fault-based public nuisance offence for what obviously will include non-violent protest behaviour, with a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment"". Structural engineer Trowland, of Islington in north London, and Decker, a private tutor of no fixed address, climbed the bridge's cables at about 04:00 BST on 17 October and were eventually brought down using a cherry picker crane at about 17:30 the following day.

"88","Police to be given clearer powers on slow-walk protests","By Joshua Nevett",2023-06-13,"Police in England and Wales are to be given clearer powers to stop protests deemed to be seriously disruptive, in a law approved by Parliament. The House of Lords voted through the new regulations, despite an attempt to block them by an opposition peer. The new law gives officers more leeway to intervene when protesters attempt to block roads with slow marching. The tactic has been used by protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain. The new law follows last month's passage of the Public Order Act, legislation designed to beef up police powers to clamp down on protests judged to be disruptive. The government says the new regulations are needed because the police lack clarity on when their existing powers can be used. The regulations lower the threshold for what kind of protest activity is considered ""serious disruption"". Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the impact of ""disruptors"" from certain protest groups had been ""huge"" and ""the police must be able to stop this happening"". But critics have branded the new measures an attack on the right to protest and argue that the police are already capable of stopping slow-walking demonstrations under current laws. The regulations were backed by MPs in a vote on Monday, with 277 in favour and 217 against. In the House of Lords on Tuesday, some opposition peers tried some parliamentary manoeuvres to prevent the regulations from becoming law. Ministers had already tried to ban slow-walking protests by adding measures to the Public Order Act but were narrowly defeated by peers. Given this, Baroness Jones, a Green peer, had tabled a ""fatal motion"", which invited members to decline to approve the regulations because Parliament had already rejected them. Urging peers to back her motion, Baroness Jones said this was an ""authoritarian law that hands power to decide what is a good protest or a bad protest over to the police and the Home Office"". She said the law was ""being enacted in an authoritarian manner by ministerial decree"". Home Office minister Lord Sharpe called the baroness' motion ""highly unusual"", arguing it sought ""to strike down legislation passed by the elected House and undermine sensible changes, which bring clarity and consistency to the law"". The baroness' motion was not successful, with peers voting against it by 68 votes to 154, a majority of 86. While peers condemned the government's actions in bringing back regulations that had been previously rejected by peers in primary legislation, Labour did not support the fatal motion, because of a convention to accept the will of the elected House of Commons. A few minutes earlier, peers had backed a Labour ""regret motion"" - which set out criticisms of the regulations but did not block them - by 177 votes to 141. Police have been under a lot of pressure from politicians over how they handle protests with recent actions by Just Stop Oil. But the powers given to police in the Public Order Act were criticised as too crude and too broad, following the arrest of anti-monarchy protesters on the day of King Charles's Coronation. The 2023 Public Order Act is the government's second major piece of legislation changing protest laws in under two years. In 2022, MPs voted to place greater restrictions on public processions if they were too noisy.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65897513",1

Memorable events might include the coronation of the King or Just Stop Oil protesters throwing orange paint at a flower show. Or perhaps London's New Year's Eve fireworks display that people attended for the first time since the pandemic? BBC London has selected a ""picture of the day"" representing each month, as published on its Instagram account. So here, we look back at images from the capital from January to December. London Zoo released an image of a baby two-toed sloth which was born on New Year's Day. Zoo sloth keeper Veronica Heldt said: ""We were delighted to finally spot a tiny baby exactly where it should be, clinging on to its mother's tummy. ""We've nicknamed the little one Nova, which means 'new' in Latin, as we couldn't have asked for a better start to the new year."" Fun fact: To accommodate their upside-down lifestyle, sloths are the only mammals whose hair grows upwards - it parts in the middle of the belly and grows upward toward the back. The hair on the face points upward too. This allows water to run off during rainstorms. On 6 February 2023 an earthquake struck southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria. There was widespread damage and tens of thousands of fatalities. London has thriving Turkish, Kurdish and Syrian communities that were severely affected and many Londoners were quick to rally to support rescue efforts. For the first time, London's West End was lit with 30,000 lights to mark the holy month of Ramadan. The lights were switched on by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who is one of the 1.3 million Muslims in London who celebrate the event. The original BBC London caption for this picture - of a Star Wars fan dressed as an Imperial Death Trooper arriving at the ExCeL convention centre - was ""Why use an Oyster card when you can use the force?"" To which someone immediately replied: ""It's unlikely that an Empire trooper would be force sensitive."" Which BBC London, sadly, did not respond with: ""I find your lack of faith disturbing."" To celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III, a giant 16ft replica of St Edward's Crown was set up near Marble Arch. The huge hat weighed 300kg and featured 36 different coloured glass stones. It also lit up at night - much like King Charles's crown, which he uses after nightfall to light his way through the 775-room Buckingham Palace. Probably. The HMT Empire Windrush, carrying passengers from the Caribbean to the UK, docked on 22 June 75 years ago. Windrush Day was marked with live coverage from the BBC, a national commemoration service was held at Southwark Cathedral, and a celebratory procession paraded from Herne Hill to Brixton. The Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election, triggered by Boris Johnson's resignation, prompted this picture of a Very Good Boy. Every election period animal welfare charity Blue Cross gamely fields questions about pets and polling stations, including: Can my dog vote for me? (No). Can I ask my dog who they think I should vote for? (Yes). Does my dog get a vote? (No). And as a bonus, here are some more pictures of dogs outside polling stations. Football almost came home in August as the Lionesses carried the hopes of English fans at the Women's World Cup. The Welsh Guards Band and their instruments got involved in the semi-final, in which England beat Australia 3-1. Ultimately, though, football must have forgotten its ticket back. It stayed away as the Lionesses lost 1-0 to Spain in the final. September saw the one-year anniversary of the Queen's death. Gun salutes were fired in cities across Britain and the bells of Westminster Abbey echoed across London. Well-wishers left tributes and flowers at Buckingham Palace. Don't drop it - the world's most valuable whisky, with an estimated value of £750,000 to £1.2m, was paraded before the cameras ahead of an auction at Sotheby's. That valuation, though, was nonsense. The drink sold for £2.1m - almost twice as much as its highest estimate. Christmas seems to start earlier and earlier every year. This year it started in the late Cretaceous period - 66 to 90 million years ago, with the T-Rex at the Natural History Museum donning a traditional prehistoric jumper. To say something is ""copper-bottomed"" means that it is entirely reliable, while ""copper topped"" indicates a person with auburn hair. The soon-to-be museum of London, with its shiny copper-clad roof, is neither - but has been described by London's mayor Sadiq Khan as ""a major landmark that will be a jewel in our crown"". Which sounds better than either.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67797087",1
"90","Prevent: Rise in climate activists referred to anti-terror scheme","By Joshua Nevett",2023-12-23,"The number of climate activists referred to the Prevent anti-terrorism programme has increased following the emergence of disruptive environmental protests, the BBC has learned. The UK government's Prevent scheme aims to stop people becoming terrorists. Critics say Prevent curbs human rights by stifling non-violent political beliefs and should be reformed. The government says it has never advised referring people to Prevent for lawful climate activism or protest. Anyone can contact the police or a local authority to make a Prevent referral, which usually involves filling out a form to explain a concern about someone deemed to be at risk of radicalisation. Since 2015, institutions including schools, universities, hospitals, local authorities, police, and prisons have had a legal duty to consider the risk of radicalisation. The Home Office told the BBC Prevent interventions were legitimate for those who could be radicalised into terrorism in the name of environmental causes. But climate activists say the government's definition of extremism is too broad and authorities are confusing extremism with non-violent civil disobedience in too many cases. Sir Peter Fahy, a former national police lead for Prevent, said it was ""inappropriate"" to treat non-violent climate activists as potential terrorists. He said the fear of being flagged to police in a Prevent referral could deter people from protesting, and argued the rise in environmental cases reasons ""shows how confused we've become about all of this"". ""Prevent has been and should be about people who want to take their extremism into violent action,"" Sir Peter said. Prevent has mainly focused on Islamist and far-right terrorism but it does try to counter other types of extremism. The government groups ""eco-terrorism"" in a category of violent extremism motivated by ideas on ""the extreme political left-wing"". It says although this category does not represent a significant threat, some activity has met a terrorist threshold in recent years and security services continue to investigate such cases. There have been ""a small number of instances of terrorist behaviour that have been motivated by an environmentalist ideology"", the Home Office said. In response to a freedom of information request, the UK's police chiefs told the BBC there were 32 Prevent referrals for ""Left Wing - Environmental"" reasons between 2015 and 2022. There was a notable spike in referrals in 2019, when Extinction Rebellion - a climate group known for its disruptive protests - came to prominence with large demonstrations in the UK and internationally. The BBC has spoken to one climate activist who was assessed by Prevent. They said they did not wish to be named in this report because they feared they would lose their job. The climate activist was referred to Prevent by their employer after being arrested at an Extinction Rebellion protest. The person has been cautioned by police and convicted for public order offences committed at disruptive environmental protests. The BBC has seen a copy of the form used to refer the climate activist to Prevent. The form says they were referred ""due to being a member of Extinction Rebellion and other splinter groups"". The form says the groups ""are not considered extreme in themselves, but individuals within them may hold extremist views"". The climate activist was assessed by a multi-agency safeguarding team and they said no further action was taken. When people are referred to Prevent, the police decide whether or not they need more comprehensive intervention through a process called Channel. The Home Office said there were fewer than 10 referrals for environmental reasons each year between 2015 and 2022, but refused to release specific figures, citing safety and privacy concerns. The number of Prevent referrals adopted as Channel cases for all reasons is relatively small every year, representing 9% of the total in 2022-23. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Lawful protest or activism does not meet the threshold for Prevent referrals and at no point has the government advised referring people simply for climate activism. ""Prevent is an early intervention programme which seeks to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism, regardless of the ideology. If a person is not at risk of radicalisation then their case will be closed to Prevent."" A controversial strand of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy, Prevent was set up by Tony Blair's government in the 2003 following the 9/11 attacks. A key moment in its evolution came in 2015, with the introduction of the legal duty on schools and other institutions to report those deemed at risk of radicalisation. Human rights activists have long accused Prevent of demonising Muslims, and having a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Earlier this year, Amnesty International urged the UK government to scrap the Prevent duty in a report condemning its impact on human rights. ""People are being referred to Prevent for non-violent political beliefs,"" said Ilyas Nagdee, Amnesty International UK's racial justice director. But Lord Carlile, who reviewed the scheme for the government in 2011, said environmental protesters who ""presented as potentially violent extremists are properly referable to Prevent"". He said there was a ""superficiality to analysis based on numbers and on descriptions as brief as 'environmental activist' without looking at the context"" of each referral. Lord Carlile said while the programme could be improved, he did not agree with those who argued it should be scrapped because ""some environmental activists were allegedly drawn into Prevent"". He said counter-terrorism was ""not science"" and ""the police have a very difficult job"", arguing: ""You can't just write off Prevent because there have been some mistakes, any more than you can write off the police for arresting people who later are not charged."" Most referrals to Prevent are made in the education sector, where training to understand the risk of radicalisation is encouraged. In its Prevent report, Amnesty found some training materials listed environmental causes ""as potential forms of an ill-defined extremism that can lead to a referral"". Mat Osmond, who's a senior lecturer at Falmouth University in Cornwall, told the BBC his employer asked him to re-take Prevent training after he helped to organise a student Just Stop Oil talk on campus last year. He accepted he did not follow the university's Prevent procedures when booking a room. He said the training was about ""spotting the signs of radicalisation in students"" and had no relevance to room-booking procedures at his university. Outside work, Mr Osmond has been involved in climate activism himself. In October this year, he was found guilty of obstructing a road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest in London and was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge. When asked if he regretted his actions, Mr Osmond said he found obstructing ""random fellow citizens"" a ""deeply uncomfortable"" thing to do. But he said he would make ""a categorical distinction between being drawn into violent extremism"" and ""taking action with non-violent resistance campaigns"". David Knowles echoed this distinction. A former Prevent national lead within education, he had a significant role in the introduction of the legal duty in 2015. He said he didn't come across any environmental extremism when he was working in counter-terrorism. Mr Knowles said: ""Breaking the law doesn't mean you oppose democracy or the rule of law because, let's face it, lots of people in this country have protested and successfully changed the law. ""So people who might glue themselves to the road, to me, are not extremists."" But he said Prevent was a vital part of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy and should be allowed to continue to protect people ""from all forms of harm and risk"". ""Prevent is about safeguarding people away from extremism and terrorism, and it's not about supressing free speech at all,"" Mr Knowles said.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67665218",1
"91","Just Stop Oil: What is it and what are its goals?",NA,2024-06-19,"Just Stop Oil activists have sprayed orange powder paint on parts of Stonehenge. The environmental campaign group has carried out many high-profile protests, including blocking roads, stopping play at sports matches and halting theatre productions. It wants action on climate change, but its tactics are controversial. Just Stop Oil (JSO) wants the UK to stop approving new fossil fuel projects, which are a major cause of climate change. However, in July 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that 100 new North Sea licences had been granted. And in November, he said further licences would be awarded annually. The group says it uses ""non-violent civil resistance"" and will stop protesting when the government announces an end to fossil-fuel production. Just Stop Oil is linked to other environmental groups, including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain. The group came to prominence when its activists shut down major roads such as the M25 and Dartford crossing in November 2022. Since then, JSO has also targeted several major sporting events, including the Wimbledon tennis championships, the second Ashes Test at Lord's cricket ground and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield. Cultural events, including a performance of the musical Les Miserables in London and a BBC Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall, have also been disrupted. In the National Gallery, supporters threw tomato soup over Vincent Van Gogh's painting Sunflowers and smashed the protective glass screen on Diego Velazquez's Rokeby Venus. JSO protesters also damaged the case around the Magna Carta, at the British Library. In June 2024, two activists were arrested on suspicion of damaging Stonehenge, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) world heritage site. Just Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and would ""wash away with rain"". English Heritage chief executive, Dr Nick Merriman, said there appeared to be ""no visible damage"" after experts cleaned the site. But Mr Sunak said it was a ""disgraceful act of vandalism"", while Labour leader Keir Starmer called it ""outrageous"" and JSO ""pathetic"". The maximum penalty for the wilful obstruction of a highway in England and Wales is 51 weeks in prison. Offenders can also be fined. Several transport bodies, including National Highways and Transport for London, have sought High Court injunctions to prevent protesters disrupting major roads. Anyone breaching an injunction can be held in contempt of court, and could face imprisonment, an unlimited fine and seizure of assets. In 2023, Parliament passed new anti-protest legislation under the Public Order Act. This gives powers to prosecute someone who interferes with the operation or use of key national infrastructure in England and Wales - including roads, railways, and air transport. Previously, the police could generally only restrict a protest if they could show it may result in ""serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"". The new legislation lowers the threshold for ""serious disruption"", allowing police to respond to action which prevents or delays day-to-day activities such as completing a journey. It also made ""locking-on"" - whereby protesters attach themselves to buildings, objects or other people - a criminal offence. Many Just Stop Oil activists have used this tactic. In May 2024, BBC News reported a review into tackling political violence, by Lord Walney, would suggest ""extreme protest groups"" such as JSO could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. The plan could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate. At the time, the Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations - but the general election was called a few weeks later and it is now unclear when or if Lord Walney's report will be published. In response, JSO said the government were the ""dangerous radicals that are endangering all of us"", through its climate policies. In December 2023, the Met Police said it had spent £20m policing JSO protests and the time spent on the group equated to roughly 300 officers being removed front-line policing each day. It said the group ""refused to engage"" with police when planning protests. ""Our desire is that Just Stop Oil come forward and speak with us, so we can actually work with them,"" Cdr Kyle Gordon said. ""We absolutely understand and support the fundamental right to protest within a democratic society - but what we've got to do is balance that right with the rights of everybody else who is using this city."" In the past Just Stop Oil has quoted a 2021 Supreme Court ruling which found there should be a ""certain degree of tolerance to disruption to ordinary life, including the disruption of traffic"", as a result of non-violent protest. According to its website, most of its money comes from the Climate Emergency Fund - a US network which has supported climate activism since 2019. That is part-funded by US philanthropist Aileen Getty, the granddaughter of petrol tycoon J Paul Getty. Just Stop Oil says it also receives donations from the public and other organisations concerned about climate change.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63543307",1
"92","UN criticises 'severe' Just Stop Oil sentences","By Justin Rowlatt",2023-11-21,"Long jail sentences handed to two Just Stop Oil climate campaigners could stifle protest, the United Nations has warned the UK government. The protesters caused traffic gridlock after scaling the Dartford Crossing Bridge for almost 40 hours in October last year. Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed for three years and Marcus Decker, 34, for two years for causing a public nuisance. In response to the UN, the government said that the right to protest is a fundamental part of the UK’s democracy but that the ""law-abiding majority"" must be able to go about their daily lives. At an appeal hearing last month Lady Chief Justice, Lady Carr defended the sentences, saying they met a ""legitimate"" aim of deterring others from such offending. The activists were refused permission to challenge them in the Supreme Court. The warning comes in a letter shown to BBC News, sent to the government by the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, Ian Fry, on 15 August this year. The sentences are ""significantly more severe than previous sentences imposed for this type of offending in the past,"" Mr Fry notes. He says he is worried about “the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association”. The letter goes on to say the new Public Order Act which came into force in July ""appears to be a direct attack on the right to the freedom of peaceful assembly"". The new legislation includes measures aimed at curbing disruptive protests. The letter sent in mid-August requested a reply within 60 days but has not received one, which the UN special rapporteur described as ""troubling"". ""Most countries take these letters seriously and respond,"" Mr Fry told BBC News. He suggested that the lack of a formal reply reflected ""a general disregard for human rights concerns by the current government"". The Home Office said it had ""responded"" to the special rapporteur’s letter. It said peaceful protest is a vital part of a democratic society and a long-standing tradition in the UK, provided it is done within the law. The new legislation is designed to ""clarify the definition of serious disruption and allow police to clear roads quickly"", it told the BBC, and said the new legislation on protests was put in place following proper parliamentary procedure and is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. “It is a total political failure,"" Morgan Trowland said in a statement to the BBC from prison. ""It is people vs oil, and our government has signalled that it is on the side of oil."" ""By not even responding to the concerns in this letter, the government is showing an extraordinary disregard for our civil liberties,"" said Jodie Beck, Policy and Campaigns Officer at the human rights charity, Liberty. ""Protest is not a gift from the state, it is a fundamental right,"" she added. ""The government should be ensuring demonstrations are safely facilitated and that protest rights are safeguarded."" During last month's appeal hearing, Lady Carr told the court: ""The sentences should not be seen as having a 'chilling effect' on the right to peaceful protest or to assembly more generally - deterrence and 'chilling effect' are not the same."" Lady Carr added that the jail terms reflected ""Parliament’s will"" under new laws carried out under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. At a court hearing in July judges had acknowledged the ""long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds"" and that the sentences handed to Trowland and Decker went ""well beyond previous sentences imposed for this type of offending"".","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0p6ll3jjgo",1

District Judge Stuart Smith found him guilty of damaging the guard's clothes and boots but not guilty of ""minor and trivial"" damage to the paving. His trial heard the Exeter incident came two months after he threw orange powder on a snooker table during televised championships at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Prosecutors at Exeter Magistrates' Court alleged Whittingham's actions were premeditated, not peaceful and a potential risk to people. The court heard he made a video before the protest saying: ""What is the point of education if you are dead?"" The incident lasted about 10 to 15 seconds in a busy area where graduates were having their photographs taken. Whittingham told the court many millions faced death if action was not taken on climate change, and he demanded the government end new oil and gas projects. The judge said the politics and philosophy student held ""genuine beliefs"" on climate change. He added: ""This was not a violent protest.""

The duo mounted the stage and briefly unfurled an orange banner on Friday. They were met with boos and jeers from some members of the audience at the BBC's classical music festival, before being led away by security staff. Just Stop Oil has targeted a number of events this year, including the Ashes, Wimbledon and the Chelsea Flower Show. In a tweet, Just Stop Oil said two of its supporters ran onto the stage to demand ""the UK government immediately halt all new oil and gas consents and licences"". It added ""they attempted to address the audience before being forcibly removed"". The group said the action, which happened shortly after the interval, targeted the event because of the BBC's ""underwhelming coverage of the climate emergency"". The group claimed the protesters had used confetti cannons and air horns, but eyewitnesses denied this and video footage shows the protest was stopped quickly. A BBC spokesman said: ""There was no disruption to the concert or the broadcast during the few seconds the protesters were on stage."" The Proms opening night featured a new translation of Jean Sibelius's Snöfrid, narrated by actress Lesley Manville, and a new work by Ukrainian composer Bohdana Frolyak, called Let The Light In. In response to the incident, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer wrote on social media: ""My message is this: Leave people to enjoy the events they love, and stop damaging your own cause."" During the Proms programme and before the protest, BBC Radio 3 broadcaster Georgia Mann remarked on how close members of the audience were to the performers at the Royal Albert Hall.

"96","Just Stop Oil: Five charged after protesters disrupt Les Miserables","By Sam Hancock",2023-10-05,"Five Just Stop Oil protesters have been charged with aggravated trespass after a performance of Les Miserables in London's West End was halted. A video shared by the activist group showed demonstrators getting up on to the Sondheim Theatre's stage and asking the audience to ""join the rebellion"". Audience members can be heard booing and telling the activists to ""get off"". The show on Wednesday night did not resume - organisers instead offered refunds or tickets for another night. Having arrested five people, aged between 18 and 28, the Metropolitan Police later confirmed that all had been charged. The force also released their names: Catherine Francoise, from Buckinghamshire, was in the audience with a group of more than 30 people who she organises theatre trips for. She said she had been sitting ""in the centre of the front row"" and that people who appeared to be protesters were seated at either end of the second row. Ms Francoise said: ""I could see out the corner of my eye something happening on the left, I noticed first, and I knew it wasn't part of the production. ""The cast were still going, the orchestra was still playing, and after about 15 seconds, somebody came on stage and moved the cast off. ""Meanwhile, security were on it trying to get the girls off that were on the left-hand side."" She said it appeared the protesters had locked themselves to parts of the set. She said that the cast members were removed from the stage, shortly followed by the orchestra, with the audience being asked to leave about 15 minutes later. ""The audience were definitely making far, far more noise than the protesters,"" she said. What is Just Stop Oil and what does it want? The stage invasion happened during the show's famous protest song of Do You Hear the People Sing? It is often described as being about a revolutionary call to action and has been used all over the world by protest movements, including in the 2019 Hong Kong demonstrations. Posting on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday, Just Stop Oil said:"" Valjean steals bread to feed a starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal?"" Jean Valjean is the protagonist in Les Miserables. The post continued: ""The fossil fuel show can't go on."" William Village, chief executive of Delfont Mackintosh Theatres - which owns the Sondheim - said ""safety protocols"" had to be followed and ""the audience were asked to leave the auditorium and the Met Police attended"". ""Regrettably, there was insufficient time to enable us to complete the rest of the performance,"" he said in a statement. ""Whilst we recognise the importance of free expression, we must also respect our audience's right to enjoy the event for which they have paid."" On its website, Just Stop Oil says its ultimate aim is to ""demand that the UK government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects"". Were you at last night's show?

Northamptonshire Police said it would be used to spot those who pose a ""risk of danger to the wider public"". That could include wanted criminals, those involved in serious crime, or ""unlawful protest"", the force said. Det Supt Richard Tompkins said officers had ""thought long and hard"" about the use of the technology. More than 450,000 people are expected at Silverstone this weekend. Mr Tompkins said: ""This is the first time that we will have used it [facial recognition] in Northamptonshire as a police force, and also the first time we've used it here at the British Grand Prix. ""There is a risk of terrorism, of serious crime and of course unlawful protest, which in itself is illegal.

A live facial recognition camera works by comparing faces with a ""watch list"" generated by police. The watch list could be made up of people who are wanted for crimes or pose a risk of harm to themselves and others, the Northamptonshire force said. Any images that trigger alerts are deleted immediately after use or within 24 hours, while those that do not trigger alerts are deleted immediately. The technology was used at the Beyoncé concert in Cardiff in May and during the Coronation. But civil liberties organisation Liberty said the technology should not be used by police forces. On race day last year protesters got on to the Wellington Straight - the fastest point of the Silverstone track. Four men and two women were  in February, with three of the six given suspended prison terms while three others were given 12-month community orders. Mr Tompkins, who was at the circuit in 2022, said: ""I think we were fortunate that we didn't get some deaths either from [the protesters], from members of the public or marshals, who would have become embroiled in that."" Northamptonshire Police said it would also have plain-clothed detectives and armed officers patrolling the circuit, among other measures to prevent disruption to the race. Climate change protesters have recently got on the pitch during an Ashes Test between England and Australia at Lord's and interrupted play twice at Wimbledon. Followers of Just Stop Oil, which calls for the government to halt all new oil, gas and coal projects, also disrupted the rugby union Premiership final and the World Snooker Championship. Mr Tompkins said it would be ""naïve"" to not believe protestors would attempt action at this year's race. He warned the force would ""be taking action and that will ultimately mean we will be looking at arrested individuals and putting them before the courts"".
